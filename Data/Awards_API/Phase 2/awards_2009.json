We also propose to concurrently develop the software and determine the hardware necessary for online, real-time assessment of malintent based on prior research results and the results of the proposed experiments. In addition to oculomotor and pupil activity, we plan on collecting other physiological measures (e.g. electrodermal activity, respiration, cardiovascular measures) with the intent of developing a broader base of measures allowing for assessment of malicious or deceptive intent. Experiments will be conducted within the constraints imposed by the DHS Future Attribute Screening Technology (FAST) environment. The focus is on measures that can be recorded unobtrusively (without the attachment of sensors) and that can provide immediate feedback.",

The program will provide the opportunity to continue research through modeling and simulation for optimization of heavy fuel micro rotary engines, and testing to provide model verification, all in support of converting the Rotary engine from gasoline to heavy fuel.  Utilizing an existing engine design for this Phase II program allows the emphasis to be placed on the analysis (both CFD and Zero-Dimensional Modeling), as well as hardware advancements to achieve the desired results.   Technology advancements in fuel injection and software simulation greatly improve the odds of establishing accurate performance models for a heavy fueled Rotary Engine. Dynamic fluid flow analysis and Zero-dimensional modeling can be utilized to refine advanced fuel delivery methods and rotor geometry, and evaluate induction configurations, resulting in successful operation of a small Rotary Engine capable of running on heavy fuel.",

Past testing by contractors and government labs showed the ability of tin whiskers growing on tin plated components to puncture conformal coatings that currently exist. Starting in 2006 with a \"physics of failure\" approach, the Whisker Tough Project identified the key material properties that determine whether a conformal coating will be punctured by a tin whisker growing beneath it. Whisker Tough is being designed \"from the ground up\" to have the key material properties that will prevent tin whisker punctures. This will allow military hardware to be built using tin-plated lead-free commercial electronic components, and then coated with Whisker Tough to prevent any short circuits from tin whiskers. Whisker Tough (TM), a polyurethane, is designed to implementable into the common manufacturing practices in the aerospace business.",

The phosphate based LiMPO4 (M = Fe, Mn, Ni, and Co), cathodes are found to be attractive because of the stable nature of the olivine-type structure.  Having a PO43&#8722; polyanion with a strong P\u2013O covalent bond provides not only excellent cycle-life but also a safe system that is resistant to overcharge, thermal degradation and oxygen evolution. This stability reduces the risk of failure propagation in the high energy and high power batteries of interest to the AirForce. The robust covalent bonding of PO43&#8722;, however, reduces the compounds\u2019 conductivities, and olivines require additional treatment with conductive aids to perform at useful rates.

This is cumbersome, requires multi-task energy in stress conditions and in Iraq and Afghanistan has resulted in warfighters choosing not to don ballistic protective eyewear under stress conditions (when the need for eye protection is the most acute) resulting in an increased incidence of eye injury.  The solution is a switchable technology that will allow the warfighter to wear only one set of protective eyewear in all light conditions resulting in decreased eye injury at lower overall cost to the Army as only one set of eyewear will be required. The EclipseVTS\u2122 (Variable Transmission System) offered by Eclipse Energy Systems, Inc., (Eclipse) is a solution.  In the Phase II effort, Eclipse will successfully transition from its Phase I prototype to a fully tested and approved spectacle prototype meeting all requirements including hearing protection and required electronics.

This prototype provides features for visualization of the program\u2019s call graph, tightly coupled with textual views of the source code, and features such as program slicing. It is capable of analyzing both C/C++ source code and modules written in assembly language.

        "abstract": "To address the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) need for a proactive dynamic accommodating prosthetic socket, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to complete the development of a new Liner and ElectroActive Polymer Prosthetic Socket (LEAPPS).  The system has a demonstrated capability to accommodate changes in the physiology of the wearer\u2019s residual limb and adjust to the soldier\u2019s changing stance by instantly providing softer/harder locations within the socket during ambulation or while in a fixed position (e.g., sitting).  Heat/moisture management is provided by a comfortable wicking liner that dissipates heat within the socket while also serving as moisture sensors to initiate peristaltic action driving  perspiration out of the system. A key technical breakthrough demonstrated by the LEAPPS system in Phase I is the ability of electroactive polymer (EAP) materials to change shape in response to automated control electronics and thus accommodate volume changes of a residual limb.  In Phase II, POC will integrate LEAPPS system components such as the EAP actuator/sensors, electronics controls/firmware, orientation/inertial sensor, and rechargeable power source within optimal locations of an actual prosthetic device to provide the ultimate fit responding directly to wearer\u2019s gait and posture regardless of activity level.",

        "abstract": "Use of explosives as weapons is not confined to the battlefield. Improvised explosive devices (IEDs) are increasingly being used by insurgents and terrorists worldwide against civilian targets because they are inexpensive, made from easily obtained materials, and wreak devastating havoc on the human body. During a bomb attack on civilian populations, all manner of responders, civilian and military, may be called upon, therefore all healthcare providers must be ready and able to effectively manage both scene and patient. To help provide this level of readiness, SimQuest has laid the preliminary groundwork for a simulation-based game that will accomplish the following objectives: (1) to train civilian and military prehospital care providers in the decisionmaking sequences needed for effective scene and patient management following an explosive blast, and (2) to provide enough repetition/practice to pre-train providers to proficiency in requisite treatment strategies. The goal is to augment existing combat medic tactical combat casualty care (TCCC) training using sim-game technologies to further improve the process of knowledge acquisition and decisionmaking for optimum performance following an explosive blast event. SimQuest will also integrate TCCC expertise with civilian training components, thus enhancing tactical EMS response to explosion-related, often mass casualty, incidents.",

Innovations include the use of semiconductor quantum cascade lasers (QCL) that operate in the terahertz region of the electromagnetic spectrum, a region rich in molecular signatures but under-utilized for spectral sensing. The Phase I work theoretically investigated the operational parameters and sensitivity limits of a THz ICLAS system, showing that it would be suitable for detection of vapors at ppb levels.  A THz QCL ICLAS system was bread-boarded and the major components of a complete ICLAS experimentally demonstrated.

In Phase I, selected III-V devices (HEMT and HBT) were used to demonstrate applicability of the CFDRC tools to characterization of SEEs. In Phase II, the simulation efficiency and accuracy will be improved by advancing numerical methods and physics models, and the modeling will be validated  against heavy-ion and pulsed-laser experiments.

However, the hearing ability of virtually all active-duty soldiers and trainees is currently assessed using existing audiology tools which rely primarily on standard auditory thresholds and do not take into account the specific nature of the task or environment.  In Phase II, Creare proposes to complete development and testing of a portable Functional Hearing Assessment System which will determine: (1) if an individual meets hearing-critical measures sufficient to be assigned to or remain in a particular job, and (2) if hearing aids or hearing protection affect hearing-related MOS requirements.  Our system includes several hearing tests including: speech intelligibility in noise; sound localization and detection; and automated thresholds with specific pass/fail criteria and tests tailored for each MOS.

Typical plasmonic/polaritonic materials for this frequency range are Ge/LiTaO3 nanospheres. Cholesteric LCs, which has an inherent chirality, will also be dispersed with binary or core-shell nanospheres.

The foundation of the QC-MM system is on interoperability and will be based on open standards and open-source solutions from the ground up.

A well-known technical barrier for composite rotor blade and wing section design is the lack of a user friendly, efficient and high-fidelity design tool to realistically represent the blade section at the conceptual level. This limitation prevents designers from accurately yet efficiently generating sectional properties, easily invoking comprehensive analyses, and rapidly and confidently predicting the stress distribution. As a result, aeromechanical analysis (e.g. for stability, loads, and vibration) is unfortunately left out of the conceptual design phase. In order to overcome this technical barrier and limitation, we propose to improve the functionalities of VABS (Variational Asymptotic Beam Section analysis), the best proven technology for realistic composite rotor blade analysis, and seamlessly integrate it with a versatile CAD environment, a robust optimizer, and a general-purpose postprocessor, all of which are specially tailored for blade and wing section design.

        "abstract": "Aeroelastic effects are significant design drivers in rotorcraft design. Typically, detailed structural information of the rotor blade necessary to determine its cross-sectional mass and stiffness properties is not available early on in the design process, especially for complex composite blades that are being employed in modern rotor systems. Therefore, high-fidelity aeroelastic analysis is usually not done until late in the rotorcraft design process, when changes to the design are difficult and costly to implement. Advatech Pacific proposes to address this shortcoming through the development of an integrated rotor blade design environment, where the blade cross sectional properties are calculated by the University of Michigan Variational Asymptotic Beam Sectional analysis code (UM/VABS). This approach combines the comparatively low run times of a beam structural analysis desired for a preliminary-level design tool with the high fidelity rotor blade cross sectional information typically associated with a 3D finite element approach. Overall rotorcraft design and blade aeromechanical analysis is provided by the Rotorcraft Comprehensive Analysis System (RCAS). The original developer of VABS, Dr. Carlos Cesnik, is part of the Advatech Team, bringing both his expertise and the latest version of the UM/VABS code to the project. In addition, Mr. Robert Loftus, currently a Technical Fellow at the Boeing Company (formerly McDonnell Douglas Helicopters) and IPT Lead for the new composite main rotor blade design and development for the AH-64D Apache Attack Helicopter, will be providing practical blade design expertise. The proposed design environment is flexible and modular, so that individual codes can be replaced without major software development effort. The development will be incremental in four major software builds and releases in Phase II. The primary piece of original software to be developed is IXGEN, the Intelligent Cross Section Generator. This is a suite of codes that let the user define a rotor blade or wing by its primary design features and their driving parameters. IXGEN translates this parametric information into a UM/VABS model for each cross section considered.",

        "abstract": "Without strong temporal and spatial separation guarantees provided by the underlying system, integrated mixed critical applications require verification and validation of all their hosted applications at the highest level of criticality. Since the early 1990s, time and space partitioning in commercial avionics has drastically reduced the certification burden on the lower-criticality applications. These systems, however, do not inherently support safe and secure operations in the presence of intentional and malicious threats. Furthermore, these custom real-time operating systems constrain application architecture options, so non-real-time applications pay a development and run-time penalty to operate in these environments. This effort will develop a Mixed Criticality, Assured, Real-Time (MiCART) hypervisor or virtual machine monitor (VMM) to enable the above integration benefits across more application domains than supported by current systems, while reducing the corresponding development, rehosting, verification and validation, and certification costs. By executing applications in MiCART guest partitions, they will be able to run in their current host environments, minimizing changes needed, with MiCART providing the necessary time and space partitioning among mixed criticality, multi-domain environments. In addition to real-time requirements, MiCART will support fault-tolerance, including fault detection, isolation, mitigation, and recovery.",

FMW, in collaboration with Honeywell Aerospace (aero engine original equipment manufacturer), proposed a nano-enhancement concept in Phase I and demonstrated the proof-of-concept via design trade studies, subscale article fabrication, and preliminary mechanical property evaluations. Nano-enhancement approach identified exceptional potential to meet the performance challenges in advanced turboshaft engine impellers. In Phase II, FMW-Honeywell team proposes to fully develop, optimize, scale-up, and mature the nano-enhanced titanium alloy impeller technology. A prototype impeller article, representative of the turboshaft engine, will be fabricated and machined into a fully-featured article for spin-pit testing. Manufacturability, machinability, and affordability aspects will be evaluated and risk reduction strategies will be developed. Detailed material characterization that includes microstructural quantifications, grain flow analysis, failure mechanisms, and microstructural variability analysis, will be conducted. Extensive testing on coupons extracted from various locations and orientations of the prototype article will be performed to generate material data under static and dynamic loading conditions at room and elevated temperatures relevant for the impeller.

During Phase I, the outline was developed for a comprehensive, multi-step algorithm to achieve this purpose called the Fast-Running Internal Damage Assessment Methodology (FRIDAM).  Also, the accuracy and run-times were significantly improved for single-degree-of-freedom analyses, which is a primary part of the FRIDAM methodology to determine structural component damage.

The FAA has responded by implementing two ground surveillance technologies at major U.S. airports to reduce the risk of runway incursions. However, both technologies route information through air traffic control (rather than directly to pilots), which significantly delays safe responses. Several flight deck technologies that communicate information directly to pilots are currently in development. However, there is a need for tools to rapidly test the flight deck technologies early in the design process and measure their impact on pilot performance prior to implementation. We propose to develop two tools that can be used together or independently to evaluate performance of flight deck technologies aimed at improving runway safety. We will deliver a computational cognitive model (Adaptive Control of Thought-Runway Safety; ACT-RS) that realistically emulates pilot performance, thus reducing the need for human pilots early in the design process.

Reliable and fast detection of hydrogen leaks is critical to both operational safety and maintenance of propellant quantities for in-space hydrogen systems. Characteristics of the plume formed by a hydrogen leak are unpredictable in low gravity due to lack of buoyancy effects. The proposed hydrogen fiber sensor can detect any flow direction of a hydrogen leak, determine the leak location, and measure hydrogen concentration. The fiber sensor can also detect hydrogen leaks from unexpected locations in space vehicles caused by stress-induced tiny cracks or other various damages. The proposed sensor will have the same fast response speed and high sensitivity in cryogenic environments as in room temperature. Furthermore, the proposed fiber sensor offers several significant advantages, including reconfigurable, lightweight, one feed-through, easy installation, easy maintenance, and capability of working in radiation harsh environments. In Phase 1, feasibility work has been performed. In Phase 2, prototypes of the proposed hydrogen fiber sensor will be produced for field trial and be prepared for commercialization in Phase 3.",

        "abstract": "ORBITEC proposes to continue the development of high-performance fuels to replace monomethyl hydrazine (MMH) and other storable fuels for in-space propulsion applications.  Compounds from various chemical families were proposed in Phase I to address these needs.  These families of compounds have greater heats of formation, lower volatility, and lower toxicity than MMH.  Their reduced vapor pressure provides greater safety in handling and less inhalation hazards than MMH.  MMH has very low exposure limits due to its toxicity, and is also a suspected carcinogen.  This increases the potential hazards during manufacture, transportation, storage, and operation of propulsion systems containing MMH-based fuels.  Therefore, a fuel formulation containing a high-energy density, less toxic, non-carcinogenic fuel with lower vapor pressure (reduced inhalation and handling hazards) can significantly reduce the complexity and cost of propulsion systems development and operations.  Phase II work will include additional fuel candidate synthesis and laboratory characterization, rocket performance evaluation in a lab-scale thrust chamber, fuel candidate down-select, plans for scale-up synthesis, and conceptual propulsion system designs that use the new fuel.  BENEFIT:   The end product of this overall research and development program will apply to satellite propulsion and station-keeping, military, civil, and commercial launch systems, as well as potential aerial warfare and tactical surface weapons. Near-term military applications include high-performance storable satellite propulsion including potential monopropellant applications, and high-performance liquid propulsion for target drones, cruise missiles, and other tactical systems.  Other applications for these propellants are foreseen that include the kill vehicles for such programs as Theater High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), NMD, Navy Upper Tier Theater Missile Defense (TMD) System, and the MEADS Air Defense System.

Furthermore, the Air Force is not facilitated to dynamically utilize real-time or historical information in its maintenance facilities for the improvement of test and repair. Current DoD test systems (based on test approaches developed in the 70\u2019s) have been designed to utilized fixed test strategies which drive throughput limitations, fidelity of test limitations and affect the time spent repairing Units Under Test (UUTs). These limitations are driving the cost of maintaining Air Force primary weapon systems and affecting their availability.

These capabilities will be enabled through use of historical data, real-time data, dynamic statistical entry point inference, modeling and diagnostic reasoners.

Approaches that are based on central or explicit control over the network introduce a single point of failure and  diminish the ability of the network to adapt. The phenomenon of self-organization is pervasive in nature, where biological organisms efficiently self-organize to carry out a wide diversity of functions, which enjoy desired properties of emergent behavior, scalability and optimality.

        "abstract": "The progress in reliable fuel cell technology will have a tremendous impact towards the development of a robust hydrogen economy. However, the requirement of high-purity hydrogen for fuel cell performance imposes a major technical barrier against the utilization of fuel cells in the DOD applications. In particular, hydrogen extracted from military logistical fuel (JP8) by reformers contains sulfur compounds, which ruin the catalyst and degrade the fuel cell performance. Therefore, an inexpensive and innovative method is needed to continuously monitor the process stream of military logistical fuel for sulfur and other impurities. Techno-Sciences, Inc. together with university partner Oklahoma State University proposes to develop a novel, low cost, nanoparticle surface plasmon resonance sensor capable of detecting part per billion trace levels of sulfur compounds present in the fuels utilized by hydrogen fuel cells. The sensor development employs a unique nanofabrication technique, \u201celectroless reduction of silver nanoparticles on silicon\u201d, combined with a novel sensing mechanism based on \u201chybrid plasmon damping\u201d. In Phase I, the validity of the approach has been demonstrated as a proof of concept by using bench top experimental set ups and analysis technologies. Phase II effort will address the prototype development for use in field conditions and technology integration with fuel cell industry.  BENEFIT:   The proposed effort will be applicable to a wide range of defense, commercial and residential end users. The initial effort will be particularly attractive to military and commercial power generation applications for contingency and mobile purposes. The sensor technology will be inexpensive, mobile and easily extensible to a wide variety of emerging sulfur detection problems for fuel cell based power systems. The commercial availability of the sensor will appeal to fuel cell industry, specifically, reformer manufacturers, fuel cell manufacturers, fuel cell end users as well as academic end users who work on development and optimization of future generation, more efficient fuel cell technologies. It is to be emphasized that low cost, trace level sulfur sensor is also applicable in the areas of gun powder detection, bio-hazard detection and threat detection, and has an environmental impact since the sulfur compounds in fossil fuels cause acid rains.",

Towed behind a research aircraft the CTV vehicle is capable of being lowered over the ocean and holding a desired altitude that is specified by the system user. The CTV is designed so that it flies below any wake turbulence produced by the main research aircraft, thus, providing ''clean'' air data samples.",

        "abstract": "The continuation of concept development and test of a water-based, advanced Phase Change Material (PCM) heat sink is proposed.  Utilizing a novel material choice for both an expansion diaphragm and the PCM case itself, the PCM can accommodate both the expansion of the freezing water-based material and very low temperature of approximately -250F.  The water-based PCM itself would be non-toxic and non-flammable, but additives will be included to preclude deterioration of wither the PCM container or the diaphragm material.  The use of a water-based PCM gives the highest heat capacity for the mass.  This is highly limited due to the needs for portability as required for an Extra-Vehicular Activity (EVA). The total heat capacity of an operational unit would be for 4 hour duration EVA use.  Through a logical progression of tasks including concept of operation formulation, requirements formulation, concept design reviews and detail design reviews that include design and thermal analysis using Thermal DesktopTM models, this effort can progress from the TRL 3 achieved in Phase I to TRL 4-5.  The team will continue development by designing a Variable Conductance Interface (VCI) for protecting water in the Liquid Cooling Garment (LCG) from freezing due to the temperature of the heat sink used by the PCM. The team will also develop system improvements identified during Phase I testing.  The PCM will be tested to confirm heat input/temperature performance and cycling capability. The test bed will allow for accurate heat input knowledge, temperature monitoring and cycling capability. The results will be compared to the thermal model to ensure accurate prediction capability for the next phase unit and system implementation. The design description and test results would form the basis of the final report.",

The tool will provide control over routers afloat and ashore to help manage and automate tasks, react to events, and schedule tasks, and become more autonomic over time. Currently the Navy has multiple communication paths from shore-to-ship and ship-to-ship but setup and management is not sufficiently dynamic. Multiple enclaves and paths to and from shore and ship use several RF paths with different characteristics. In this complex environment of dynamic changes, typically configurations are set and not changed. The Navy requires more dynamic changes to QoS, OSPF routing, PBR, ACL and other configurations to efficiently use the network resources to provide situational awareness and effective mission execution. This network management tool will be adaptable to ADNS Increment III and IV where there is more connectivity into more platforms, aircraft, and UAVs.

In Phase II SPEC anticipates working closely with the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Research Aviation Department (RAF) to develop a fully functional 3V-CPI data reduction and analysis software package that is universally applicable, and marketable to potential users of 3V-CPI and other cloud particle probes. All software codes written under the proposed funding will be open source and shared with the scientific community. All NCAR analysis code is also available to SPEC and other users, so any products NCAR contributes as we work together will also be available to the user community. Complete documentation will be available so that Navy scientists can use this software to process and analyze 3V-CPI data (including other particle probe data).

Over short time scales (e.g., milliseconds), these high-bandwidth links are plagued by scintillation fading due to atmospheric turbulence and (possibly) boundary layer effects (e.g., at the surface of fast moving aircraft in ship-air links). Although somewhat analogous to the mutlipath-induced fading that is familiar in mobile RF communications, optical scintillation-induced fades typically span thousands to millions of symbols \u2013 rather than tens to hundreds \u2013 due to the higher symbol rates and longer fade durations. Consequently, solutions for combating fading in RF links do not readily extend to Lasercomm. During Phase I, TrellisWare showed that a modern coded-protocol can offer dramatic throughput improvements over existing state-of-the-art baseband approaches in scintillation-induced fading FSO links. In Phase II, TrellisWare proposes to design and implement a hardware prototype that will demonstrate that our approach can be effectively and efficiently implemented for use on real maritime and expeditionary links. TrellisWare has already received interest from its FSO industry partners in the proposed hardware thus demonstrating a clear path to commercialization during Phase III and beyond.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Corrosion under multi-layer structures is a significant problem for the Air Force.  The ability to detect this corrosion rapidly over a large area is also very important.  The Magneto-Optic Imager (MOI) is an eddy current visualization tool that has been accepted in the market and has demonstrated the ability to rapidly inspect large areas.  The principle application of the MOI within the Air Force and the commercial airline market has been for first and second layer crack detection.  QUEST plans to develop a new version of the MOI that will detect corrosion and cracks buried deeper in multi-layer structures.  This new version will also provide enhanced visualization that will allow easier interpretation of the eddy current images resulting from corrosion.  This can also improve the POD capability of existing systems.  BENEFIT:  We anticipate the development of a new inspection tool optimized for detection of corrosion under multiple layers approaching 0.5 inch thick.   In addition to the military aircraft applications, similar problems exist within the commercial airline industry.  The technology also has application in the energy sector for detecting stress corrosion cracks in transport pipelines.  This is of significant interest from both a safety and a reliability perspective.",

The current method of designing, implementing and testing Human-Computer Interfaces (HCIs), and producing documentation for HCIs, requires coordinating the work of people with different skill sets and roles, using engineering tools that do not share their artifacts. The resulting inefficiencies provide opportunities for improvement that Harmonia\u2019s software lifecycle management (SLM) tools address. Our tools act as a central hub, coordinating many artifacts from all roles (system engineers, requirements analysts, cognitive engineers/human factors experts, software developers, testing experts, and technical documentation developers) that influence the HCI. The purpose of this project is to advance the state of SLM with an HCI component, and reduce system costs by reducing the technology insertion time and cost of any new capabilities the Navy adds to any platform that requires human decisions. Funding will be used to dramatically reduce the system cost by coordination and synchronization of artifacts produced at various stages of the software lifecycle. The funding will also be used to maximize warfighter performance by reducing cognitive load, and thus achieve optimal manning by permitting proper design and implementation of HCIs.",

During the Phase I effort, the initial T&E Ref Mod and the proof-of-concept TEMPL portal were demonstrated to show the effectiveness of TEMPL methodology and the benefits of collating legacy data and metadata, and of performing verification, validation, and completeness (VV&C) checks on metadata. The Phase II effort will significantly extend the Phase I results by developing a robust T&E Ref Mod and TEMPL methodology that is valid throughout DoD ranges, and supporting its standardization.  Additionally, the Phase I proof-of-concept TEMPL portal and VV&C capability will be extended in order to demonstrate the importance of metadata management.   BENEFIT:   Our solution will drastically mitigate the difficulties associated with achieving better understanding of T&E for both systems and system-of-systems.  The comprehensive T&E Ref Mod and the related validation, metadata abstraction, and visualization generation tools will result in significant reductions in time and effort needed to comprehensively define T&E metadata as well as order of magnitude efficiency and information quality gains.

Under the Phase II effort we will develop and demonstrate an SDR GPS-Lite application capable of providing a C/A code solution in the JTRS HMS Core Radio-1 using Network Assisted GPS (NAG) services to speed initialization. We shall also develop and demonstrate a GPS-Lite2 application that can generate a PPS solution in a JTRS-HMS radio using NAG services from a Server to deliver SAASM assistance and allow calculation of a PPS navigation solution without requiring crypto processing within the JTRS-HMS radio. This approach will support computation of a PPS solution for applications such as Unattended Ground Sensors (UGS) without requiring crypto equipment (such as is within a SAASM receiver) to be left unattended in the field. The Phase II design efforts will also provide material to support the development of a GPS security architecture that can result in integrating the GPS security processing within a JTRS crypto processor allowing a Type 1 JTRS radio platform to compute a PPS solution with or without NAG services.",

        "abstract": "Aero-assist technologies are used to control the velocity of exploration vehicles (EV) when entering earth or other planetary atmospheres. Since entry of EVs in planetary atmospheres results in significant heating, thermally stable aero-assist technologies are required to avoid the high heating rates while maintaining low mass. Polymer adhesives are used in aero-assist structures because of the need for high flexibility and good bonding between the different layers of polymer films or fabrics. However, current polymer adhesives cannot withstand temperatures above 400 C.  Therefore, polymer adhesives capable of withstanding high temperatures (> 400 C) are highly desirable for NASA applications. The present proposal, a collaborative effort between NEI Corporation and a NASA supplier of inflatable structures, aims to utilize our nanotechnology capabilities to address this need. The goal of this program is to develop high temperature adhesives that exhibit high thermal conductivity in addition to increased thermal decomposition temperature. Enhanced thermal conductivity will help to dissipate heat quickly and effectively to avoid temperature rise to harmful levels. This, together with increased thermal decomposition temperature, will enable the adhesives to sustain transient high temperature conditions. A key innovation of the program is to control the nanoparticle morphology so that enhanced thermal conductivity can be realized at relatively low nanoparticle loading levels. Building upon the Phase I proof of concept, the Phase II program will further develop the technology and implement it in NASA and commercial prototypes, thereby increasing the TRL to 4 or greater.",

The goal of the Phase II work is to develop a prototype of the generic handwritten Arabic-style script recognition system useable for screening Urdu documents such as personal letters for key terms and general subject matter. The proposed Phase II SBIR builds on a successful feasibility demonstration of a handwritten Urdu word recognition system carried out during the Phase I SBIR project.   The Phase I SBIR project has demonstrated the feasibility of building a generic recognition framework for non-Arabic languages using Arabic-style script based on the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) approach.  We developed and evaluated different types of feature extraction methods under the HMM recognition framework.  In particular, we have developed the novel Contourlet-based feature extraction algorithm to exploit the cursive nature of Arabic-style scripts. To further enhance the performance of the recognition system, more elaborate feature extraction approaches that integrates the Contourlet feature and Graph-based feature was also developed.  The script recognition system was evaluated using a handwritten Urdu database collected during Phase I. Experimental results show that both Contourlet-based feature extraction method and integrated Contourlet- and Graph-based feature extraction methods outperform the state-of-the-art baseline approaches. Based on the successful Phase I feasibility study, Phase II work will develop a prototype system that will be capable of recognizing personal letters written in Urdu.  Basic performance of the prototype system will be determined. The prototype system will serve as the baseline system for integrating with the software packages that is being developed under the Army\u2019s Sequoyah Machine Language Translation program.",

        "abstract": "The Phase II goal of the Low-temperature multi-spectral MEMS projector project is to demonstrate a working prototype of a 4-channel (MWIR and visible RGB) flickerless scene projector operating between -35C and 50C.  This multi-spectral projector is based the VLSI-membrane-mirror light modulator (VLSI-MMLM) technology which uses a membrane mirror to spatially modulate an off-chip light source.  The Phase II program will continue the membrane materials research with the aim of advancing the mostly-metal nitrocellulose membrane which showed promise in the Phase I.  The 4-channel architecture that was designed in the Phase I will be implemented using a TMA-optics design to better control stray light.  This Phase II will also focus on integrating the VLSI-MMLM into a Santa Barbara Infrared designed dewar.  The electronic interface to the VLSI-MMLM will also be updated to support 4-channel operation and to be fully compatible with the second-generation chip.   The overall technical goals of this program will be to develop a low-temperature multi-spectral scene projector with a a 2,000:1 contrast ratio, 500 x 500 pixels (1280 x 960 in a future commercial product), 120 Hz framing rate and flickerless operation with at least a 6\u00b0 field of view.   BENEFIT:   This research is expected to lead to a family of compact, low-cost, high-performance multi-spectral and infrared projectors that offer large temperature range, large numbers of pixels, high temperature resolution, and highly correlated dual-band spectral output.  Commercial applications of the technology include: (1) multi-spectral and infrared scene projectors for government and commercial testing applications (2) visible, mid-wave and long-wave infrared shutters, (3) spatial light modulators for optical signal processing and adaptive optics, (4) sensors and systems for industrial inspection, robotic vision and medical imaging, and (5) large-screen projection displays such as digital cinema.",

        "abstract": "Testing and clearing hypersonic systems is a challenging task. When anything unexpected occurs, the time to react is so short that the tested article must be destroyed. Because ground-based experimental facilities such as shock tunnels and arc-jets are typically unable to reproduce the flight conditions experienced by these systems, a fast multidisciplinary computational technology is required for assisting in their design, determining their stability and structural integrity throughout their flight phases and later assisting in their flight testing. This numerical simulation technology must account for the aerodynamics of the vehicle\u2019s shape and turbulence in its boundary layer, conduction in its structure, and radiation on its surface. It must also be capable of representing, when appropriate, ablative materials. Most importantly, it must account for the coupling between all of these physics fields. The main goal of this Phase II SBIR project is to develop such a computational technology by transforming the AERO Suite of Codes deployed at the Edwards Air Force Base into a state-of-the-art linear aerothermoelastic reduced-order modeling tool capable of assisting in the design and flight testing of hypersonic systems of relevance to the Air Force mission.   BENEFIT:   The success of this Phase II SBIR project will lead to a numerical simulation tool that is capable of addressing today''s pressing needs for reliable, accurate, and yet practical aerothermoelastic predictions. These predictions will assist not only the design and test of hypersonic systems, but also many mass-marketed \"hot\" mechanical engineering systems such as gas turbines and vehicle tires. Indeed, there is a strong interest in the simulation-based design of the gas flow in new generation turbine engines to mitigate excessive heat transfer from a turbulent flow to the airfoil blades, an effect that determines lifetime. Tire manufacturers are also strongly interested in the computational technology to be developed in this SBIR for the multidisciplinary thermal analysis of rolling aircraft and car tires. There is also a real need for such a technology for predicting coating flows in deformable equipment and heat transfer and thermal stresses in manifolds, brakes, fuel cells, and rotating machinery.",

        "abstract": "Impact Technologies, with cooperation from the University of Louisville and the Rochester Institute of Technology and with oversight from Goodrich Sensors and Integrated Systems, proposes an end to end wireless solution for aircraft tire and brake monitoring. The proposed system will serve to reduce safety risks and increase efficiency during flight and ground testing by providing wireless transmission of tire temperature, tire pressure, and brake temperature to a distance of at least 300 feet from the tires. The system will provide intelligent data fusion and diagnostic capability in support of automating the go / no go for test personnel to approach the aircraft. Key tasks of this Phase II effort include: 1) Development of a temperature patch technology to directly measure the hottest parts of the aircraft tire; 2) Development of local \u2018nodes\u2019 that read the temperature from the patches and transmit the data through a wireless mesh; and 3) Development of a controller computing module that receives and interprets data and provides a clear output to aid decision-making.  The system will be tested for EMI/EMC at Edwards prior to a final demonstration at the Landing Gear Test Facility at Wright-Patterson AFB.  BENEFIT:   Immediate benefits to the Air Force would be recognized in the form of reduced safety risks and increased flight and ground test efficiency. Overheated brakes pose the risk of fire, and incorrect tire pressure or overheated tires increases the risk of a blowout. Long range transmission of critical tire and brake data means personnel need not approach the aircraft to check tire and brake condition, reducing personnel safety risks.  There is significant commercialization potential for this technology in the military and commercial arenas. The largest potential would be development of a system for permanent on-aircraft installation to provide vital information about brake and tire condition in real time.  In addition, the fundamental harsh environment wireless temperature and pressure measurement and transmission technologies developed in the project will have a variety of applications across multiple machinery and vehicle types for enabling advanced condition monitoring and prognostics.",

        "abstract": "Our SBIR Phase I effort has focused on formulating an innovative design for the multicast admission control architecture (McastAC) that considers novel approaches for implementing a red side network mechanism to provide end-to-end QoS assurance.   The McastAC  follows an edge-based admission control architecture that is naturally compatible with tree-based multicast routing, such as Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) routing protocols and its functionality is largely independent of whether the intermediate network is homogeneous or whether it comprises a single or multiple routing/radio domains (or autonomous systems). McastAC employs content filtering, where the admission/rejection decisions are based on utility and proximity, as well as Multicast multistreaming that maximizes the network utilization and adapts the stream quality to the clients\u2019 capabilities and network conditions.  In Phase II, we will develop a detailed specification of the Multicast Admission Decision (MAD) Logic for various operations scenarios.  We will also design and verify the network resource performance estimation (NRPE) flow correlation procedure that provides critical inputs to MAD logic and study distributed techniques such as sharing information of local flows with network peers to enhance estimation accuracy. We will iteratively vet the design using a combination of simulation and modeling, emulation, and testbed experiments.",

        "abstract": "Ground Moving Target Indicator (GMTI) radar provides an all-weather day-night capability to detect moving targets and provide robust persistent day-night surveillance of regions of interest. While these radar systems are designed to detect moving vehicles and human beings, they typically also produce a large number of false alarms due to clutter and wildlife. These false alarms can be expensive in terms of time and resources required to prosecute the false tracks, resulting in an ineffective system. In addition to the cost of investigating false alarms, an additional consequence is that if too many false alarms are reported, the operators will begin to ignore the target reports resulting in an ineffective system. The specific focus of the proposed effort is the automatic extraction of intelligence about enemy movement patterns or lines of communication from GMTI detection data. This is particularly challenging when the sensor output data contains a large number of false alarms. Under the proposed effort ISL will provide the Army with a capability to automatically extract information about enemy lines of communication from GMIT sensor data.",

        "abstract": "A wide variety of unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) carrying various sensors are increasingly deployed on today\u2019s battlefield for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) missions. These UAV platforms provide a wealth of ISR data mainly captured with video sensors. These video sensors provide considerable amounts of data for exploitation, suitable for various types of assisted and autonomous processing including target recognition, tracking, contextual scene analysis, aimpoint generation, forensic analysis, and behavioral characterization. Generally the smaller UAVs do not have existing sensor models and sensor pointing direction may not be well known. These limitations make associating accurate position information with the full motion video (FMV) difficult using current techniques. ISL is proposing to upgrade the Precision Georegistration and Targeting Application (PGTA) developed under a Navy sponsored Phase II SBIR to automatically produce georegistered FMV in real-time. The FMV is not required to have an associated sensor model. Georegistered FMV will have a three-dimensional geoposition coordinate (latitude, longitude, and elevation) associated with every pixel of the video as well as an estimate of the circular error (CE) and linear error (LE). The georegistered FMV application will provide for timely exploitation of the surveillance data for tactical strike planning and intelligence applications.",

MAI proposes in Phase II of MADPT, to develop a prototype database tool that focuses on limited taxa of marine species and geographic area. To accomplish this goal, MAI will identify viable selected external databases for population of the MADPT prototype.

If measurement of key landing parameters (tire temperature, brake stack temperature and tire pressure) were automated, it would allow both increased levels of safety when approaching the aircraft, and better optimized testing schedules. Technologies exist to provide such measurements, but both lack sufficient range to reduce risk, and has not been designed to function and survive in the extreme conditions necessary for testing of military aircraft. Templeman Automation''s Wireless Tire and Brake Monitoring System will provide measurement of key landing parameters and meet military aircraft testing needs.",

The system must support multiple sensing modalities including acoustic, seismic and IR.  In this Phase II research, we will complete the development of: (a) new sensor-level hardware/software to provide flexible and configurable data sampling and synchronization, and offer adequate on-board processing and storage capabilities for low-level collaborative signal processing and high fidelity data acquisition; (b) network-level solutions that account for network connectivity and sensor/network health and supports various routing strategies and adoption of user-defined optimum sensor collaboration and data fusion applications; and (c) system console that allows the developers to select and upload their application-specific tasks via a user-friendly interface. The user can choose several possible modes of operation to examine various factors such reliability, bandwidth and timeliness of data.    This research will lead to the development and prototyping of a low-cost WSN development-solution using available ZigBee-based COTS hardware.

These UAV platforms provide a wealth of ISR data mainly captured with video sensors. These video sensors provide considerable amounts of data for exploitation, suitable for various types of assisted and autonomous processing including target recognition, tracking, contextual scene analysis, aimpoint generation, forensic analysis, and behavioral characterization. Generally the smaller UAVs do not have existing sensor models and sensor pointing direction may not be well known. These limitations make associating accurate position information with the full motion video (FMV) difficult using current techniques. ISL is proposing to upgrade the Precision Georegistration and Targeting Application (PGTA) developed under a Navy sponsored Phase II SBIR to automatically produce georegistered FMV in real-time. The FMV is not required to have an associated sensor model. Georegistered FMV will have a three-dimensional geoposition coordinate (latitude, longitude, and elevation) associated with every pixel of the video as well as an estimate of the circular error (CE) and linear error (LE). The georegistered FMV application will provide for timely exploitation of the surveillance data for tactical strike planning and intelligence applications.",

This effort will combine our unique expertise in instrumented-Hot Isostatic Pressing (HIP) with new approaches in powder blend design to develop a new generation of cost-efficient, high strength and highly reactive materials.  The proposed material system will have a blend of three elemental and compound powders.  The powder blend will be consolidated to full density to maximize the mechanical properties, and below the reaction temperature to preserve the energy for release upon demand.

MATSYS high instrumented-HIP will enable rapid characterization of densification of powder mixtures and optimization of mixtures of interest.

The current detection method for TTHM determination involves sending samples to EPA certified laboratories for gas chromatography analysis; a method that is both expensive and time consuming.  In the Phase I, Agave BioSystems demonstrated proof of concept for a sensitive colorimetric TTHM detection system based on a modified Fujiwara reaction, which can be integrated into a portable field sensor.  This assay system utilizes a modified Fujiwara reaction to yield a detectable color product that correlates directly to the TTHM levels of the water sample.  In this Phase II, Agave BioSystems proposes to construct a compact and portable rapid response TTHM water monitoring system for field use.   BENEFIT:   TTHM is linked to increased rates of bladder and colorectal cancers, and several studies link TTHM to heart, liver, and central nervous system damage. The EPA estimates that lowering TTHM levels in as few as 1,200 small drinking water systems could prevent up to 20 cases of bladder cancer per year, resulting in economic benefits of up to $110 million per year.  Another documented health risk is the increased rate of miscarriage and congenital birth defects in areas with high TTHM levels. A Virginia based class action lawsuit seeking more than $1 billion in damages, claims that peak TTHM occurrences in one water distribution system may have led to multiple miscarriages. A cost effective and easy to use field portable sensor, such as the one proposed by Agave BioSystems, would enable drinking water delivery systems of any size to effectively monitor the levels of TTHM in their water supply on a more frequent basis, and allow proactively treating TTHM levels before they are a health threat.",

        "abstract": "Clear Science Corp. proposes to develop Aeroelastic Model Updating (AMU) software that enables safer, more efficient and accurate flutter testing of military aircraft.  Aircraft certification involves a battery of expensive and sometimes risky flight tests.  The proposed tool will reduce costs by reducing required hours of flutter testing and will reduce risk by providing supplemental aeroelastic-response data to test personnel prior to and during flight tests.  The software consists of low-dimensional, computationally efficient models that predict aeroelastic responses in aircraft during flight tests and that can be calibrated or updated with flight data as they become available.  The computational efficiency of the reduced-order models facilitates the required quick turnaround of predictions that is not possible with high-dimensional aeroelastic models. Phase I applied the method in predicting aeroelastic responses of an AGARD 445.6 wing, demonstrating the technical merit and feasibility of the approach.  Phase II will transition the technology to applications involving full aircraft configurations with large, computationally intensive simulations and large numbers of aeroelastic modes.  Using the software to fuse data from multiple sources will facilitate more informed decisions during the aircraft certification  process, will lower program costs, and will reduce risk to pilots and aircraft.  BENEFIT:   The commercial product that Clear Science Corp will develop is a computational toolbox for modeling aeroelastic responses in flight vehicles and using data from different sources to update and calibrate the models. The software is designed to enhance and streamline flight certification testing required in military aircraft by providing model predictions in real time during tests.   Potential military applications range from fixed-wing aircraft to rotorcraft, munitions, and next-generation air platforms like micro-air vehicles.  The design process relies on a mixture of laboratory testing, computational modeling, and final performance evaluations in a variety of products.  The proposed software is designed to accommodate data from both simulations and field tests in a range of engineering problems with the intent of maximizing marketability.  Potential uses extend from aeroelasticity analyses to CFD-based aerodynamic, aerothermodynamic, and aero-acoustic analyses and beyond to a host of engineering disciplines in and outside the aerospace industry.  The primary pool of potential customers consists of DoD agencies, NASA, US government contractors, and commercial businesses that develop, design, and test products involving fluid-structure interaction as it relates to efficient and safe operation.

Phase I work conclusively demonstrated BENDER\u2019s feasibility through design, fabrication, and testing of a TRL 4 prototype. Specifically, development of the core operational software, evaluation of processor instruction set architecture (ISA) extensions, and network and processing element design were addressed. Using typical parallelizable algorithms, such as 2D fast Fourier transfers (FFTs), the system was proven capable of executing an FFT in parallel, far exceeding the Phase I goal of simulating this capability. In Phase II, POC will finalize a system-on-a-chip design suitable for transition to a foundry for fabrication. This will target development of a Phase II architecture (patterned closely on the Phase I design) suitable for transition to a chip-scale device. The Phase II BENDER will provide ultra-low-power operation and on-the-fly (",

        "abstract": "Current state-of-the-art X-ray imaging detectors use energy integration, where the simple integration of X-ray events during the exposure period forms images.  Unfortunately, such indiscriminate operation is sub-optimal for digital radiography or CT imaging because of its inability to reject scatter, thus reducing contrast in reconstructed images, and the limited resolution of the detectors, which results in image blurring.  These deleterious effects are particularly problematic for high-energy X-ray inspection systems for munitions, where important small-scale defects on the order of 100 to 250 microns are easily obscured due to the prevalent scattering.  However, a new generation of X-ray detector to be developed during Phase II is expected to have photon counting and energy recording ability, even when incident flux is very high.  The use of such detectors will improve resolution and contrast in images, while significantly enhancing their signal-to-noise ratio, and assist in identifying material compositions.  Our Phase I research successfully demonstrated the feasibility of developing such a detector based on a semiconductor X-ray sensor coupled to a novel digital pixel sensor readout.  For X-ray energies typically used in inspection systems, this detector would provide high efficiency, high resolution, and photon counting capability with at least five levels of energy discrimination.",

This active magnetic shielding should significantly improve the fidelity and performance of superconductor electronic systems as well as reduce the system cost and weight.",

        "abstract": "The airborne tactical environment presents a number of challenges for waveform design. High dynamics and multipath at the physical layer and heterogeneous link conditions at the network layer dictate the use of a modern waveform with intelligent networking capability. In Phase-I, TrellisWare developed a modern communication waveform that brings together TrellisWare''s advanced flexible forward-error-correction (FEC) technology and the energy-efficient continuous-phase modulation (CPM) to deliver robust broadband throughput over tactical air-to-ground links. With state-of-the-art physical layer receiver processing technologies Per-Survivor Processing (PSP) and Adaptive Iterative Detection (AID) the proposed waveform effectively combats severe multipath and extreme platform dynamics at the same time, while delivering data rates over 1.3 Mbps with a single 1.2 MHz- bandwidth channel and over 5 Mbps using multicarrier signaling. Developed with the current software-defined radio (SDR) constraints in mind, the proposed waveform is an excellent candidate for delivering robust broadband performance universally across different tactical platforms. TrellisWare\u2019s Phase II effort is focused on demonstrating that the flexibility provided by the Phase I approach can be leveraged to retrofit enhanced PHY capability into existing waveforms. This approach if proven can dramatically reduce waveform development costs by enabling significant reuse of the waveform cost drivers (MAC/Networking Software).",

        "abstract": "The very high-resolution V Corp analog-to-digital converter with Adaptive Signal Cancellation (ASC) uses a two or more stages of high-speed, high-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) with blind adaptive interstage matching to successively cancel large signals from the analog input and thereby allow very wide dynamic range digitization of the lower level signals. Conventional pipelined subranging ADC architectures without V Corp\u2019s proprietary ASC signal processing suffer from transfer function discontinuities due to gain, phase, and DC-offset mismatches between the multiple ADCs. These discontinuities introduce nonlinear distortion that severely limits the usable Spurious Free Dynamic Range (SFDR). The ADCs must be matched extremely accurately to enable high-resolution performance, which is very difficult to accomplish because the mismatches are a function of input frequency, amplitude, sample rate, and even small temperature changes. The key to the efficacy of the Adaptive Signal Cancellation architecture is the ability for the processing to calibrate itself in the background to insure optimal dynamic range by cancelling large signals. This technology provides significantly higher dynamic range than state-of-the-art ADCs: approximately 36 dB improvement in dynamic range compared to current 8-bit and 10-bit 1.2 GSPS ADCs, and three times the bandwidth of current 12-bit, 400 MSPS ADCs. The extremely high spur free dynamic range that the architecture provides allows the accurate detection of very small signals in an environment with high-power interference which significantly reduces co-site inference issues. The architecture (including multiple ADCs, DACs, support electronics and adaptive processing) can be implemented in a compact, low-power custom ASIC or a printed-circuit board with discrete components and an FPGA. A 12-bit, 1.2 GSPS A/D converter can be realized in a compact package using currently-available commercial off-the-shelf parts. This represents \u201ctrue\u201d 12-bit dynamic range (i.e., SFDR > 85 dB), which allows the accurate detection of small signals in the presence of simultaneous very large level signals. It provides direct RF conversion up to 1.2 GHz. This approach can be customized for different bandwidth and dynamic range requirements by selecting different base ADC and DAC chips and/or using more stages of A/D conversion in the architecture and, as a core technology, is widely applicable to numerous projects. The ASC approach is also suitable for use with superconducting ADCs and DACs and provides a direct path to SFDR > 130 dB with direct RF conversion over several GHz of bandwidth. During Phase II, the architecture will be demonstrated using real-time hardware data. General Dynamics has committed to being a Phase II partner with V Corp on this project and, once successfully demonstrated, is very interested in being a Phase III transition partner.",

        "abstract": "Early indication of impending main engine bearing failure is critical, especially for single engine fighter aircraft such as the F16.  Bearing degradation leading to failure is characterized by increasing amounts of bearing spall debris entering the engine lubricant flow.  Magnetic chip collectors are widely fielded to capture anomalous debris, but typically suffer low capture efficiency and lack online measurement capability.  Aircraft engine lubrication filters, however, capture virtually all bearing damage particulates, making them well suited to perform a secondary role as debris monitoring sensing elements.  To address the critical need for improved engine diagnostic capabilities, Luna Innovations is advancing the state of the art in filter monitoring by leveraging the technical experience of industry leaders to develop load sensing hardware and trending algorithms for particulate distributions specific to aircraft engine bearing damage.  In Phase I, the team demonstrated filter loading sensitivity to less than five milligrams of bearing spall debris, and implemented methods for passively correcting the measurement for flow rate and thermal effects. The Phase II program will focus on tailoring filter construction to optimize sensitivity to bearing spall debris and developing an integrated hardware package suitable for evaluation on ground-based test stands.  BENEFIT:   Successful implementation of the proposed technology will provide aircraft operators and maintainers with critical information regarding the state of the main bearings as well as remaining filter life and important lubricant properties.  In addition to the clear benefits of such a system for DoD aircraft engines, potential commercial application for this technology is broad.  Any sizable, expensive, and/or critical mechanical system that requires lubricant circulation is certain to employ filtration to mitigate abrasive wear of the components, including power generation rotating equipment, commercial aviation hydraulic and engine lubrication systems, and large truck engines.   The advanced oil filter load monitoring system developed under the proposed program would be directly applicable to those systems where the anticipated failure modes involve significant debris generation within the fluid circulation system.  The diagnostic information provided by the system would enhance condition-based maintenance strategies, reducing ownership costs over the life of the equipment. A key enabling benefit of this technology is that the necessary hardware is readily installed using existing fluid connections and is minimally invasive, limited to the original oil filter location.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  This proposal seeks to advance Composite Defect Resonance Imaging by Vibration Excitation (CDRIVE) based on development of an automated data processing framework for integration with a newly developed high-speed Matrix Laser Vibrometer (MLV). The MLV, developed under an earlier program, provides, for the first time, an instrument for instant capture of 2D velocity images which depict the full-field temporal evolution of structural vibrations. The capabilities of the MLV, together with the interdependence of the excitation and signal processing strategy is critical to the overall CDRIVE methodology. While the MLV offers a unique hardware platform for CDRIVE, its future success depends upon development of systematic strategy aimed at defect detection with high probability and low false alarm rates. This proposal includes a comparative study which aims to establish these requirements based on a determination of the current scope of application, identification of the major technical limitations and, where possible, implementation of hardware and/or analytical solutions which address these limitations. A further goal of this proposal is to determine to what extent existing strategies or analyses may be adapted and incorporated to extend the current detection capabilities of CDRIVE. The results of this effort will be integrated under a CDRIVE operating system configured, as far as possible, for autonomous data collection, processing and review.  BENEFIT:  The NDI system, together with the core MLV technology developed under this program, represents an innovative development which will enhance the practicality of LDV for structural analysis. Numerous industries (automotive, aerospace, medical, musical instruments, and computer electronics) employ LDV for modal vibration analyses and structural diagnostics. In addition to modal analysis, the MLV would target the market represented by nondestructive testing in the marine, aviation and space industries and, in particular, the nondestructive inspection in manufacture and maintenance of deployed military vessels. Many types of military conventional and composite structures and vehicles can benefit from a systematic method to test for damage over large areas. The potential market is substantial. For example, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) estimated that the overall cost of damage detection and repair in the United States is 4.2% of the Gross National Product (GNP) or $290 billion in 1996. It is estimated that damage costs are $4 billion annually for military aircraft systems and $9 billion annually for commercial and private aircraft. The proposed MLV can also be used as a diagnostic tool for civil engineering and aging structures requiring inspection of bridges, oil, gas or water tanks, as well as walls of a building affected by catastrophic events (earthquake, tornado, etc.).",

        "abstract": "Orbital Research proposes to design, optimize and demonstrate a light-weight swashplateless helicopter rotor collective control system.  Swashplateless rotors are desirable for reasons including increased rotorcraft top speed, reduced vibration, reduced vehicle mass, and reduced rotorhead maintenance.  Swashplateless rotor systems utilize on-blade controls (OBC) or individual blade controls (IBC) to adjust the lift created by each rotor blade.  However, a limitation of OBC and IBC is that utilizing the OBC/IBC lift authority for collective blade control diminishes the range available for cyclic blade control.  Collective control systems that primarily adjust the root blade incidence angle gives increased lift without reducing the authority of the OBC/IBC.   To provide reduced complexity and weight, Orbital Research will utilize all-electric, redundant, zero-backlash actuators to drive a single mechanism capable of increasing the root blade incidence.  Because the actuators consist of DC motors and a low-volume, high-gear-ratio transmission, the proposed actuators will be extremely reliable.  If an actuator fails, the transmission is individually disconnectable, allowing for redundancy to be incorporated into the swashplateless rotor design.  Hence, the rotorcraft can maintain normal flight with 2 actuator failures.  The resulting design, while aimed at manned single rotor helicopters, will be scalable to a range of rotorcraft including UAVs.",

        "abstract": "Aircraft research, development, and testing programs require high-fidelity simulations and aerodynamic models. However, once flight testing begins the process of updating the simulation to match flight-test results is often ad hoc, labor intensive, and costly. Recent research is investigating data-driven methods for automated and semi-automated updating simulation databases and Phase I efforts built upon this research to address the unique challenges associated with updating tiltrotor simulations. In Phase I the authors demonstrated how one can learn a suitably complex tiltrotor model based on the underlying simulation aerodynamics and then search for additional structure (if required) using flight, or other external, data. Additional structure is only suggested if certain information-theoretic criteria are satisfied. Estimation theory is used to calculate optimal parameter estimates of the defined model structure. In Phase II, the authors will extend the tiltrotor approaches to rotorcraft in general, demonstrate the approach for an expanded set of operating conditions, build a suite of simulation-updating tools, and use these tools to develop and update a high-fidelity tiltrotor simulation using measured flight-test data. The suite of simulation-updating tools includes all steps in the update process from data preprocessing to blending the update with the existing database.",

        "abstract": "A secure communications network is sought for use in a plant environment such as Air Force\u0081fs Arnold Engineering Design Center (AEDC) or the Oklahoma City Air Logistics Center (OC-ALC). Many test results conducted at these facilities are classified, so it requires very secure voice and data communications network system. The proposed system shall consist of a set of small, wearable communication devices which interface with way stations located throughout the plant. The proposed system will have the following characteristics: 1) The network should work in a environment with high levels of ambient noise, EMI interference, RF dead zones, grease, dirt, water, and other contaminants. 2) The system must transmit data in a secure manner which is nearly impossible to either intercept or decode. 3) The system should identify and locate individuals wearing communicators within user-defined areas. 4) The system should provide the capability to translate voice to text and record a text-based log to a PC. IAI will develop a set of Wi-Fi-based prototype systems during Phase II to allow AEDC to test and evaluate all functionalities, including noise cancelling voice recognition, VoIP, network security, hands free operations, sensor data logging, issue logging, location tracking, etc., in a relevant environment.    BENEFIT:   Commercial Potential: The proposed technology has many applications in factories of heavy industries (such as shipbuilding, mining, industrial machinery), chemical plants, electrical stations, and other industries. Department of Homeland Security is very concern about safety of power plants, dams, facility plants and other potential targets such as chemical plants, industrial facilities.  Wireless communications for these facilities require better security than normal networks.   Military applications: Many military facilities experience strong RF interferences and loud noises. Two government facility of this nature are Air Force\u0081fs Arnold Engineering Design Center (AEDC) and the Oklahoma City Air Logistics Center (OC-ALC). Many test results conducted at these places are classified, so it is very desirable to use secure voice and data wireless communications network system.

        "abstract": "Physical Sciences Inc. (PSI) proposes to develop a signal processing system to facilitate real-time detection of chemical and biological threats via analysis of hyperspectral infrared imagery produced by portable imaging spectrometers.  The processor will support simultaneous detection of up to 16 different target materials using a spectral-matching-based detection algorithm.  For datacubes acquired in band-sequential order, the processor will also support real-time image registration to facilitate on-the-move detection from vehicles and aircraft.  Target detection decisions will be based on a likelihood ratio test which follows from a parameterized representation of the radiative transfer equation and a parameterized statistical model for background variability.  In contrast to adaptive-subspace-based and matched-filter-based target detection, the proposed detection algorithm is not constrained by the presumption of a linear additive signal model or Gaussian noise statistics.  Relaxation of these constraints yields superior Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curves relative to adaptive-subspace-based and matched-filter-based detection.",

A large percentage of Soldiers with TBI exhibits significant communication impairments, often in the absence of hearing loss. These individuals suffer from auditory processing deficits and are more likely to benefit from a cognitive training program than from hearing aids, creating a need for a training tool that would rehabilitate their communication abilities. In this project, Aptima will develop an innovative rehabilitation technology - AGATE - that will provide adaptive cognitive and metacognitive training in order to improve the ability for blast casualties and TBI victims to communicate. This game-based training system will consist of a variety of engaging events, incorporating auditory and visual components, designed to provide tailored content and feedback based on user characteristics and performance.

The ability to organically eliminate the threat of an enemy UAV would significantly enhance our soldier\u2019s ability to stay covert and improve the mission\u2019s operational timeline.  Adding a lethal attack capability to existing Small and Micro Air Vehicles would provide this organic capability to our Special Forces.

Ultimately, behaviors will be expanded to allow collision avoidance of multiple vessels in harbor environments with complex shorelines and controlled channels. Objectives of the Phase II effort include expanding the MOOS robotic architecture with additional a priori data modules, integrating planning and sensed obstacle management from other Navy efforts, and enhancing existing behaviors for complex environments and multiple-vessel interactions. Key to this program is SARA\u2019s behavior development path and our access to in-water vessels for testing. During Phase I, a framework for developing behaviors was established that rapidly translates conceptual behavior solutions into simulation and finally into iterative improvement through field testing. Regular field testing is facilitated by SARA\u2019s fleet of kayak-based USVs and access to testing locations.

        "abstract": "Flutter is a potentially explosive phenomenon that results from the simultaneous interaction of aerodynamic, structural, and inertial forces. The nature of flutter mandates that flight testing be cautious and conservative. In addition to the flutter instability, adverse aeroelastic phenomena include limit cycle oscillations, buffeting, buzz, and undesirable gust response. The analytical prediction of aeroelastic phenomena in the transonic regime has historically been troublesome and requires high fidelity simulation models to obtain accurate predictions. The models are, however, computationally expensive. Traditional uncertainty analysis is therefore not often applied to flutter prediction. The proposed work is to develop computationally efficient methods that reduce the existing computational time limitations of traditional uncertainty analysis. Building upon the successful Phase I demonstration, the coupling of Design of Experiments and Response Surface Methods and the application of robust stability techniques, namely \u0083\u00dd-analysis, will be combined into a comprehensive software toolbox: STI-Aeroservoelastic Robustness Toolbox. STI-ART will have the flexibility to use computational unsteady aerodynamic and structural finite element models from a variety of sources, ranging from simple potential flow models (e.g., doublet lattice methods) and linear structural models to solutions based on modeling of the full Navier Stokes equations and non-linear structural models with many elements.",

They are a key element in the design and certification of turbine engines including the F100, F119, and F135. Critical to this approach is the characterization of structural materials and development of life prediction methodologies and then application of these to component design, validation and assessment. In addition, mission cycles for hot section components such as turbine airfoils are quite complex and test methodologies such as strain- controlled TMF have not been sufficiently standardized and matured to provide repeatable results across a broad range of facilities and environments. This challenge is exacerbated by the complex loading profiles these components experience. This can lead to loss of durability in key hot section components. The demonstrated success of the Phase I effort, together with the anticipated results from the Phase I Option, will drive the development of a next-generation TMF testing approach in Phase II that is intended to directly address the key technical issues TMF testing demands, and to significantly impact the cost of testing by reducing test setup time, and reducing cumulative rig time.",

        "abstract": "This proposal presents an innovative low power and high performance transceiver (TR) microwave monolithic integrated circuit (MMIC) for a 15.7~17.7 GHz Ku-band (or 10~12 GHz X-band) Radar-On-Chip (ROC) applications. The radar TR MMIC utilizes phase-array architecture for improved directivity. The radar TR MMIC includes a low noise front-end with low noise amplifier (LNA) and mixer. The TR MMIC is featured with 12bit low-power analog-to-digital-converters (ADC) with programmable sample rate of 40~120MHz and input bandwidth 10~30MHz. The TR MMIC also includes a high-speed low-power direct-digital-synthesizer (DDS) with programmable clock frequency up to 2 GHz.  The DDS further includes a 24-bit phase accumulator and a 10-bit sinusoidal-weighted digital-to-analog-converter (DAC) to achieve better than 50dBc spurious-free-dynamic-range (SFDR).  The DDS also includes a chirp modulator to allow stretch procession that relaxes the input-bandwidth requirement for the ADCs.  The TR MMIC uses a low-noise phase-locked-loop (PLL) to generate both the ADC/DDS clocks and the multi-phase local-oscillator (LO) signals for phase array transmission. The TR module has a power amplifier (PA) driver with innovative bias boosting scheme to drive off-chip PAs. The proposed SiGe TR MMIC can achieve low power consumption of less than 6W for Ku-band and X-band radar applications.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this Phase-II research effort is to build and deliver a fully operational fiber-coupled picosecond (ps) laser-based CARS system for measuring gas-phase temperature in reacting flows.  The proposed fiber-based CARS system will also be fully capable of nanosecond operation with the addition of a nanosecond pump laser provided by the customer.  It will be tested in laboratory hydrocarbon-air flames followed by evaluation in an augmentor test-rig at WPAFB, OH.  These measurements will allow optimizing the CARS system in preparation for measurements in the AEDC J85 test rig.  During the Phase-II research effort, we will build on successful Phase I studies of fiber-optic beam propagation and focus our attention on pulsed-laser propagation through solid- and hollow-core photonic crystal fibers.  The CARS system will be built in such a way so as to incorporate both multimode step-index fibers and photonic crystal fibers.  The unique feature of the ps-CARS technique for fiber delivery is that it requires two orders of magnitude less energy per laser pulse compared to the conventional nanosecond CARS and affords an improvement in damage threshold.  We will also design and build a special collimator to facilitate raster scanning with the fiber-based CARS system.  This fiber collimator will allow two- or three-dimensional scanning of the flow field.  The proposed research effort will provide new diagnostic capabilities that will enable the Air Force and gas-turbine system manufacturers to address the challenges associated with high-speed reacting and non-reacting flows.  BENEFIT:   The proposed research effort will provide new diagnostic capabilities that will enable the Air Force and gas-turbine system manufacturers to address the challenges associated with high-speed reacting and non-reacting flows. These tools are critical for the development and long-term health of propulsion systems for high-performance military as well as commercial systems.  The proposed research will also help to advance the state of fiber technology for optical diagnostics through numerical modeling of light propagation through the optical fibers.  Quantitative measurements are critical for validating numerical models of reacting and non-equilibrium phenomena affecting modern gas-turbine and hypersonic propulsion systems.  Such experimental and numerical tools will prove to be extremely valuable in the analysis of military and commercial gas-turbine combustors, as well as applications with limited optical access such as internal combustion engines and stationary power generation systems.",

        "abstract": "Stream processors form a new class of architectures that offers performance scalable to TeraOPS on a single chip, have cost and power efficiency comparable to ASICs, and are completely software programmable from high-level languages. Stream processor technology was developed over 8 years from 1997-2004 of DARPA-funded research on the Imagine project at Stanford University that resulted in a working prototype IC, software tools, application software, and evaluation board. This technology provides a 4-20x improvement in GOPS and GOPS/Watt compared to other leading commercially-available software-programmable DSPs and multi-core processors. As this architecture is scaled to smaller CMOS technologies, it will be feasible to integrate 100s to 1000s of ALUs on a single chip, providing TeraOPS of performance. In this proposal, we will develop an architecture, set of software tools, and application libraries for a 64-lane TeraOPS stream processor named Amazon.

        "abstract": "Nerve agents (NA) such as sarin, soman, tabun or VX are organophosphate compounds similar to those used as pesticides but with much higher toxicity that can cause death within minutes. Use of NA weapons of mass destruction has become a real threat since the Iraq\u2013Iran war in the 1980s and the sarin attacks against civilians in Japan in 1994 and 1995. Nerve agents are relatively simple and inexpensive to produce, transport, and deploy and are the most toxic of the known chemical warfare agents. Therefore, there is an increasing threat of their use for terrorist purposes against military and civilian populations. This calls for effective preventive and therapeutic preparedness. Currently available antidotes are not very effective. We propose to develop adaptazymes (catalytic oligonucleotides) that would hydrolyze soman and other NAs and organophosphates. We will partner with Battelle, Texas A&M University and Archemix to develop and market our adaptazyme technology. Such adaptazymes would find commercial application in preventive and therapeutic treatment of NA and organophosphate pesticide poisoning in humans and animals. These adaptazymes would also be very useful for decontamination of environmental deposits of organophosphates.",

        "abstract": "Under a prior Air Force SBIR program, buyCASTINGS.com and its technology division, FOPAT, developed an innovative material and process to manufacture patterns for the investment casting industry. Defying thousands of years of traditional investment casting practices, FOPAT\u2019s new process utilizes an advanced and proprietary foam material instead of wax. While FOPAT\u2019s product is a direct replacement for wax patterns, it is extremely cost competitive. The benefits of using FOPAT\u2019s foam technology include: scrap reduction, raw material savings, productivity improvements, energy savings, and environmental benefits. FOPAT matches the performance of wax patterns and overcomes the disadvantages of traditional wax patterns. FOPAT promises longer storage lives of patterns, allows for much easier shipment of patterns and easier handling of patterns in the casting process, and, most importantly, allows for the production of patterns with thin and complex sections.  The Air Force SBIR project is currently being extended to produce JSF engine components using the FOPAT material and process.  An initial cost benefit analysis for the Air Force revealed that the total cost of investment castings used in military engines is well over $0.5B, and improving casting costs by approximately 16% which is very possible with the proposed technology given potential material cost reduction of 30% and first time yield improvements as detailed in the proposal, this could result in a potential cost savings of over $ 75M annually for just the aircraft engine manufacturers. Additional cost savings for other weapon systems and applications would be assessed as part of cost-benefit analysis task in this project. This DLA project involves using quick, low-cost tooling methods for FOPAT pattern production. This Phase II proposal has been prepared to fully exploit the technical and commercial potential demonstrated during the DLA Phase I project.  While not all tasks have been completed on the Phase I project, buyCASTINGS.com has demonstrated the potential of the technology and its benefits to DLA \u2013 and is pleased to submit a Phase II proposal to address some remaining technical and commercial challenges.  In particular, this proposal addresses key technical hurdles for scaling up production - and assembles a team of resources, including commercial partners, to fully commercialize and transition FOPAT technology \u2013 into the military supply chain and private industry.   The proposed project meets the goals of the DLA by enhancing process efficiency, reducing cost, increasing productivity, while improving product performance and is fully supported by an experienced team and a long list of collaborators and commercial partners, including:  the US Army (ARDEC/Benet Labs), Steels Founders\u2019 Society of America, Nextec, Ransom & Randolph (Dentsply), and military supplier LT Enterprises, and foundries EPS, MCM, and BIMAC.  buyCASTINGS.com intends to work through its technology division FOPAT to manufacture and supply FOPAT patterns to foundries.  FOPAT patterns will be shipped to several capable investment casting foundries that have open capacity and short lead-times, enabling DLA to dramatically reduce the cost and time currently required to obtain discrete cast parts. There will be no more \u201clost tools\u201d or foundries holding the buyer hostage because they have the only tool and can demand almost whatever price they want. This will open up for more competition among foundries reducing the cost and lead-time for DLA parts.  buyCASTINGS and SFSA will use its network of foundries and suppliers to conduct foundry trials and industry evaluations to ensure that the proposed technology is scaled up and commercialized in Phase II and meets DLA\u2019s cost reduction goals. In addition, this project will help the US casting industry take significant step towards its 2020 goal of improved metal casting processes in three interrelated areas: improved product performance, reduced production costs, and reduced scrap rates.",

These approaches are not only expensive in terms of power, size and weight, but also costly. Alternatively, the use of liquid crystal (LC) lenses, LC spatial light modulators and LC scanners in zooming and scanning systems have been extensively researched but LC's suffer from drawbacks in terms of speed, aberrations and transmission. These limitations in zoom technology have been largely overcome with the development of Adaptive Polymer Lenses (APLs) by Holochip Corporation. Holochip Corporation, in conjunction with Sandia National Laboratories, has previously demonstrated compact adaptive optical zoom and aberration correction, using liquid crystal (LC) spatial light modulators (SLMs), LC lenses, and deformable mirrors. We have realized the benefit of eliminating the mechanical motion of static lenses and mirrors, demonstrating a significant reduction in the power and footprint of the system, and an increase in the speed of scanning/zooming. Further improvements will produce a high-speed, random-access, wide field-of-view, low-power zooming and scanning technology.",

The DP-12 autonomous tandem helicopter will prove its ability to minimize the time needed to map the progression of a CBRNE event as it moves across time, altitude, and geography. Simulation of efficient real-time mapping and planning will quantify the desired behavior and performance for an airborne CBRNE detection system. The DP-12 UAS will then validate the system through limited objective experiments to place, monitor, and adapt a CBRNE sensor network. The demonstrations will exploit the operational envelope of the unmanned aircraft systems\u2019 (UAS) capabilities in complex terrain to autonomously monitor and map a contaminant field. Mapping the CBRNE dispersion efficiently is critical to expedite safe ingress, egress, and evasive maneuvers of personnel to prevent further loss of life and limit exposure to harmful agents.",

        "abstract": "DSPCon is developing a powerful, modular, expandable, open-standards addition of processing capability for Propulsion Health Management (PHM) that will increase the speed with which PHM decisions can be made by an order of magnitude over current Full Authority Digital Electronic Control (FADEC) hardware and software.  DSPCon\u2019s goal for the Phase II effort is to develop, test, and demonstrate a prototype PHM processing unit that implements significant capability improvements over current FADEC hardware.  These improvements are that the new processor processes data at 10 times the speed of the FADEC hardware, can accommodate sensor data rates of up to 200 KHz, and can produce PHM actionable decisions every 20 msec.  With the development of this new PHM processor platform, DSPCon will fill a vital gap that currently exists in the PHM community, namely the lack of significant processing power to handle large amounts of data collected from sensors monitoring the engine and the data processing required to generate useful PHM information, in a timely manner, using numerically intensive algorithms.  The new PHM processor platform is designed to be embedded on an aircraft as well as serve as a development platform for advanced research in PHM algorithms.  BENEFIT:   Due to the algorithm development surplus in the past 10-15 years by a variety of small & large companies; the market and need for an advanced PHM processing platform that can handle the most numerically intensive algorithms is well defined.  There are a number of algorithms such as those that are model based, data driven, and hybrid that have shown a significant value added contribution but cannot be implemented due to the extensive processing capability that is needed.  DSPCon is confident that the product that will be derived from the PH II effort will have the ability to satisfy this processing issue.  The number of applications for the proposed system is quite vast and stretches into the military and commercial aircraft sectors in addition to applicability in PHM applications in both military and commercial ground and air vehicles.",

These investigations showed that high performance acoustic detection and discrimination of  targets of interest is feasible. During Phase I we also showed that high performance can be achieved with very low energy consumption.  During Phase II we will continue algorithm research for additional performance enhancements. Using our OmniSense\u00ae UGS system as a development platform, we will also design, develop, test and deliver a complete preproduction prototype acoustic detection sensor system.

Phase II will develop algorithms that can analyze a long period of signal from an environment, measure its activity level using entropy and multifractal dimensions, analyze its trends, learn the relationships between states of the signal through statistical learning methods, and then detect the time and location of unusual events using innovative statistical decision making techniques. These algorithms will be capable of detecting low level (e.g., a rural area) and high level (e.g., marketplace) seismic activities in the background and adjust their thresholds, metrics, and decision making methods for increasing their probability of detection to above 95%, reducing their false alarm to less than 1%, and location detection error to less than 30m. In addition, these algorithms will reduce the required storage space for the signals by at least 2 orders of magnitude.",

We will reuse and customize software from other sources to create a workflow platform that can accommodate various existing infrastructure models. We will develop user-friendly interfaces in creating this prototype. We will collaborate with another government agency to demonstrate the effectiveness of the prototype by modeling a regional infrastructure scenario of interest. This will demonstrate that CEFO can provide useful understanding of the complex interrelationships between actions and effects in an interconnected domestic infrastructure.

Although near-infrared (NIR) instruments have shown promise in recognizing hemorrhage, specific confounding factors must be solved to be reliable in early hemorrhage shock detection.

The objective of this proposal is to provide a compact point-of-care NIR instrument that is capable of quantitatively detecting early hemorrhage and monitoring therapeutic interventions.  Our proposal features collaboration between (1) a leading biomedical technology company (ISS, Inc., Champaign, IL) that produces state-of-the-art NIR tissue oximeters, and (2) a university research teams at UC Irvine, with tissue optics experts who have experience in the assessment of traumatic injury via NIR optical methods.

Better collaboration tools are need to support team situation awareness and coordinate distributed tasking. Our solution, HERMES, consists of two major elements: the SLATE spatial messaging collaboration tool and a new concept called Workflow Coordinating Representations (WCRs) that supports task management and distributed workflow. SLATE imports mission documents, such as maps, images, and timelines, and allows users to share annotations on those documents. WCRs provide a communal representation of distributed group tasks where all operators can share information, and comment on the on-going activity. It explicitly supports collaboration by managing the data involved in the activity, presenting task status information, and providing a place for users to comment, critique, and review. HERMES is specifically designed for maritime interdiction operations, but the concepts apply broadly, including military patrols, civil and private security operations, emergency management, industrial plant management, and damage control. Phase II will consist of a spiral process of design, development, evaluation, and transition. Empirical scientific tests of the design will contribute to our theoretical understanding of small, distributed team collaboration and support technology.",

The current MILSATCOM system supports one downlink antenna beam in the frequency band 20.2-21.2 GHz.  The goal of TSAT is to transform communications so that every warfighter in the field has rapid access to information for decision-making purposes. In order to achieve increased capability in the near future, the MILSATCOM capacity must be increased through the use of multi-band, multi-beam satellite antennas.  The primary objective of this effort is to develop and demonstrate a simultaneous and completely independent two-beam transmit antenna that has the capability to support MILSATCOM down link. Under this Phase II effort AOE proposes demonstration of several key pieces of hardware associated with the antenna architecture developed under the Phase I effort and then to include measured results from the hardware in an overall system-level performance evaluation.  The key pieces of hardware to be demonstrated under the Phase II effort include a high efficiency power amplifier, key COTS components of the Tx module, and the antenna radiating aperture.  BENEFIT:   The results of the research will have far-reaching applications including both commercial and military satellite communication operations. In addition to TSAT, SATCOM systems are in general evolving toward improved coverage, broader bandwidth, higher data throughput systems that will need wide-band, multi-beam antennas like those proposed here. Additional areas where this technology may be employed are in airborne and ground communication terminals that require simultaneous contact with multiple satellites.",

The Phase I program will be aimed at demonstrating the feasibility of improving the FEG performance by: (a) systematically exploring new materials to enhance the remanent polarization in ferroelectric (FE) to antiferroelectric (AFE) phase-change compositions; (b) developing single-crystal PZT 95/5 components to exploit the intrinsic anisotropy that is present in single-crystal materials; and (c) exploring the use of composite structures to engineer higher electric breakdown fields and to achieve interesting geometric combinations of electrical properties.  Electrical properties of the sample will be evaluated at TRS and samples will be delivered to HEM Technologies for explosively driven shock depolarization testing.  During the Phase I and II program TRS will immediately incorporate new advances in FEG technology into our commercially available PZT 95/5 products.  At the conclusion of the Phase II program TRS will have established pilot manufacturing capabilities for a number of high energy density pulse-discharge components directly applicable to directed energy and detonation systems currently under development.",

The coating consists of a unique plasma pretreatment of the polycarbonate to improve adhesion and a combination of layers forming a grading in the mechanical properties from the soft polycarbonate to a hard overcoat. Using this process, coatings with a 10x improvement in abrasion resistance, excellent optical matching to the polycarbonate, and improved ballistic performance relative to industry standard siloxane hard coatings was demonstrated. The Phase-II project builds upon the excellent Phase-I results by optimizing the coating process and design, refining the grading of the mechanical properties and introducing surface modifications of the polycarbonate for improved hardness. The coatings will be evaluated per MilSpec standards for ballistic performance, abrasion resistance, chemical exposure, and environmental durability.  The end goal will be a manufacturing process capable of supplying low cost, highly abrasion resistant coatings on polycarbonate lenses and visors with significantly improved ballistic protection for the warfighter.",

Military operations benefiting from the data products based on space/time imaging include expeditionary forces, landing zone bathymetry, wave & current determination. The focus of the Phase II effort will be to fully transition the major TLS products into the COBRA PMA station. The baseline tasks will consist of integrating the TLS Currents and Bathymetry (Bathy, Sand Bar, and SZ Characterization) with the COBRA PMA station. The optional task will consist of integrating Digital Elevation Maps (DEM) with the COBRA PMA station. The proposed technology will significantly aid in the planning of MCM assault breaching missions and rescue missions.

In inhalation burn victims, certain pathophysiological changes occur at a very small length scales in airway tissues immediately following exposure.

To solve above problems, OCT Medical Imaging Inc (OCTMI), proposes to develop and test an advanced light-based, fiber-optic imaging system using a platform imaging technology known as Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT). In Phase II, we will extend our successful Phase I results and develop an advanced compact real-time 3D-OCT system incorporating advanced light source. By consulting with clinicians, we pan to develop user-friendly software and test our 3D-OCT probes and OCT systems using an animal smoke inhalation model developed at our collaborators laboratory. Based on above studies, we will refine our 3D-OCT probe, systems and software and evaluate them in bronchoscopic airway detection sensitivity and specificity to gold standard histologic imaging in patients.

When the EA-18G enters service it will be equipped with ALQ-99 jammer pods that were initially designed for the EA-6 in the late 1960's. NAVAIR recognizes the limitations inherent in continuing to upgrade the ALQ-99, and, has identified a need for a Next Generation Jammer Pod with capabilities matched to the EA-18G. The NGJ Pod will be powered by an on-board turbine / generator to make the pod independent from aircraft power sources. The pod will require a minimum of 60 KVA of power generated at an airspeed of 220 knots and an altitude of 25,000 feet, with the turbine/generator located within the body of the pod. The key metrics for pod power generation are weight and volume efficiency. In Phase I SA has demonstrated the feasibility of power generation for this application with an internal, tangential in-flow Tesla (bladeless) turbine. A Tesla turbine packages well, has a relatively high power to weight ratio and requires only a short length of ducting to route air into the turbine. The proposed Phase 2 effort will focus on designing, testing, and optimizing a full-scale prototype turbine unit in a relevant environment.",

        "abstract": "The flame stability in typical augmenters is largely determined by vitiated air composition and high preheat temperature of the incoming flow.  Presence of significant quantities of CO2 and H2O in the vitiated air will affect the oxidation characteristics of jet fuels by increasing the third-body collision efficiencies of initiation and recombination reactions. Traditionally, kinetic models are validated against data acquired for unvitiated air.  Thus, it is essential to validate the kinetic models against data obtained at typical augmenter operating conditions.  Combustion Science & Engineering, Inc. proposes to acquire new experimental data using vitiated air at low pressures for JP8 and S8 fuels.  The data will include sub-atmospheric pressure ignition delay time data (at CSE), atmospheric laminar flame speed data (at Georgia Tech) and sub-atmospheric pressure laminar flame speed experiments (at Princeton University).   CSE will also develop a model reduction tool to generate reduced models from detailed kinetic mechanisms that are validated against the experimental data acquired in this project.  These reduced kinetic models can be implemented in CFD for practical augmenter simulations for commercial applications.   BENEFIT:   The ultimate result of this research will be the development of a CFDC modeling tool that will be useful for engineers to design augmentors and other flameholding devices in practical applications.  This will provide a design tool for predicting static stability limits and flame propagation in afterburner combustion systems.  The market for this product will include gas turbine designers and manufacturers for both military and civilian aircraft.  The use of this tool will significantly reduce development costs by eliminating some design iterations and hardware testing, which is quite expensive and time-consuming.",

An additional objective was to develop algorithms to visualize and determine the size, shape, and velocity of a droplet in a lab setup. The method should be extendable from a single droplet to multiple droplets such as in a cloud or rain, and to other kinds of objects such as sand particles.  We have developed the lab setup and methodology of droplet 3-D shape/size visualization and deformation using digital holography, and analog dynamic holography using photorefractive materials and holocameras. After careful comparison of both approaches including experimental results and inferences, convenience, speed, and cost, we suggest that digital holographic scheme(s) should be the preferred method of choice in Phase II for multiple droplets, sand particles, etc., and in high-speed dynamic laboratory/test site environments.

        "abstract": "Traditional adaptive processing utilizes the return signal in a manner designed to extract maximal information from a given radar return.  MIMO radar processing, which is predicated on a totally digital receiver and an AESA transmitter is envisioned to take this one step further via the transmission of a complex, spatially diverse signal which is designed to enhance the separation of returns at the receiver.   This is what drives the concept of orthogonal waveforms.   The interactions of the orthogonal waveforms, based on the manner in which they are processed on receive, defines, among other things, both transmit and receive patterns. In a MIMO radar, array and waveform design, therefore belong together and cannot be separated. TSC\u2019s phase II proposal is composed of two parts.  The first part is to participate in the process of designing the antenna geometry by supplying waveforms specifically tailored to bring out aspects of the antenna/waveform interaction. The second part of TSC\u2019s proposal is geared toward the development of a suite of MIMO waveforms, and corresponding processing techniques, specifically designed for the chosen antenna configuration, with an outlook to supporting adaptive MIMO operations.    BENEFIT:   MIMO technology is a likely next phase in the evolution of radar.  Just as STAP and other adapt on receive technologies have blossomed as computer and signal processing became increasingly more powerful, the concept of adapt for transmit waveform generation will benefit from ever increasing processing potential.  This phase II effort will provide for groundbreaking waveform generation capabilities which will pave the way for MIMO technologies to be incorporated in a wide range of military and civilian radar applications.",

We estimate that our final process will cost at least five-fold less per dome to use and require an order of magnitude less funding for capital equipment when a fabrication line is established. In Phase II of the research, we will optimize each step in the process for the production of gridded domes in quantity and ensure that the technology will transition to satisfy the military\u2019s need for patterned domes. A major component of the research in Phase II is the development a device that enables the automation or semi-automated inking and stamping of the flexible stamp used to pattern the dome. We will also ensure that each step in our process is compatible with Alon and spinel, of which missile domes are made.

Phase II will also focus on the development of the next generation high fidelity and highly computationally efficient rotorcraft structural dynamics  analysis tool in the framework of RCAS which will accommodate higher order  (2D/3D) finite elements for rotorcraft structural dynamics and the highly  efficient solution.

        "abstract": "Threat of attack from within obscuring foliage is a very real threat to U.S. riverine craft or other marine operations close to shore. Generally, this asymmetric situation allows opposing forces to hide undetected within or behind bushes and trees until an opportune moment for attack. On the other hand, shipboard personnel are relatively exposed and well-lit by sunlight, and have difficulty obtaining any visibility of impending attack. Technology that is able to provide visibility into the foliage at water\u2019s edge can provide warning of suspicious activity, allowing the marine craft to assume a defensive posture or take pre-emptive action. Nanohmics proposes to build an electro-optical imaging device (called the ThruView\u2122) capable of producing imagery within dense stands of brush, bushes, and trees. The innovative imaging system is based on hardware which records the four-dimensional light-field from objects in the field of view, providing real-time back-end processing to form images of objects that may be mostly obscured by intervening foliage. The optical system is capable of operating in the visible, SWIR, and/or MWIR portions of the spectrum.

        "abstract": "Technical Abstract Current economic conditions and an aging population are increasing the strain on the Medicaid program, which is the main funding source for long-term skilled nursing care.  In 2008, Medicaid spending for long-term care was $99.9 billion and growing at a rate of 8.6% annually.  Given that the population of persons over 65 years of age is expected to grow from 35 million in the year 2000 to 53 million in the year 2020 and over 80 million by the year 2050 [2] alternative methods to long-term care must be found.  The issue of aging is even more acute for the Veterans Administration as 39.4 percent of the nation's veteran population is over the age of 65, compared with 12 percent of the general population [3].  Given these demographic trends for aging and the high costs associated with skilled nursing care alternative approaches to long-term care must be adopted.  To help address this issue of long-term care costs, Healthsense proposes an extension of the original Phase II research to deploy wellness monitoring and assistive technologies to reduce the progression of older veterans into skilled nursing facilities.  The Healthsense\u00ae eNeighbor\u00ae system, developed in part with funding from the National Institute of Health and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency provides real-time wellness monitoring and assistive prompts that enable older veterans to remain in their homes longer or to transition from Skilled Nursing Facilities (SNFs) to Home and Community Based Care.  The eNeighbor System notifies caregivers when a significant change in routine indicates a potential problem and provides them with insight and information to more accurately tailor or prioritize care plans. The eNeighbor system also provides assistive prompts that help the older adult complete activities of daily living more independently.  The overall technical objective for the project is to slow the progression of the older adult to the next level of care.  The primary goals are: \u2022 Enabling the older adult to remain as independent as possible and enjoy a higher quality of life \u2022 Assisting care providers in managing the transition points between levels of care \u2022 Providing family members with assurance that adverse events are detected and responded to as quickly as possible \u2022 Compiling evidence that payers (either private or public) incur less costs by slowing the progression thru the care continuum",

While recent research efforts on database based query processing dramatically improves the efficiency of query processing, another critical component, security, is still missing. The key innovation of this work is an Efficient Trusted Querying Framework (ETQF), in which the trust evaluation mechanism is built to identify the trustworthy of sensor nodes, distinguish illegal/misbehaving nodes from normal sensors, and filter out bogus data in the querying process. The work is motivated from the well studied reputation and trust relations in the field of social sciences. Our main strategy here is to analyze various security breaches during the querying process, fully exploit the advantages of existing trust management mechanisms, and extend them into the WSNs. Our final goal is to develop an efficient trusted querying approach that can return the highest-fidelity response to the user while monitoring the health of the network by flagging suspected compromised nodes.",

The effort identified practical solution bounds for erecting leak proof search volumes for both elliptical and circular deep space orbital regimes including the geosynchronous belt.  The resulting solution space was then characterized in terms of applicable radar measurements and a solution approach was proposed for conducting searchesand detecting and tracking unknown space objects within these orbital regimes.  The project will validate the enhancements predicted through analysis using high fidelity digital and analog simulation and determine if these techniques can be deployed along with determining the impact on other rdar mission areas.   BENEFIT:   The US military relies more and more heavily on space assets to accomplish its missions. Likewise with many commercial entities.  Many of these assets reside within the deep space regime and are vulnerable to attack and disruption.  Protectng these assets requires awareness of the operational situationand the US has a tremendous need for 24/7 deep space surveillance assets.  The benefits of this R&D effort are that it will lead to the inexpensive conversion of between six and eight strategic radar to add a deep space surveillance capability and the technology can be applied to additional space surveillance assets currently in the acquisition process.

        "abstract": "This project is to develop a new fuze for precise air-burst detonation of munitions. Recent fuze sensing advances [1] could greatly increase the effectiveness of small munitions/ordinance such as those fired by the 40 mm, M-203 grenade launcher by replacing the point-contact fuze with a radar fuze. Point contact fuzing can allow more than 95% of the explosive potential of the round to be directed into the ground, essentially blowing up dirt [2]. The purpose of this proposal is to develop and deliver an innovative, low power, long shelf life standoff radar fuze sensor that will enable precise fuzing at optimal position from the target, raising the effectiveness of the round, and recovering the wasted 95% energy. Air-bursting munitions can be more lethal, provide better logistics, and lower overall costs. An air-bursting munition can lighten individual soldier loads by providing greater firepower in a smaller package, and that will enhance individual Marine and unit battlefield effectiveness. A 95% more effective round means soldiers can carry fewer rounds to accomplish missions and that fewer rounds need be purchased for inventory and storage. The USMC desires development of new Radar Actuating Micro Sensor (RAMS) proximity fuzes for 40mm rounds in particular and small munitions and ordnance in general. RAMS capability increases lethality and reliability, simultaneously improving performance and easing post-conflict issues such as cleanup and disposal of unexploded ordnance. The RAMS fuze sensor must be physically tiny, operate on a small power supply, and be reliable and immune to countermeasures. The sensor should also function well in the myriad of potential CONOPS, including conventional battlefield dug-in targets, light armor targets and urban situations. It also must have a long shelf-life. Sperient proposes to develop such a fuze on a single microchip. Based on two recent and successful projects: 1) the Phase I predecessor project to this proposed effort demonstrated circuitry, a low parts count circuit board that successfully and repeatedly functioned at over a variety of materials in drop testing and 2) a DARPA project [3] where Sperient successfully designed and built similar circuitry into a microchip, a single microchip radar fuze sensor is well within reach. Based on Sperient\u2019s innovation in signaling that exploits the advantages of short impulses of energy and our unique method for correlation, Sperient\u2019s Micro Pulse Radar (MPR) has a sensitive window for accurately detecting reflections from boundaries. By utilizing very short pulses, maximum target information is acquired with the minimum power.",

        "abstract": "The development of optimal engine exhaust noise reduction technology for tactical aircraft continues to rely heavily on laboratory-scale testing due to the absence of appropriate modeling and analysis capability. Thus, concept identification relies largely on engineering intuition, ad hoc reasoning, and exhaustive parametric testing. Another obstacle to the development of exhaust noise technology is the absence of integrated tools for simultaneous assessment of aero-acoustic and aerodynamic performance. The research proposed by TTC Technologies, Inc., (TTC) is to develop and demonstrate innovative methodologies for simultaneous nozzle acoustic and aerodynamic design applicable to supersonic jet exhaust noise reduction in tactical aircraft. Methodologies will be demonstrated via concept design/analysis, followed by experimental validation at model scale. Improved computational efficiency and turn-around will be achieved by developing more robust and efficient numerical procedures. The methodologies will be integrated into a design procedure and applied to nozzle geometries being developed in ongoing Department of Defense noise reduction programs. The proposed effort leverages existing advanced TTC tools, as well as novel jet noise modeling and experimental diagnostic capabilities currently being developed under a NAVAIR-funded effort involving TTC, United Technologies Research Center (UTRC) and California Institute of Technology (CIT).",

        "abstract": "SOCOM requires a method to field repair multiple materials as well as to mount armor and related hardware for a variety of tactical purposes with a composite material.  To address this need, we propose application of a \u201cModular UV Patch\u201d (MUVP) system that incorporates ultraviolet curing resin systems and an innovative technique for delivering the UV light through optically leaky fibers that form a composite material.  This patented modular patch system will be self-contained, easy to use, and provides rapid curing (seconds) while also providing a capability for underwater applications.  The UV based resin systems offer increased shelf life, and elimination of special storage facilities, with a minimal \u201ctail\u201d of supporting equipment while maintaining the strength associated with both conventional thermal cures and competing bonding compounds.  The Phase I effort successfully demonstrated safe and quick attachment to a variety of materials.  The Phase II effort will further the development of this system, validate prototypes with operational environmental testing and deliver 10 prototypes. BENEFITS: The successful implementation of this concept would result in a modular UV resin-based composite repair and patching system which could offer an order of magnitude reduction in cure times and a greatly simplified repair process relative to current thermally based resin systems.  A commercial product based on this technology has applications wherever fast-turnaround field repair of composite structures is needed, including structures, aircraft repairs, marine applications, and potential medical uses.  This technology has an even greater commercial potential in the manufacture of new composite products and where fast, on-demand bonding of dissimilar materials is required.",

        "abstract": "In Phase I, TSC developed a clutter mitigation technique that will allow radars of the BMDS to better detect, track and discriminate targets in the presence of tumbling dipole clutter and jamming countermeasures.  The clutter mitigation technique is based on a novel adaptive signal processing (generalized STAP) algorithm that discriminates among classes of scatterers that move on general non-linear space-time paths. The generalized STAP algorithm is a novel synthesis of ideas from TSC\u2019s successful 3D radar imaging programs with adaptive signal processing. The algorithm is unlike techniques that attempt to \u2018burn through\u2019 clutter by using a combination of very large relative bandwidth, ultra-long coherent integration and exhaustive hypothesis testing.  Instead, it adaptively produces deep detection nulls in a subspace of the joint image-motion space of ballistic target scatterer motion.   This processing will facilitate detection, 3D radar imaging and precise motion estimation of targets.  In Phase II, an innovative algorithm is offered that adaptively cancels radar dipole clutter and jamming prior to target detection, for subsequent 3D radar imaging or any other type of signal processing.    TSC will further mature the algorithm and quantify its performance relative to other leading clutter suppression techniques using benchmark clutter data from the Hercules CCWG.",

        "abstract": "Two radiation hardened 3D integrated circuit memory devices will be fabricated under this effort. The 3D devices are created by the wafer level 3D bonding of separate silicon substrates. Within each of the ~200 die in the resultant wafer stack, there some 5 million vertical interconnects. The very high level of 3D interconnect allows unprecedented vertical circuit optimization. In this case the two proposed devices will be fabricated with the same masks and both will share the same memory cell layers that are also used for Tezzaron\u2019s standard commercial memories. This allows not only a cost reduction but also eases commercial production by keeping the non-ASIC portion of the components in common. The core effort in this program is developing a new hardened by design logic layer (wafer) that will improve the circuit reliability for space and military applications. The 3D integration by its nature will also give improve density, power and performance. Without 3D, the intended hardening improvements would be entirely impossible.  BENEFIT:   Higher density memory with significantly improved power and reliability with high radiation tolerance. Also due to the sharing of volume commercial pieces, a more reasonable cost structure should be achievable.",

Significant improvements will be implemented to expand RCAS functionality, accuracy, and usability. RCAS functionality will be greatly expanded with the addition of new complex rotorcraft components that allow users to model exotic configurations easily and with high fidelity. The functionality and accuracy of RCAS aerodynamics calculations will be enhanced through updates to the airloads, induced velocity, and interference aerodynamics models. In addition, the airloads calculations will be improved through the expansion of the Peters, Hsieh, and Torrero airloads module implemented in Phase I of this SBIR. Improvements to convergence characteristics, and the implementation of more robust routines for handling program data, will make RCAS much more efficient when modeling large and complex models. RCAS user efficiency will be improved through the coupling of RCAS with widely used external programs to allow users to easily import/export data between programs. To improve RCAS usability, an intuitive graphical user interface for model input, analysis, and output will be implemented. The graphical user interface, designed in Phase I of this SBIR, will greatly enhance user efficiency and confidence through improved feedback, flexibility, and help.",

During our Phase I effort of this project, Applied EM designed a novel low profile antenna based on a volumetric (shape and topology) design that operates over 30-2000MHz. Preliminary simulations and measurements already verified the successful design of this concept. During Phase II, we will finalize the design, build better prototypes, provide validations via measurements, and deliver antenna structures that suitable for commercialization and integration purposes.  Various magnetic ground plane improvements (to recover free space gain), matching circuits for low frequencies and dielectric loadings are proposed. In addition, a novel concept will be realized for concurrent vertical polarization monopole-like patterns at low frequencies and circularly polarized patch-like patterns at UHF and above. Platform integration studies will be also carried out for various larger and smaller platforms.

        "abstract": "Measurements of vehicle/test article component loads and control-surface loads are required during testing to provide vital information for flight vehicle control, design and performance estimation and for structural design loads prediction.  Accurate measurements of forces and moments experienced by the test article are critical during wind tunnel tests.   Typical wind tunnel conditions are speeds of Mach 8 at total temperature up to 900 \u00baF.  Thermal effects associated with testing in the continuous-flow hypersonic wind tunnel impose challenges for strain-gauge balances or other force/moment measuring devices used for component loads.  A non-water-cooled thermal protection and compensation design solution is needed.  In this proposal, Intelligent Automation Inc. (IAI) proposes to develop innovative sensor architectures, electronics, and software techniques to provide the force sensor with capabilities of continuous measurements under high temperature without water-cooling or thermal protection.   BENEFIT:   Force and displacement measurements are the most common requirements for many applications, including the electro-mechanical system monitoring, dynamic feedback control, and actuation etc.  The stain-gauge based load cells normally are not suitable for harsh environments such as at high temperatures.  The proposed high temperature force sensor has many unique advantages because it possesses a strong noise-resistance and sustains to harsh environments.  Besides for hypersonic wind tunnel tests, this sensor design can be applied to many high/cryogenic temperature applications such as the surface ships and submarines, air and ground vehicles, etc. as well as mechanical control and monitoring in strong radiation environments such as the nuclear power plant.  Therefore, the commercial potential of this research results is very high.",

        "abstract": "While on deployment, many military surgeons spend the bulk of their time performing general and/or trauma surgery. With combat deployments averaging 12-18 months, such prolonged lapses in practice can degrade the surgeons\u2019 specialized knowledge and skills. This becomes a major problem upon their return stateside, when they are expected to resume their specialty duties with little or no re-credentialing. The envisioned product of this SBIR is the IMPACTTM Surgical Skills Trainer (IMPACT-SST), a deployable training program that will help military surgeons maintain their specialty knowledge and skills. During Phase II, Aptima will develop several cognitive skills training modules that will supplement the American College of Surgeons (ACS)-accredited Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery training curriculum. Next, Aptima will develop a deployable, SCORM-conformant, multimedia training tool that leverages the deliberate practice approach to complex skill acquisition and maintenance. IMPACT-SST will fuse multimedia instruction, practical application exercises, diagnostic feedback, guided self-reflection, and video annotation to enhance the learning experience. Finally, Aptima will rigorously evaluate IMPACT-SST using William Beaumont Hospital\u2019s advanced laparoscopic surgery simulation center. The end result will be an empirically-validated training curriculum that minimizes knowledge and skill decay, and an accompanying suite of performance measurement tools for re-credentialing purposes.",

        "abstract": "The Main Base Landfill at Edwards Air Force Base will reach full capacity by no later than 2017, and many other landfills across the country are facing the same situation. Waste streams need to be redirected to extend the lives of these facilities. In Phase I, Mainstream successfully demonstrated that a portable, fast-pyrolysis, fluidized-bed reactor can significantly reduce the amount of biomass material entering the landfill and produce a useful liquid fuel.  During Phase II, we will scale our bench-scale pyrolysis reaction system up to pilot scale.  The pilot-scale system will be a fully continuous, fully automated reactor capable of converting 10% of the Main Base Landfill greenwaste inflow, or 35 kg/hr, into bio-oil.  The pilot-scale system will be designed, built, and fully characterized in Phase II. A full-scale Phase-III process capable of processing a significant portion of the organic waste stream entering the landfill will also be designed. The full-scale design will include designs for all process units, overall flow and energy requirements, and estimates of capital and operating costs. The Phase II option task will address upgrading the raw bio-oil to improve its stability, miscibility, and materials compatibility.  BENEFIT:   The 1,600 landfills in the U.S. process over 240 million tons of garbage each year. Many landfills are reaching their capacity and sites for creating new landfills are increasingly limited. Hauling waste to remote landfills, which expends energy and resources, may soon become a necessity for both military bases and municipalities. Conversion of waste to bio-oil would greatly reduce the volume of material that reaches the landfill, and therefore extend the life of current facilities. A portable, flash-pyrolysis, fluidized-bed reactor that is purpose-built for the complex landfill biomass feed stream could be rapidly deployed to remote locations such as forward overseas military installations and smaller, rural landfills. The bio-oil produced from these reactors would provide an alternative, non-petroleum source of home heating oil, which 8.1 million American homes rely on for heat, and which is often subject to price surges and temporary shortages. The bio-oil can also readily be upgraded for use as a transportation fuel.",

Significant electrical energy is necessary to support a range of applications including electromagnetic armor, electromagnetic gun and electro-mechanical aircraft launch systems.

The focus of the proposed commercialization pilot program (CPP) is the scaled manufacturing and demonstration of high energy density dielectric film for wound capacitors. Dielectric formulations will be based on TPL\u00a1\u00afs polymer and/or nanocomposite formulation. The prior Phase II SBIR focused on a nanocomposite system consisting of fluorinone polyester (FPE) polymer and TPL\u00a1\u00afs titanate nanopowders. The proposed program includes three areas of focus; film optimization, scale of film manufacturing and capacitor fabrication. Tasks for each development period will be performed sequentially in six month increments and include specific milestones, performance targets and deliverables. The overall objective of the program is to establish manufacturability and demonstrate the energy density capabilities of TPL\u00a1\u00afs polymer film in sub-scale capacitors. Wound film capacitor sections will be fabricated and evaluated relative to system level performance specifications.

Drilling in assembly operations is performed on components made from stack-ups of composites, aluminum and titanium. Problems associated with hole quality, tool life and interlayer burrs are pervasive and result in costly destack and debur operations. Trial-and-error methodologies for improving drilling processes can be expensive, time consuming and have little guarantee of success.  Development of new innovations has been hampered by empirical methodologies.  It is therefore desirable to develop new physics-based modeling technologies for composite/metal stack-up drilling. Physics-based modeling will eliminate trial-and-error testing and enable the identification of process parameters and tooling to alleviate rework and scrap.   Our Phase II program will further develop and demonstrate physics-based modeling for improved drilling processes of composite/metal stack-ups. Our Phase I results demonstrated model correlation to improved tool life and productivity. In Phase II, we enhance the constitutive model for composite workpieces and demonstrate improvements in conjunction with industry partners.

Currently, fielded systems are not up to the task as they are not able to dynamically modify their behavior to suit the changing environment and they can be immobilized by simple component failures. Future operations will not tolerate such brittleness, especially given the interconnectivity demanded by network-centric warfare. Future fielded systems throughout the military will need more dynamic processing capabilities. Self-Aware Computing attempts to resolve this problem through metacognitive approaches to generating dynamic capabilities based on research into human adaptation. However, these approaches tend to ignore the impact of human emotions in that adaptation. Emotions are evolutionarily proven mechanisms that enable humans to rapidly and broadly adapt to threats, rapidly adapt to new situations, and effectively communicate threats and problems to others. We propose to develop Modular Affective Reasoning-Based Versatile Introspective (MARVIN) components that enhance self-aware systems by exploiting ideas from human affect to (1) adapt quickly to time-critical situations, (2) adapt to new situations and carry learning over to new situations, and (3) interact with other networked systems in an efficient social manner.",

By directly modeling the physics of rotary-wing aerodynamics in real-time, these models provide high fidelity with minimal tuning and are straightforward to update for new aircraft. Extensive validation has established the ability of these new methods to accurately predict many key aerodynamic metrics without any reliance on test data. The new models have already been incorporated into simulation and analysis software by all major U.S. rotorcraft manufacturers. The effort proposed here is to extend these models from rotor and rotor wake aerodynamics to include full aircraft aerodynamics, including the fuselage, empennage and wing, for both tiltrotors and conventional helicopters. A three-pronged effort is proposed involving, (1) expansion of existing methods to include real-time physical models of all aircraft component aerodynamics, (2) incorporation of new models into government and industry tiltrotor simulations and (3) validation and qualification of the new tiltrotor simulation through comparison with flight test data. Emphasis will be on developing flexible, robust, modules easy to install across multiple simulation platforms and scalable to improve in fidelity as computer hardware improves.",

As with any onboard sensor, designers must consider the antenna/platform interaction, and mature tools exist to address this type of problem. However, at these wavelengths, airborne vehicles can span several thousand wavelengths. This is well beyond the capability of any full-wave electromagnetic solver. While asymptotic techniques are practical here, they are powerless to model the antennas, themselves. We propose to develop two novel techniques for integrating asymptotic and full-wave methods that can solve the end-to-end antenna/platform integration problem. One technique folds physical optics directly into method-of-moments to greatly expand the size of problem it can handle, but without compromising accuracy. The other splits the problem into small (full-wave) and large (asymptotic) regions, the novelty being the ease of integration that allows both solution regimes to fully couple.

        "abstract": "The next generation tactical transport must achieve greater performance than its predecessors, with even more demanding missions and operational requirements, at an affordable price. New mobility concepts have emerged with more radical configurations for potential operational performance benefits. The challenge of this proposed SBIR program is to combine advanced materials and process technologies with advanced innovative design concepts, to achieve a more affordable and lightweight deep section wing for next generation transport aircraft applications.  An innovative structural wing design will be developed using HyPerVARTM\u00ae/AFI\u2122 manufacturing technology for integrated resin infused structures.  Several innovative structural concepts have been evaluated that leverage 3-D performing technology and advancements in design and manufacturing of these structures to achieve lower costs with greater structural efficiency.  The Phase I program demonstrated the feasibility of this technology approach through engineering trade studies, development of a wing box design with 25% weight reduction and 35% cost reduction, and virtual and physical manufacturing process demonstration on a subcomponent. This Phase II program will build on Phase I concepts with the design, fabrication and testing of prototype wing box section that will verify analysis predictions, and evaluate resin infused integrated structure capability for primary structural applications.   BENEFIT:   The use of HyperVARTM\u00ae/AFI\u2122 process technology and 3-D preforms will provide a low cost manufacturing process for building complex deep section wing skin and substructure elements, and an approach for integrating and assembling deep-wing components with robust and durable joining methods. Additional detailed benefits of this SBIR program include: \u2022 Design requirements mapped out for next generation transport wing and baseline design for comparison. \u2022 Conceptual designs of large deep-section wings that use HyPerVARTM\u00ae/AFI\u2122 technology and have reduced weight, improved producibility and affordability than existing advanced wing design concepts \u2022 Definition of the preferred composites manufacturing processes for components and assembly based on trade studies, virtual manufacturing demonstrations, and subcomponent demonstration \u2022 Full-scale wingbox design and analysis of preferred structural concept, fabricated and validated through full-scale structural testing of a representative wing box section. In summary, the end payoff will be a deep-section transport wing that can achieve reduction in weight and cost relative to existing advanced transport design, with ease of manufacturing due to advanced material product forms and reduced fabrication and assembly tooling requirements. The Phase II program will focus on the ACCA wing as baseline, leverage ongoing advanced transport concept development programs to focus and direct this development of innovative wing design and manufacturing concepts developed in Phase I, and more rapidly demonstrate technologies on prototype hardware through subcomponent testing in Phase II.  This approach will enable more rapid insertion into the next-generation transport program and potential multi-platform application through the future commercialization phase.",

After time, a heavily populated simulation capability will be created that can do a significant amount of testing without a physical test workbench.  Our goal is an extremely scalable simulation test bench that allows the Electronic Proving Grounds to represent not only the interactions among applications, protocols, and physical channels, but also allow easily modifiable configurations of large numbers of radio network nodes.   The three primary objectives of the project are: \u2022 Create a highly-scalable radio behavior model that can plug into existing simulators. \u2022 Capture data from EPG test bench procedures to feed into that model. \u2022 Incorporate existing simulations that use our developed behavior model into EPG testing procedures",

Even with such improvements, current high power fiber lasers still exhibit numerous trade-offs in laser beam quality, system size and diode pump fiber delivery complexity and cost.  New high power fiber laser designs should circumvent these complex and expensive system integration issues with simpler, smaller and more straightforward scalable designs.  New high power fiber laser architectures should eliminate pump beam combining, free space pump beam launch optics and multiple fiber coupling.  Kigre proposes to integrate unique athermal fiber gain materials and pumping architectures into compact high power eye-safe fiber laser devices operating in the 1.5 micron region.

A sensor-to-symbol architecture regularizes the connections between the sensed physical world and the symbols that represent that world.  Our approach consists of representing sensors in a domain-independent language, representing the world in an object ontology and developing a reasoning substrate that connects the two. The reasoning substrate is based on a computational cognitive architecture called Polyscheme.

SOProF is based on three POC innovations: (1) use of a new axially symmetric optical/mechanical configuration, (2) use of multiple detectors to increase SNR, and (3) novel integration of state-of-the-art optical and optimized electronic components. These innovations, and the principle of laser triangulation, will enable the new 40 mm airburst projectile to hit camouflaged and defilade targets without any fuze preset and with minimal modification to the fire control system. SOProF will activate a round\u2019s payload 2-3 m from the target. In Phase II POC will design and build a prototype SOProF, making maximum use of COTS components, integrate it into a 40 mm projectile, and test it in cooperation with Metal Storm Inc. This laboratory and field testing will demonstrate the airburst capabilities of a SOProF prototype assembled with a dummy practice round and an HE airburst round, reaching TRL-5/6 by project end.",

        "abstract": "The United States Government has an urgent need to update the Missile Defense Agency''s Ballistic Missile Defense program.  A key element of this program is the telemetry link providing the critical data exchange between the Ground Based Telemetry System and the airborne interceptor vehicle.  This mission requires a broadband telemetry link supporting a high data rate on both the uplink and downlink. Current GBTS terminal architectures are based on systems which combine dish antennas with mechanical gimbals.  This architecture supports only single point interceptor operation with a limited response time.  Both the single point interceptor operation and the limited response time present serious deficiencies which must be addressed with updated systems. A phased array antenna is the only solution which will provide the data rates and beam agility required for future GBTS terminals.  However, in order to field this type of solution, the manufacturing cost of phased array antennas must be reduced by a significant factor. The proposed FIRST RF approach represents a dramatic departure from conventional phased array architectures resulting in a significant cost reduction.  FIRST RF demonstrated the cost advantages of this innovative approach during Phase I with the fabrication and testing of a large K-Band passive array.",

Rapid launch and recovery of these vehicles will be critical to mission success. Currently, mechanical recovery techniques are highly dependent upon the unique operator controls resident on each watercraft to guide the vehicle into a final recovery position. In the case of USVs, the operator is hampered by limited sight lines to the incoming vehicle and surrounding seas, and has a challenging \u201creverse perspective\u201d for controlling the incoming vehicle. This current process results in operational limitations, increased recovery timelines, and increased risk of damage to the deployed vehicle and the ship. Robotic Research, LLC in partnership with General Dynamics Robotic Systems (GDRS), proposes the development of the Operator-aided Autonomous Recovery System (OARS), a standard control system for recovery of USVs and manned OOVs from a Littoral Combat Ship (LCS). OARS will make use of an established Hierarchical Control Architecture and Tactical Control Unit that have been effectively used for the control of several successful Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs).",

Blade antennas are inherently resonant structures that are difficult to extend to wider bandwidths, they impact the flight characteristics of faster aircraft, and they may present an ice accumulation problem on some aircraft. There is a need for replacement of blade antennas with low profile broadband antennas to address the explosive growth of communication and connectivity needs. Over the past decade, Applied EM has been involved in the development and commercialization of broadband antenna technology. During our Phase I effort of this project, Applied EM studied novel low profile antenna designs based on a volumetric (shape and topology) design that operates over 30-2000MHz. Preliminary simulations already verified the successful design of this concept. During Phase II, we will finalize the design, build prototypes, provide validations via measurements, and deliver antenna structures that suitable for commercialization and integration purposes.",

        "abstract": "During Phase I, MARK Resources very successfully demonstrated the feasibility of using a distributed aperture radar to suppress mainlobe noise jammers, but not returns from nearby threats, by linearly combining the signals received by the multiple antennas.  The processing that we developed applies to dish antennas as well as to phased-array antennas. We applied the automated algorithms to simulated data of jammers plus targets, typically suppressing a single jammer by about 65 dB and two jammers by about 50 dB.  Most threat objects in the mainlobe, by far, are not suppressed at all by the same processing that suppresses the jammers.  The implementation requirements are similar to those for conventional multistatic and noise radars. In Phase II, we propose to develop prototype automated software that, by combining the signals received by a distributed aperture BMDS radar system, suppresses mainlobe jammers but not radar returns from nearby threats, and locates the threats.  To this end, we will refine and automate the algorithms developed in Phase I; establish their performance for BMD scenarios via simulation; demonstrate their performance on data collected by a distributed aperture radar system; and determine detailed implementation requirements for BMD.

The objective of this project is to use an innovative light-weight armor design methodology as a guide to IM solutions for large diameter solid rocket motors.  This armor solution will mitigate or reduce the violence of reaction in bullet and fragment impact scenarios by providing protection for the system while encanistered within shipping containers and/or canisters/launchers.  Bullet and fragment impact stimuli pose a significant threat to SRMs causing unacceptable reaction levels in the propellant.  Using common existing ballistic protection solutions can add considerable weight to the overall system and become a logistical burden requiring an increase in capacity for handling equipment as well as vehicles for transportation and deployment.  It is critical that ballistic protection solutions be light-weight while maintaining the highest level of protection for the energetics contained within the system.

Building on the successful Phase I effort, this analyzer will provide sensitive and accurate quantification of several chemical weapons agents through real-time measurements of high-resolution mid-IR absorption spectra.  The instrument will employ a novel cavity enhanced absorption technique that employs an optical cavity as measurement cell for significantly improved detection sensitivity, and mid-infrared quantum cascade lasers for high specificity, precision and low false positives. The Phase II instrument will be capable of providing rapid quantification of chemical agents and enable improved understanding of the dose-response characteristics of the subject in real time.",

This subsequent Phase II program is designed to enact a series of critical tasks that target a nearly 35% unit cost reduction and improved manufacturability of the DANR HPD. \u00a0By applying SBIR resources toward developing lean manufacturing processes for the DANR HPD, optimizing labor efforts, improving and automating processes and test procedures, and revisiting aspects of the existing design for BOM and labor reduction, significant long term unit cost savings are expected, in even low volume production. \u00a0The military and commercial viability of the DANR HPD product will be dramatically improved by the work of this Phase II program.  BENEFITS: There is a dramatic need for improved hearing protection and intelligible communications for aircraft maintainers in all branches of the DOD. \u00a0This Phase II program will aggressively seek cost reductions that lead to affordable procurements of new digital active noise reduction technologies in military qualified hearing protection and communications products. \u00a0Increased allowable exposure times for personnel in noise and improved mission effectiveness will be realized by the DANR HPD products at the conclusion of this program. \u00a0In addition, there will be collateral benefits to the cost and producibility of other custom earmold products (passive and communications earplugs) that are useful in a variety of military occupations. \u00a0Commercial sales opportunities for industrial noise control will also be enhanced by the expected product cost reductions resulting from this Phase II effort.",

Our sensor exploits novel features of AC electrokinetics, available only at the nanoscale, to detect signatures of TICs rapidly and with high sensitivity. The label-free approach eliminates critical difficulties associated with reagent logistics and stability.  During Phase I, we successfully demonstrated proof-of-principle of CFDRC\u2019s FIND-IT sensor technology. A judicious combination of physics-based analysis and experimentation was used to demonstrate that Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) can be used for rapid (~seconds\u2013minutes) detection of TICs/TIMs at low (sub-ppm level) concentrations. In combination, small electrode spacing and SAM modified electrodes can be used to obtain unprecedented sensitivity of detection (down to ppb level or lower). During Phase II, the design and performance specifications for the nanoimpedance based TIC/TIM sensor element will be further refined. The optimized sensor element design(s) will be microfabricated and laboratory tested to delineate sensor performance (in particular, sensitivity and specificity). Subsequently, an integrated FIND-IT sensor system prototype will be developed by integrating the sensor element along with CFDRC-developed and COTS micro- and nano- components. Integration and engineering will be guided by the need to develop a fieldable prototype with the constraints on hand-portability, ruggedness, remote operation and UAV/UGV mountability. The integrated FIND-IT sensor will be experimentally demonstrated for the detection of a suite of TICs.",

Currently, IO COA planning follows the process of traditional kinetic COA generation, evaluation, and selection, but without a means to effectively evaluate alternative COAs because of a lack of deep understanding of both intended and unintended targets. To address this deficit, we propose to design, develop, and evaluate a system for Linking, Indexing, and Validating IO COAs (LIVIO).  This effort consists of four key components.  First, we will extend our Phase I Work Domain Analysis to better understand the IO planning process and how analytic support based on human behavior models could improve COA generation, evaluation, and selection.  Second, we will develop a taxonomy for characterizing models from the perspective of the tactical user, and use that taxonomy to design tactically focused, adaptable \u201cmodeling objects.\u201d  Third, we will develop a system that uses the taxonomy and modeling objects to allow IO planners to rapidly generate, evaluate, and select IO COAs.

In Phase I of this program we have developed a new pulse programmer architecture that can support both trapped ion and solid-state qubit research by taking advantage of recent innovations in wireless communications and high-performance computing industries.

Shot noise is controlled by the high available output power levels from the source. Polarization control is provided by the use of a polarizing isolator.

        "abstract": "This proposal will provide immediate decision support data, enabling appropriate and cost effective responses (shut down vs. continue) for training exercises/facilities. Specifically, the DoD requires the ability to \u201ctrain as we fight and fight as we train\u201d, however training is severely limited by visible emissions compliance in the current regulatory environment. Regulated facilities will have the ability to measure, report, and defend their visible emissions compliance status. Virtual Technology LLC is the prime vendor for the Digital Opacity Camera System II and familiar with Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Method 9. Both of these solutions lack critical legal defensibility due to human judgment/interpretation, data latency and traceability, and certified user availability. Re-using its existing knowledge base Virtual Technology LLC (VTLLC) will engineer a means to overcome these limitations in the context of the current regulatory environment. VTLLC will deliver a systems engineering design combining multiple existing technologies, GPS, Surveillance, GIS, Met-e, etc. into a single sensor system. The sensor system will provide real-time decision support to responsible individuals regarding compliance status and probability of violation. The final sensor design will provide a mobile device measuring visible emissions and projecting both source and boundary line opacity values on a localized and networked basis. The design will be predictive in its nature accounting for changing environmental variables with the capability to archive the required compliance data set on demand. The most critical factor in the sensor system design will be the human interface to insure simplicity of operation with no to very low training requirement.  The Phase II HHRTCS effort will produce a prototype HHRTCS unit, and continue its testing with regulatory agencies to promote acceptance of the HHRTCS for visible emission opacity measurement under the Clean Air Act and related State Implementation Plans.   BENEFIT:   The HHRTCS will enable military installations, commercial companies and state and local governments who generate visible emissions to effectively manage these visible emissions to the benefit of the generating agency.  Further, the HHRTCS will provide a device that can accurately and effectively measure the opacity of visible emissions and store the environmental and climatic conditions at the time of the opacity measurement.  This capability will provide the \"most credible evidence\" of an opacity event and mitigate expensive litigation driven by the current manual record keeping and human interpretation method.  The HHRTCS system engineering design created in Phase I of this SBIR project has been endorsed by multiple stakeholders both within and external to the department of Defense and offers great promises to thousands of entities currently mandated to characterize visible emissions under the Clean Air Act.",

        "abstract": "Pursuits of highly efficient and reliable solar cells place high demands on the materials and processes used in their fabrication. For extraterrestrial cells, specific efficiency is of utmost importance, and thus the ability to reduce module weight without impacting efficiency is highly desirable. Flexible solar cells are a new direction in solar cell technology and robust substrates are required. Enabling technologies, including coatings and encapsulants for solar modules are being developed in parallel to provide benefits with respect to a broad set of critical needs including lowering weight, reducing manufacturing cost, enhancing durability, and improving efficiencies. This Phase II proposal addresses two critically essential surface treatments desired for space-based solar cells. One approach is devoted toward protecting the solar cell module from environmental degradation in space and the second one is related to enabling production of high efficiency cells through high temperature processing on metal foil substrates. Several solar cell manufacturers, developers and USAF prime contractors have been engaged in this effort with their firm commitment of resources for providing various materials, PV modules, and to provide testing services to validate the proposed technology. The proposed technology will be commercialized via strategic partnerships and licensing in Phase III.  BENEFITS: Wide ranging benefits to both military and commercial sector are anticipated from successful completion of the Phase II effort. Significant weight reductions and improving flexibility will have a major impact on the space solar programs for DoD and certain commercial installations. In addition, enabling CIGS-based thin film PV devices with high cell efficiencies and reliable performance will also have large scale benefits to both DoD and the commercial sector. With the current energy crisis and need for increased national security, the proposed surface treatment technology will have broad impact with respect to both improving cell efficiency and decreasing PV module cost. In addition, there is an increasing demand for portable and flexible PV modules for remote power access and the proposed technology will play an enabling role in bringing such products to the market place. Longer lifetimes and higher cell efficiencies for space-based solar cells will help enhance US national security assets.",

        "abstract": "The overall goal of this project is to develop a flexible acuity sensor (FAS), including both hardware and software, and demonstrate its ability to acquire and track moving targets in the environment, including when the sensor itself is moving. These sensors will utilize a proprietary Centeye vision chip capable of acquiring images at multiple resolutions and frame rates. The sensors developed will be production ready for commercialization. We will refine and harden the sensor firmware via extensive testing in real-world environments. We will integrate the sensor onto an air vehicle and perform two demonstrations: In Year 1, we will fly the FAS on a rotary-wing MAV and demonstrate the ability of the sensor to acquire and track moving targets. In Year 2 we will insert the FAS in the control loop of the MAV to demonstrate the ability to additionally pursue and possibly collide with the target. Primary deliverables include FAS sensors, a development kit with libraries upgraded enabling the user to create their own applications, and a wide field of view multiaperture imaging system based on these sensors.  BENEFITS: The technology developed will be useful for a wide range of applications in micro air vehicles (MAVs), unmanned air vehicles (UAVs), and robotics in general. The developed hardware will utilize a combined hardware and software approach that facilitates the detection and tracking of moving objects, obstacle detection, and general optical flow processing. When properly inserted onto MAVs, the resulting technology could improve obstacle avoidance adequately to enable autonomous flight down an urban canyon while avoiding both larger obstacles (buildings, full trees) and smaller obstacles (poles, cables, etc.). The resulting technology could also facilitate the detection of moving targets in the area such as persons, ground vehicles, or other air vehicles. The combined hardware and software approach will reduce demands on the image processor, allowing these capabilities to be ultimately performed with a weight budget of two grams or less per sensor. Note that our definition of \"sensor\" is a single board that includes optics, imager, processor, memory, and all other active or passive components enabling the board to act as a self-contained machine vision system. The same technology could be adapted for use in both ground and underwater robotics, for both civilian and military applications. Civilian applications would range from toys and consumer robotics (e.g. vacuum cleaners, etc.) to more sophisticated commercial robots. The development kit will allow an end-user to develop their own sensor firmware/algorithms and facilitate the integration of the technology into their own products or systems.",

        "abstract": "Chrome plating has been utilized as a protective wear coating for High Strength Steel (HSS) and Low Strength Steel (LSS) aircraft components for over half a century. High Velocity Oxygen Fuel (HVOF) tungsten carbide chrome (WC-Co or WC-Co-Cr) coatings are currently being utilized as a chrome replacement on many aerospace and commercial components.   Chrome plating and HVOF coatings are stripped using wet chemical baths at overhaul. Both processes require different chemical solutions that are hazardous to personnel and could possibly damaged the component(s) during the stripping process.  Phase I testing demonstrated that Force Pulse Water Jet (FPWJ) processing technique could in fact remove chrome plating and HVOF coatings from 4340 and 300M steel substrates.  Both hard chrome and HVOF coatings were successfully removed with no damage to the substrate, and maintained an excellent finish.  Further testing will be conducted in Phase II to validate the fatigue and crack detection characteristics of the FPWJ process.  Fatigue and crack detection testing will determine if FPWJ stripping process causes a fatigue debit, a loss of peening intensity, or covers potential cracks.  Recommended FPWJ stripping parameters and booth design will also be developed during Phase II.   BENEFIT:   The research discovered from removing chrome plating and HVOF tungsten carbide coatings on Aircraft, Engine and Propeller, and Landing Gear components will benefit the military and commercial world usage of high strength steel materials, such as 300M (280-300 KSI) and low strength steel materials such as 4340 (180-200).  The benefits of the FPWJ strip method will be similar for all Aircraft, Landing Gear, Engine, and Propeller components when implementing this system into overhaul. ES3 expects the following benefits from use of the FPWJ strip system on chrome plating and HVOF (WC-Co or WC-Co-Cr) coatings, based on both industry and in-house research: \u2022 Utilization of one FPWJ strip system in lieu of two separate wet chemical baths for the removal of both chrome plating and HVOF coatings. \u2022 Elimination of hydrogen embrittlement. \u2022 Elimination of arc burn damage. \u2022 Improvement of environmental concerns. \u2022 Elimination of relief bakes. \u2022 Improved process times. \u2022 Utilization of basic water (no abrasives) in a recycled system.",

However, there still remains a significant gap in experience applying these materials to practical devices. Closing this gap requires significant expansion of the knowledgebase of available material properties including the variability, reliability, behavior over time and range of operating conditions. In the proposed program, MSI will work closely with Weidlinger Associates, Inc. and material vendors to begin addressing piezoelectric single crystal application issues through a series of characterization, design and validation studies. WAI will work closely with MSI to develop a user toolkit to reduce the development time and cost required to develop new single crystal transducers.

Demonstration of this seven-fiber array begins the task of developing the hardware needed to scale Tm:fiber lasers to the levels ultimately needed for DE applications.

However, their utility for systems studies of missile fly-outs is limited by extremely long run times for each calculation. Spectral Sciences developed a data-driven algorithm suite for fast, accurate rendering of real-world plume imagery.  The FRAMES (Fast Rendering Algorithm for Missile Emission Scenes) model uses a small matrix of calculations along with field data plus innovative spatial morphing and field interpolation algorithms to enable fast frame rate plume imagery to be generated using a single PC over a broad range of missile and sensor operational conditions.  FRAMES is built around a database of precalculated high-altitude plumes that, for each missile type, span a range of angles of attack, missile speeds, and atmospheric conditions.  The completed Phase I program demonstrated the feasibility of FRAMES for scaling plumes above 110 km altitude to different angles of attack.  In Phase II we will extend FRAMES to the full missile trajectory, including automated calculation of the supporting plume database and generation of multiple images along the trajectory.",

        "abstract": "Presently the Marines use a wide range of handheld, head mounted, and weapons-mountable optical systems. These devices serve many functions; from visible and night vision imaging to target designation and ranging. Optical rangefinders employed by the Marines mostly utilize active laser sources. However, increasing use of warning receivers and electro-optical devices capable of detecting these laser rangefinders could put friendly forces at risk and/or allow the enemy enough time to egress or otherwise avoid direct fire. A passive range-finding instrument is desired which will provide a means for the Marine to utilize a single integrated optical device to perform multiple optical tasks \u2013 imaging, targeting, and range-finding. Nanohmics proposes to develop an electro-optical imaging device capable of determining the range to objects in a scene without the use of active emitters or multiple apertures. Called the Plenoscope\u2122, the device provides range information by measuring the differential parallax of a scene from multiple locations within the optical aperture. The Plenoscope can be adapted to visible imaging devices as well as infrared focal plane arrays, and is compatible with riflescopes, spotting scopes, and weapons fire-control systems. The result is an effective, inexpensive, usable, rugged, and maintainable optical system for the Marine.",

Innovative system design seamlessly integrates an electrically variable liquid crystal Fresnel zone plate, firmware, and digital display into a rifle scope/night vision platform to offer the Marine an instantaneous 3D map of all objects within the field of view. In Phase I POC conclusively demonstrated the system feasibility through assembly and testing of a proof-of-concept TRL 4 prototype capable of accurate rangefinding up to a distance of 143 m in outdoor settings. Ray-tracing modeling and simulations showed compatibility of this system with current Marine Corps scopes. Phase II will focus on developing a stand-alone prototype ready for field testing to qualify this system to a TRL 5-6. PASS-RANGE provides the Marine/warfighter a 50-500 m rangefinding capability with 1 m accuracy. The entirely passive system does not reveal the position of the Marine to enemy forces, significantly increasing survivability. Its robust design with no moving parts can endure harsh military environments, including temperature, moisture, shock, and vibration.",

        "abstract": "The standard Red phosphorus smoke munitions have excellent obscurance features, and have a much lower adverse health impact when used in training and field maneuvers. However there are some significant maintenance costs and health and safety concerns which have arisen during long term storage of Red Phosphorus obscurant munitions. During long term storage, especially when exposed to atmospheric moisture, RP munitions slowly convert to phosgene and phosphoric oxyacids. These types of chemicals are a severe danger to the personnel that have to monitor transport and maintain these munitions. These chemicals are also corrosive and can impact the security and performance of the munitions canister by corrosion. To resolve these adverse costs and environmental health and safety impacts, Powdermet demonstrated the feasibility of a safer replacement obscurant based on the use of pigment-coated sugar-oxidizer mixtures to replace RP and HC formulations. These sugar-oxidizer mixtures generate smoke without the hazardous byproducts and EHS concerns of currently used HC and RP smoke alternatives. The primary goal of SBIR Program is to successfully address the storage concerns that red phosphorus munitions have, by demonstrating (phase I), and then developing and qualifying (phase II) a sugar-oxidizer (SO) smoke formulation.",

UFS automatically creates and adapts Cartesian computational grids for arbitrary shapes and executes the analysis in an automated process, seamlessly coupling rarefied and continuum algorithms inside a single simulation system. This simulation system will provide the analyst with a push-button computational tool for generating a deterministic ensemble of steady and tumbling body aerodynamic datasets for fragments of interest. The deterministic collection of simulation results from this process will be utilized to formulate probabilistic fragment drag and lift models that can be applied in existing debris tracking modules. In Phase I, UFS was validated and demonstrated for subsonic to hypersonic and continuum to rarefied aerodynamics predictions, and a moving body capability was implemented and demonstrated for simulating tumbling fragment aerodynamics. In Phase II, the integration of the full 6-DOF tumbling body capability will be completed. The process of generating aerodynamic datasets for fragment shapes at combinations of Mach, Reynolds, and Knudsen numbers encompassing the fragment trajectory space will be established.

The Marine Corps and DoD use written technical manuals and Interactive Electronic Technical Manuals (IETM) to direct technicians through complex maintenance procedures for land vehicles, radar systems, radio communications systems, and ground-based weapon systems. Recently, the internet has made it possible to retrieve relevant maintenance data more quickly using computer search programs. However, technical documents are still time consuming to locate, tedious to use, and require substantial training to extract the appropriate data. Maintenance of complex equipment would greatly benefit from an intelligent, interactive system to reduce maintainer demands, speed maintenance, and improve repair quality. RMD, in collaboration with Dr. Steven Feiner (Columbia University), proposes a revolutionary new technology for equipment maintenance based on the fusion of Augmented Reality (AR) and Cognitive Augmentation (CA). The augmented reality maintenance system (ARMS) will guide the maintainer through complex maintenance procedures, from the identification of defective components to the detailed repair methodology. ARMS will be graphics intensive and interactive making it simple and highly intuitive to use. It will augment the abilities of the technician by providing the type of guidance normally associated with an expert human trainer.",

Although extensive preplanning can give the defender general guidance for a variety of enemy courses of action, the combinatorial explosion of possible ways an engagement can evolve makes explicit enumeration of all possible defensive responses to enemy actions impossible.  Ultimately, allocation of interceptors to threat tracks and generation of a feasible launch and intercept schedule are jobs that the defender must perform during an engagement, not beforehand.  The absence of an operational weapon/target pairing capability in the current and next planned version of the C2BMC manifests itself as a complicated optimization problem that must be solved in real-time by the human operators. Under Phase I of this SBIR, the DAC team has applied a break-through optimization technique to the weapon/target pairing problem that generates excellent weapon/target pairing solutions in real-time, and does so within the context of the current branch of the defense plan.

There is a need to structure software in such a way that it can most effectively take advantage of both the protection afforded by the secure hardware and also the computational power provided by the non-secure hardware. In this project, we addressed the issue of protecting high-performance embedded computing (HPEC) code by partitioning it as necessary to execute sensitive portions on anti-tamper hardware. We based our software partitioning approach on Reservoir's R-Stream optimizing C compiler. R-Stream uses an innovative loop transformation framework to perform mapping and optimization of C programs to a variety of high-performance computing platforms.

The manmade clutter can be non-Gaussian, non-stationary, and unpredictable. Second, the distance between radar and a target can be hundreds of miles, which make the radar returns very weak. Third, some target motions may be maneuvering, making the Doppler frequencies non-stationary and rendering the conventional techniques ineffective. Fourth, ballistic missiles may carry a number of decoys that confuse the radar detection.  We propose a high performance system that can address all the challenges mentioned above. Our system is comprehensive and includes clutter suppression, target detection, target tracking, and target identification. State-of-the-art algorithms will be integrated into our system. In Phase I, we implemented the proposed framework and performed extensive simulations to validate its performance. Our simulations showed that we can detect dim maneuvering targets even when the raw data have a signal-to-clutter-ratio (SCR) of less than -70 dB, which is a significant result.

Due to proliferation of inexpensive GPS jamming devices and emergence of anti-satellite capabilities, there is increased demand for sensor fusion algorithms which provide GPS-quality localization and are robust to GPS jamming, cutouts, and hardware failure. Our Phase I effort analyzed GPS/INS coupling architectures, and determined that feedback from a multi-sensor optimization algorithm can increase efficiency and accuracy of tracking visual feature locations or other variables related to a platform trajectory. This observation has resulted in a new functional estimation framework for vision-aided navigation. In Phase II, we will develop a testbed for design and evaluation of multiple algorithms in combination with different sensors and aircraft platforms. Our performance metrics will enable benchmarking against both simulated data and captive flight data.

This capability has not yet been matched, however, with automated detection systems. Search rate and\ndetection probability are currently limited by the capacity of human users to visually process and interpret video data rapidly.

Lynntech has conceptually proven an automated system, WAIRI, which acquires\nand analyzes thermal data over a wide field of view for PIW detection. The system continuously determines likely targets within the wide field of view and presents them sequentially to a human user at high image magnification for identification. Phase I scaled testing demonstrated 99 percent detection probability for a PIW in sea state 3 conditions at a search rate of 360 km2/hr. Additionally, the\nsystem was both highly resistant to solar glint and able to detect hypothermal targets. Production of a flight-operational system and\nlive, open-ocean PIW search testing will be conducted in Phase II.

        "abstract": "The Spotter Phase 2 effort augments the successful Phase 1 approach to provide advanced automatic target acquisition algorithms tailored to exploit large format (LF) imagery. 21st Century Technologies, Inc. (21CT) proposes a suite of detection algorithms specifically designed to address the challenges of wide area aerial surveillance and reconnaissance. Spotter automatically detects vehicular targets of interest in LF imagery using two complementary target acquisition approaches: a novel rotationally-invariant extension to Haar wavelet features, and a phaseless analysis of regional frequency content inspired by research in human visual search. \u00a0Spotter fuses acquisition results to build a georegistered target likelihood map to enable downstream exploitation. Successful LF exploitation yields superior operational performance and reduced analyst workload. Spotter combines the results of complementary detection approaches in a unique cascaded detection, aggregation, and fusion framework that builds consensus over all available inputs and detection algorithms to obtain the most accurate estimation of target presence. By doing so, Spotter will surpass the operational performance of existing approaches to wide area aerial imagery exploitation. Spotters capabilities can significantly increase imagery analyst accuracy and productivity, and can also provide the basis for an automated layered sensing system, further supporting the intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance mission.  BENEFITS: Large format (LF) sensors are being developed to provide wide area coverage at unprecedented resolutions. Employed aboard UMS or other aerial platforms, these sensors can support a variety of intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions. LF sensors present unique technical challenges, and their ever-increasing volume of imagery poses significant operational challenges to human analysts. Spotter automates the process of detecting vehicular targets in LF imagery, significantly reducing the volume of data presented to an analyst and increasing the operational value of the resulting intelligence product. LF imagery provides adequate resolution for trained experts to identify particular classes of vehicles, yet inadequate resolution for most current automatic detection algorithms. Spotter provides algorithms designed specifically for LF imagery which address the challenge of relatively low on-target resolution, as well as the need to efficiently process the large data volume. The detection performance of different approaches varies based on scene content and environmental factors. Spotter combines a suite of algorithms with a novel fusion strategy to provide robust detection performance in a wide variety of scenarios. Spotter can be applied in a variety of ways to provide military, non-military, and commercial markets the ability to locate and track vehicular targets in wide area aerial surveillance imagery. Military applications include improved image exploitation in surveillance, reconnaissance, and force protection missions. Non-military applications include highway surveillance and traffic monitoring. Additionally, Spotters geo-location of targets of interest provides the foundation for autonomous control of layered sensing systems, which is a revolutionary approach to the management of military sensor platforms. The structure of the Phase 2 effort maximizes the commercial attractiveness of our final capabilities. In addition to our core technology development, the effort provides compelling quantitative evaluations of the approachs superior performance using operationally relevant aerial surveillance imagery. Together, these provide a solid foundation for our efforts to commercialize and operationalize Spotter capabilities, and to secure Phase 3 funding.",

The planar approach modularizes and retrofits existing qualified solar panel technology with innovative shielding that allows a significant increase in survivability while maintaining the extensive flight heritage which is critical to implementation of new spacecraft power generation technologies.  The concentrator approach derives from previous technology development which has shown very high survivability and performance parameters and implements it with flight proven components.

Deuterium (atomic hydrogen) is introduced into the substrate or epilayer using Amethyst\u2019s proprietary hydrogenation techniques, chemically staining or tagging defects. Using nuclear reaction analysis or Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy the deuterium-tagged defect sites are mapped, providing key information about the health of the substrate and any process-induced dislocations and particulates which may have been generated during epilayer growth. When ultimately integrated into HgCdTe FPA process flows, AWM will provide IRFPA manufacturers critical feedback about the defects and causal relationships in their CdZnTe substrates, buffer layers and HgCdTe heterostructures - critical data with which to significantly improve both operability and yield of the FPAs they supply to the DoD.

The CLS includes a nylon fabric reinforced nitrile rubber fly-through cover. During stowage of the capsule, the fly-through cover can be exposed to seawater. The fly-through cover must seal the capsule interior, which houses a missile, from the external environment. Since the nitrile rubber is permeable, and the humidity inside the capsule must be maintained below a certain threshold, a Mylar\u00ae-tin foil-Mylar\u00ae low permeability barrier is installed over the nitrile rubber cover. This barrier is expensive, easily damaged, and presents potential debris concerns after missile launch. METSS has identified several coatings that adhere strongly to nitrile rubber and provides the required level of protection. The Phase I results demonstrate the technical feasibility of protecting the nitrile rubber fly-through cover with an organic barrier coating. The coatings provide sufficient protection to the nitrile rubber that no evidence of deterioration of the rubber was observed after accelerated aging in seawater at elevated temperatures, in comparison to unprotected rubber samples, which experienced noticeable degradation in properties. The accelerated aging data provides a good estimate that the projected service life requirements can be met through application of the coatings developed in this program. During Phase II METSS intends to develop these coatings to the point where they exhibit demonstrable long-term protection of the nitrile rubber fly-through cover.",

This technique will allow for the construction of a compact chamber that will facilitate hardware-in-the-loop testing of radars and seekers. The reflector used in the chamber provides a relatively large field of view but requires a small transmit array to simulate a variety of targets simultaneously.

DBF allows for improved adaptive pattern control for anti-jamming or interference control, high-resolution direction finding for tracking, antenna auto-calibration, ultra low sidelobes, closely spaced multiple beams, and flexible antenna resource management.  Recent advances in digital technology, data processors, and component fabrication techniques for wireless communication has increased the processing capabilities and drastically reduced the cost of DBF systems.  Thus, DBF is an attractive approach to enhance the capability of phased arrays for robust operability.   In Phase I, receive-only DBF concepts, architectures, and techniques were studied and developed.  Among several candidate DBF architectures investigated, an optimal architecture that can be incorporated into a multi-beam geodesic dome phased array antenna (GDPAA) was selected.

In addition to F-22, this technology would be applicable to all metallic airframe structural components and could include critical drive and propulsion system components that utilize residual stress-inducing material processing.  The introduction of residual stresses to increase fatigue life is used extensively in commercial aircraft structures, automotive applications, propulsion system turbines and mechanical drive components, and power generation turbines and drive components.  This represents significant commercial potential for a fully developed successful Phase III product transition.",

        "abstract": "The accident rate of helicopters immersed in a dust cloud represents a major contributor to loss of personnel and material in operations in a desert environment. Although measures such as approach profile changes and pilot training implemented to date have reduced this accident rate, it remains unacceptably high. Landing systems currently under development are designed to address this problem, but projected costs of these systems suggest fleet wide implementation is improbable. An affordable aid to the pilot promising a significant reduction in the brownout accident rate is needed. The focus of the program is affordability and reduction of accident rate, not to develop another landing system. The Bumper system consists of millimeter wave (MMW) radar and low cost GPS/IMU sensors providing pilots wideband, low-latency rate information and the relative position of obstructions adjacent to the helicopter. The system facilitates aircraft control allowing the pilot to position the aircraft as desired while obstacle information informs the pilot of areas he must avoid. While GPS/IMU sensor data has been in use in similar applications for some time and an extensive experience base exists, no such experience base exists for MMW radar, which is being addressed by this program.  BENEFITS: Successful completion of this program will result in a cost-effective system that reduces the accident rate of rotorcraft operating in degraded visual environments (DVEs). While the proposed system is not a landing system, it would provide pilots the situational awareness need to safely land or execute a missed approach in DVEs. It will benefit both military and civillian users.",

        "abstract": "Despite the importance of jet fighter afterburner designs, there exists very little data on the majority of the individual components of jet fuel, especially JP-8, to enable development of a detailed kinetic mechanism. Although the Multi University Research Initiative program has been initiated for that purpose, it is oriented for the main engine combustor where the process is different from afterburners. A kinetic mechanism for combustion in afterburners raises new level of complexities since the combustion is vitiated: low pressure, minimal oxygen, and high temperature. Innovative Energy Solution is assembling a world class team of experts in chemical kinetics and computational fluid dynamic to develop a robust and sophisticated chemical kinetics module for predicting elementary reactions of vitiated combustion as exist in afterburner environments. This module, for eventual insertion into a computational fluid dynamic package, will go beyond simple chemistry as it will predict relevant micro level chemical reactions during combustion in vitiated flow. Using the unique properties of the single pulse shock tube to generate the needed low pressure rate coefficients, the company is planning an array of experiments for cross-validating the model. Furthermore, the technique for reducing the chemical mechanism will be further refined.   BENEFITS: As the design requirements for aero gas turbine engines push the performance envelope, so does flame stabilization technology for afterburners. This work is part of the effort to develop efficient design tools to lower development cost and lead time for main engine combustors, afterburners, and even internal combustion engines. At the fundamental level, this project will provide a wealth of information on the chemical kinetic processes associated with JP-8 combustion over a wide range of temperatures, pressures, and flow conditions.",

This method offers no temperature control or assurance that the remains are properly preserved during transportation.

A full-size, operational prototype RHRTC has been designed, built, and tested in the Phase I contract.  The Phase I effort experimentally demonstrated that the RHRTC prototype can provide uninterrupted, accurate temperature control from either internal or external power sources, while meeting cost, size, weight and reliability requirements.  Internal power is supplied from common, easily replaceable, compact nickel-metal-hydride batteries in the electronics box.  The work performed in Phase I provides the opportunity to use the Phase II effort for optimizing the design, extensive testing and fielding production quality prototypes for field testing and evaluation by Army personnel.

State-of-the-art tracking algorithms will be developed to handle a wide array of stressing multi-target scenarios. These algorithms will be directly employed by our adaptable fusion architecture (named ADAPT) that was developed under Phase I of this SBIR. ADAPT enables the tracking algorithms to be dynamically swapped by either human-in-the-loop intervention or by an automated process. Finally, we provide a tool for estimating ADAPT\u2019s tracking performance based on track density in both kinematic and feature space.

        "abstract": "Current practice for machining ceramic radomes used in millimeter wave missiles relies on 20-year-old technology. The result of these antiquated processes is that the yield of machined radomes is unacceptably low and the time required to machine the parts is exceedingly long. These result because of the need for in-process part inspections that require the part to be removed from the machine tool, inspected in an inspection machine located remotely from the machine tool, and then realigned on the machine tool. This process is time-consuming and the difficulty in realigning the part in the machining fixture is such that many parts are scrapped before they are finished. Even parts that complete all of the machining steps are not guaranteed to achieve the proper dimensional tolerances. To overcome these difficulties, Creare proposes to complete the development of a Measurement and Control System for On-Machine Inspection and Tool Path Correction for the fabrication of ceramic radomes.

Several identified research areas for PML structure formation include but are not limited to:  extended direct current (DC), HPM, and H-Waveguide, UWB pulses. PML technology offers an alternative to conventional limiters and takes advantage of metamaterials and nanomaterials to accelerate this new approach into a device that will be easily integrated into RF systems.

        "abstract": "In the Phase 1 study, we have successfully developed and demonstrated innovative algorithms and software tools that (1) built upon space-based target tracking software, (2) updated with game theoretic framework to automate decision aids for collaborative system understanding to enhance system effectiveness and robustness. The proposed framework has several modules for realistic space surveillance operations: Data mining, data fusion, meta-task decomposition, knowledge base extraction and population, and GMAT based simulation and visualization. With this innovative structure as well as the incorporation of game theoretic models for target maneuver detection and sensor management, the space operations center can track multiple targets and adapt to the dynamic and uncertain environment in an optimal way. In the Phase II research, we will: 1) enhance our game theoretic approach proposed in Phase I, carry out expanded evaluation with more complex scenarios, and develop a performance metrics to automatically evaluate the space situational awareness (SSA) performance of our approach; 2) Improve the function of true plug-and-play so that it can be integrated into the SAFIRE test bed which is service-oriented architecture, as well as (3) advance the game-theoretic target tracking to incorporate threats and operational needs.  BENEFITS: Our first category application target will be the Space Situational Awareness Fusion Intelligent Research Environment (SAFIRE) program, Joint Space Operations Center (JSOC), and specifically the JSOC Situation Assessment Reporting System (JSARS). Beyond this first application, the proposed collaborative system modeling and analysis tool for SSA has potential in many military applications. Our industry partner, Lockheed Martin, has teamed with DCM on several Game Theory based developments because of the potential applications they see in major programs where they are the Prime Contractor. \u00a0In addition, DCM and Lockheed Martin are building a mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 program. We will leverage this relationship to identify the end customer, and work with these teams to transition our Phase 2 technology into their program. The DoD contact who knows the details of our work and who knows the above programs is Dr. Erik Blasch from AFRL. Other potential commercial applications include inter-satellite communications, multilayered sensing, disaster management, air traffic control, law enforcement, border and coast patrol, network intrusion detection, and business intelligence.",

By giving the designer realistic constraints as to what can be fabricated along with continued improvements in fabrication methods, large improvements can be gained in the properties of optical assemblies mainly due to the mass and volume advantages that are provided by the use of freeform optics.

Research advancements in metamaterials show promise in the design of high efficiency small antennas. Under this project, Applied EM is proposing to develop electrically small antenna designs using degenerate band edge (DBE) and magnetic photonic crystal (MPC) configurations. During Phase I, extensive simulation studies were conducted to design and build DBE antenna prototype achieving Chu-Harrington limit. Loading effects of lumped or distributed capacitive/inductive elements on DBE elements were also considered to overcome the fundamental gain bandwidth product limit. A key aspect of our Phase I work is the emulation of bulk anisotropic material properties using coupled transmission lines inserted into ordinary dielectric materials. Fundamental limits can accommodate size reduction of state of the art UWB arrays. During Phase II, we propose to adapt the metamaterial elements (DBE and MPC) developed under Phase I to realize multiband/wideband apertures incorporating wave slow down for miniaturization. Multi-arm transmission line coupled DBE/MPC antennas exploiting the newly achieved mode diversity will be also investigated to design wide and multiband conformal antennas which can also structurally integrated within the UCAV.",

        "abstract": "BDC is developing a process called SMART BLEND(TM) for inspecting blended IBRs/Blisks. IBRs are susceptible to foreign object damage and blending is a relatively low cost method using machining to repair that damage. \u00a0The difficulty is that blending changes the geometries of the blades so that they no longer meet specifications. \u00a0More specifically, blending changes the frequencies of the blades as well as their aerodynamic characteristics. \u00a0The proposed program integrates advanced methods for extracting information from engine tests, bench tests of damage components, new techniques for modeling aerodynamic and structural coupling, and advanced aerodynamic computer analyses to assess how blending affects the HCF life of a representative advanced fan stage from the F119 engine. \u00a0Initial results indicate that the proposed work would allow the safe repair of IBRs in order to quickly return them to service resulting in improved safety, enhanced fleet readiness, and lower costs.  BENEFITS: In this AF SBIR Phase II proposal, it is planned that the BDC/Duke mistuning technology will be adapted so that it will work not only for relatively small HP compressor Blisks but also for larger stages such as the 1st stage fan on the F119 engine. \u00a0Developing economical and safe methods for repairing 1st stage fans is particularly critical because of the fans direct exposure to FOD and its high replacement cost. Pratt & Whitney has agreed to partner with BDC in the proposed SBIR Phase II at no cost to the contract. \u00a0With Pratt &Whitney as an active participant in the program, there is every expectation that the capability developed in this SBIR will be transitioned to operational service to meet what are already important Air Force needs. \u00a0In addition, the latest models of commercial aircraft engines also use IBRs/Blisks. \u00a0As a result, the proposed technology has dual use potential in that it can also be applied to commercial as well as military engines.",

        "abstract": "High sensitivity HgCdTe focal plane arrays operating at 77 K can be tailored for response across the infrared spectrum. However, the cooling systems required to achieve the desired sensitivity makes them heavy and therefore unsuitable for the next generation of interceptor seekers. Reducing cooling requirements will allow the detector\u2019s integration in lighter and more compact systems. Superior operating temperatures can be reached with the employment of HgCdTe infrared detectors operating under non-equilibrium conditions. The concept is to suppress Auger recombination and the corresponding dark current in specially designed detector structures. The dark current is reduced by several orders of magnitude, along with dramatic increases in recombination lifetimes, dynamic impedances and detectivities. We propose to design and develop a high operating temperature (HOT) infrared array technology based on HgCdTe grown by molecular beam epitaxy. In Phase I, we successfully demonstrated long wavelength infrared HgCdTe HOT single element photodiodes. The efforts will be extended to 320x256 mid- and long wavelength infrared focal plane arrays in Phase II. The proposed technology provides sensitive operation at high operating temperatures, is compatible with multi-band response and large format technology, and therefore meets next generation MDA infrared seeker technology requirements.",

A smart wear coating, in gradient or layered composition, can be monitored as its property varies predictably with the remaining coating thickness. \u00a0Film life monitoring can be accomplished by observing the spectral response of the coating with a low cost light/photodiode package sensor.

Our vision for the Phase II project is not just to show that one company can scale up production of electrical fiber, but, more preferably, to start a whole new industry where any company can purchase a commercial nanofurnace, license the technology to grow Black Cotton, and begin producing electrical fiber and components using two-thousand year old cotton spinning technology.

        "abstract": "Aerius is proposing the development of a prototype hybrid coherent and direct-detection Ladar receiver for greatly enhanced detection sensitivity, target tracking and target discrimination.  The approach employs Aerius\u2019 Optical preamplified Pixel Array (OPPA) which consists of a 2-D array of Vertical-Cavity Semiconductor Optical Amplifiers (VCSOAs) that provide high optical gain and low noise to increase the sensitivity of photodetectors to near-photon-counting levels.  Aerius\u2019 approach leverages the OPPA\u2019s compatibility with advanced direct-detection and coherent Ladar receiver technology.  The OPPA offers near photon counting direct-detection while the inherent stimulated emission optical amplification process is consistent with requirements for extension of the approach to coherent detection.  The OPPA operates at room temperature, utilizes mature detector array technology, and enables system performance improvements while reducing system cost, weight, and power.  In Phase I Aerius demonstrated hybrid direct- and coherent-detection using our existing OPPA prototypes. In Phase II Aerius will demonstrate a full-up OPPA hybrid imaging receiver.",

This new paradigm for a gimbal design is denoted the Next Generation Gimbal (NGG) and yields a gimbal system that is lighter, uses less power, and exhibits better performance. The technology innovations that will be exploited in creating the NGG include: an on-gimbal IRU for precise and accurate pointing control and stabilization; an operating configuration that provides a drive system that does not impose reactions on the spacecraft bus; innovative mode logic and control algorithms to optimize overall mass, power, function, and performance; advanced gimbal subsystem control electronics hosted on flexible, small, low-power FPGA processors with characteristics suitable for space environments (including radiation environments); and material selections that are compatible with optical payload gimbal applications. A combination of these new gimbal design approaches, advanced technologies, and new control and operating philosophies offer great promise and allows ATA to reach the goals of SBIR Topic MDA07-008.",

        "abstract": "M4 Engineering proposes enhance the Phase I method for predicting store trajectory response subject to unsteady aerodynamic loads.  This method combines low-fidelity data with high-fidelity data in a novel way to represent the deterministic and probabilistic portions of the unsteady aerodynamic response.  This development enables increased efficiency in the use of test and time-accurate Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) data allowing for more accurate simulations to be calculated using fewer resources.  This technique will be an excellent compliment to modern test and analysis methods.  BENEFIT:   Demand for a store separation analysis tool that considers unsteady aerodynamic effects has existed for a considerable time.  RUSAT will satisfy this demand with a tool that is not only technically capable and computationally inexpensive, but is easy to understand and use.  The variable fidelity coupled analyses in the proposed effort will allow accurate and rapid prediction of the overall performance in order to avoid unpleasant \u201csurprises\u201d during vehicle development and testing.  Satisfying this existing demand will provides a tremendous commercial potential for RUSAT. In addition to store separation applications, the technologies of the RUSAT System could be valuable to other aircraft systems subjected to unsteady aerodynamic effects such as aeroelasticity.  Additionally, this system poses modules that are of use to any program where reduced order modeling or stochastic simulation is important.  The interest we have received from industry and other government sources indicates that there is a large potential for follow-on research and development activities, and this project has a high potential of reaching Phase III.",

        "abstract": "Existing approaches to guidance and estimation for intercept of maneuvering targets are often dependent on assumed models of maneuvering target behavior. We have shown in Phase I that intercept lethality can be dramatically reduced when an interceptor guidance strategy optimized for a specific maneuvering target type encounters a target whose behavior differs from that of the assumed model.  We then demonstrated in simulation the ability to augment a baseline combination of guidance and estimation with an adaptive element. Through rapid adaptation, the augmented system performs well against a variety of maneuvering targets.  The adaptive approach appears to be especially beneficial when the inceptor does not enjoy a large acceleration advantage over the target.  In partnership with Lockheed Martin, the phase II program shall (1) refine the adaptive approach developed in Phase I; (2) provide quantitative demonstration of improved or same Agile Kill Vehicle lethality compared to traditional guidance laws pitted against uncertain maneuvering threats in high fidelity simulation, and do so without dependence on models of target behavior; and (3) provide qualitative demonstration of the potential to further optimize overall system design by achieving a reduction in interceptor acceleration capability required to maintain required interceptor lethality against uncertain maneuvering targets.",

Current systems utilize cryocoolers placed on the gimbal, which necessitates the cryocooler heat to be rejected directly from the gimbal.  A superior approach in terms of payload mass would locate the cryocooler warm elements on the stationary platform near the spacecraft heat rejection system and place only cold elements required to cool optics and sensors on the gimbal.  On an SBIR project, Creare is developing an innovative cryocooler for gimbal-mounted sensors and optics.  The cryocooler is based on space-proven turbo-Brayton technologies which are being adapted to the unique requirements of this application.  The inherent attributes of the turbo-Brayton cycle permit the warm components of the cryocooler to be mounted off gimbal, which drastically improves thermal management and reduces payload mass.  The warm and cold components of the cryocooler are connected using custom flexible tubing, which has been demonstrated to provide the flexibility and life required for gimbaled systems.  In Phase I, we developed a preliminary design of the cryocooler and its components, produced performance curves, performed trades to establish a packaging and integration concept, and executed proof-of-concept fabrication trials to support the Phase II demonstration.",

The aforementioned capabilities arise from the requirement to: \u201cdetect, track and identify each and every potential object of significance in the target missile complex\u201d.   New advanced signal processing and adaptive waveform design and synthesis techniques developed by researchers at C&P Technologies have afforded a unique opportunity to further enhance the MDA radar performance without any modifications to existing radar hardware. Instead, these methods leverage the investments already made by MDA in real-time DSP and digital waveform generation. In particular, the payoffs from the proposed Phase II work will include a new real-time adaptive pulse compression technique that can extract very weak target signals that are masked by stronger nearby objects and which cannot be detected with conventional pulse compression methods.

However, measurement programs alone on domestic and foreign ballistic missiles cannot provide the level of characterization necessary to fully support sensor and algorithm development. Therefore the use of advanced computational models to provide threat signatures is critical to the design of sensors and engagement scenarios on all platforms. The current hardbody signature prediction methodologies in the Optical Signatures Code (OSC)contains physics-based models to account for the missile trajectory, aerodynamics aerodynamic heating and hardbody thermal response. However, several potentially important propulsion system and plume heating effects on the hardbody (e.g. plume-induced boundary layer separation, internal propulsion system heating, missile base heating, etc.) during the boost phase have been neglected. Thus, there are potential inaccuracies in predicted IR signatures which can lead to problems with interceptor design and performance. These issues are addressed in this Phase II SBIR, in which our principal technical objectives are to develop: (1) models to calculate the effects of propulsion system and plume-hardbody interactions on hardbody temperatures and signatures and (2) a Common Flowfield Solver for both body and plume flowfields which will be integrated into the OSC.",

In the discussion below, we present a thorough description of that capability objective. RAD\u2019s assessment of the NODDS technology during the Phase I effort has indicated a clear need to upgrade the NICS chamber to more modern infrared scene projection systems, specifically to the Optimized Array for Space-background IR Simulation (OASIS) technology.

        "abstract": "Upgrading a service in a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) can be costly and inefficient, especially since in SOA environments services typically depend on other services in a system-of-systems context. ATC-NY, together with Architecture Technology Corporation, will develop WIRE (Web service Interface Revision Environment), a system designed to efficiently manage version problems in a large distributed network of services. In Phase I we designed a framework for web service version control, created versioning support for WSDL, created SOAP translation components to translate requests from one service version to another, and created a prototype management system to efficiently manage a large distribution of services and assess the system impact by analyzing the services dependencies. We designed our framework to be extensible and scalable to many SOA enterprise environments. In Phase II we will create a full-featured application to aid service developers and administrators, develop support for other SOA interfaces and technologies, enhance the WIRE framework to provide more conveniences to end-users when services are revised, and test WIRE in realistic environments. We will also use Boeings InfoGlue framework as a test-bed. \u00a0This will help to provide commercial requirements and construct scenarios for use in demonstrations. \u00a0  BENEFITS: Using WIRE will decrease the expense and time required to maintain web services which work reliably in spite of changes to other services with which they interact in a system-of-systems environment. \u00a0In particular, WIRE benefits two roles of users: service developers and service administrators. Service developers benefit because WIRE allows them to smoothly maintain service version control (currently there are no standard version control systems for web services). Service administrators benefit because WIRE will help them to assess the system impact before launching new revisions. WIRE will do this by providing a visual dependency graph to show how services depend on each other and also providing helpful data such as usage statistics and domain information. \u00a0Thus service administrators will be able to make better informed decisions when deprecating or revising services. \u00a0WIRE does not depend upon any particular ESB software or require modifications to existing ESB components or architecture.",

In addition the PEOs and PMWs are responsible for simulation based assessments as part of the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) process. Accurate modeling and simulation of Naval and Joint communications systems is a key aspect of both process. The current state of communications modeling is to run engineering level simulation in NETWARS and then pass static data tables as input to multi-mission models such as that Naval Simulation System (NSS). This Phase II effort would lead to the development of a prototype modeling and simulation toolset that would closely integrate NETWARS and NSS and would allow for high fidelity analysis for the PPBS and JCIDS processes.

During the SBIR Phase I effort we have developed innovative geospatial data, tools, processes, and simulation techniques to automatically derive geospecific cultural lighting models and real-time representations. Our technical approach is driven by the assumption that today\u2019s remotely sensed night imagery lacks the dynamic range, intensity precision, spatial resolution, and broad availability required to support advanced night simulations, particularly in the sensor domain. Instead, the approach focuses on using night imagery, along with many other data types, to discern and/or predict the presence of specific types of cultural lighting at specific locations. Several core concepts were demonstrated and will be continued in Phase II: the extraction of cultural lighting types and positions from geospecific night imagery; the prediction of cultural lighting types and positions from commonly available geospatial data other than night imagery; the fusion of the predicted cultural lighting types and positions; the real-time rendering of high density, high dynamic range cultural lighting representations.",

        "abstract": "In Stability, Security, Transition, and Reconstruction (SSTR) operations, personnel from different agencies must effectively collaborate despite having different agendas, standard operating procedures, and desired outcomes.  Even in SSTR operations, which are fundamentally collaborative, experts in one particular field often have only a rudimentary understanding of other fields.  They are unaware of the right questions to ask, and have little experience finding answers to their questions.  What is needed is a common training resource that promotes knowledge-sharing and perspective-taking among multiple agencies involved in SSTR operations, through the introduction and application of expert-defined principles of effective SSTR operations.  This resource will be based on an innovative approach to scenario-based training involving important historical lessons learned, and will allow a diverse group of trainees to explore how similar events might have produced different results if handled in different ways.  To meet these challenges, we propose developing Training Collaboration in Interagency SSTR (TraCIS), a scenario-based training system that promotes interagency collaboration in SSTR operations.  The tool will go beyond teaching trainees linear, static rules for behavior to focus on key skills that can be applied across SSTR challenges.  It will promote a broader thinking process to facilitate interagency collaboration.",

For Phase 2, EYT intends to govern the refinement of components for IAE architecture by two fundamental principles: o User Acceptance i.e. Comfort through management of Micro-Climate o Protection \u00a0(Flame, Thermal and Water - through F/R Fabrics, Hydrogel Closure and Light Weight High Bulk Insulation)  BENEFITS: A low cost low risk approach to develop fabrics and textile components that help Reduce Thermal Stresses, improve Thermal Protection and Water Management properties using existing techniques and commercially available materials will have tremendous application in areas beyond Military application. Managing the Micro-Climate Domain of the user Layers of ensemble that are next to the skin and Macro-Climate Domain where external interaction is fundamentally more critical, and material and development approach could potentially save significant levels of investments and be applicable for protection for First Responders, Industrial Workers, Health Care Industry etc.. Furthermore, material technologies would also have great application in providing high performance clothing, beyond Military, in professional sports arena. Similar to Fighter pilot all EYT proposed IAE architecture where specific functionalities were designated into two main domains. \u00a0Engineered textile materials can help generate a truly comfortable ensemble for the user providing thermal and moisture management and chemical biological protection, which will have applications in all outdoors sports like - racing, X-treme sports protective gear and even provide home market access (light blankets for home). Such an ensemble system composed of multifunctional component technologies will reduce the risk of thermal injury or cold weather injury and reduce fatality rates. For the military application, Flame Retardant fabric, CB protective fabric, Low Thermal Burden System resulting in a comfortable and wear-and-forget system can be the basis of an integrated Aircrew Ensemble that enables application across all aviation platforms.",

Currently there are no commercial mechanical ventilators that will meet the specifications of this design based on the needs of the Tactical Combat Casualty Care doctrine.   The design for SAVe II based on the lessons learned from phase I will deliver increased flow from a new blower design along with expanded control options of Tidal Volume, Respiratory Rate, Positive End-Expiratory Pressure, and Peak Inspiratory Pressure. The SAVe II also includes a Breathe Assist mode for spontaneously breathing patients, ,lithium batteries to increase the operational time of the device  for up to 8-12 hours of continuous operation.  The overall design of the SAVe II lends itself well to be used on a day to day basis or stockpiled for use in the event of a major pandemic and can operate with room air, compressed oxygen, oxygen generators, and is compatible with currant draw over anesthesia devices.",

        "abstract": "High strength steel components on Navy aircraft are prone to corrosive effects of the sea water environment during long term use. Innovative low cost surface modification approaches can significantly improve the corrosion resistance of high strength steels without reducing their mechanical properties and wear resistance. An important component on the JSF is the Weapons Bay Door Drive System made from Pyrowear 675 alloy. The Phase I effort demonstrated that two low temperature carburizing processes (Swagelok SAT-12 Process and Bodycote Kolsterizing Process) can be successfully applied to martensitic stainless steels, such as Pyrowear 675 and Custom 465. These low temperature carburization processes produced surface hardnesses in excess of HRC 70 and about a 200-500% increase in wear resistance. The use of low temperature carburization processes could have a major impact on the cost and performance of components on various aircraft platforms including the JSF. The Phase II effort will apply the two low temperature carburizing processes to these alloys on actual JSF components. Work on the low temperature carburizing of 300M steel and optimization of the current carburizing process for Pyrowear 675 alloy used in the Weapons Bay Drive Door System will also be done.",

Currently no solution exists for slow cook-off that reduces the reaction violence or allows the large diameter solid rocket motors to achieve only a burning reaction. Systima\u2019s design concept thermally activates a case venting system for large diameter rocket motors during IM Slow Cook-off.  The case severance/venting system provides the necessary initial venting to significantly reduce internal pressure thus reducing chances of violent slow cook-off reactions.

ATK will provide technical information for system integration and representative motor hardware for concept demonstration tests including a live motor slow cook-off test per MIL-STD-2105C.

Despite major advancements in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques, prediction of the unsteady aerodynamic loads acting on the blades continues to be a formidable computational task. The accuracy of these predictions remains problematic. Accordingly, Techno-Sciences, Inc. (TSi), in collaboration with the Alfred Gessow Rotorcraft Center at the University of Maryland (UMD), proposes to develop an Advanced Rotorcraft Load Prediction (ARLP) tool for rotor and dynamic components that features combined analytical and experimental approaches. During the Phase I effort, we have focused on prediction correlations with Blackhawk flight test data in level flight and maneuvering flight modes, for which we have obtained very good correlation results to date. Further performance gains will be achieved in Phase II as the ARLP system is refined and extended. Sensor measurements (strain, acceleration, loads, etc.) will be used to derive airloads and constantly improve analytical load predictions to yield a combined analytical/experimental predictive tool. At the conclusion of the Phase II program, we will be able to use the ARLP to expertly predict the load/stress of the rotor and dynamic components that will benefit the Navy structural health and usage monitoring (SHUM) program for fault and fatigue analyses.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  We propose to employ a novel Boundary Element Method (BEM) numerical technique, demonstrated during Phase I, to develop a parallel computer code that will allow simultaneous solution, in three dimensions (3-D), of the vacuum magnetic vector potential and magnetic field structure for complex geometries. The primary advantages of the chosen approach are the reduction of the dimensionality of the problem from three to two dimensions, and the avoidance of wasteful computation of fields and potentials away from conductor surfaces of interest. The resulting code can either be employed stand-alone, for design purposes, or in combination with existing magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) or static magnetic diffusion codes based on finite-difference, finite-volume, finite-element, or even time-domain BEM techniques.  BENEFIT:  The benefits and applications of successful development of a 3-D code for magnetic fields and potentials are too numerous to catalog. However, of immediate utility will be more successful designs of high-current, high-power pulsed power devices and systems for directed energy and advanced energy applications. The resulting code will also be useful for a wide range of commercial applications that use magnetic fields, such as the recording industry, the medical community for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and proton cancer therapy, magnetic levitation for the transportation industry, accelerators for beam guidance systems, and university research.",

This capability satisfies an important requirement of dispersion analysis:  to understand the tumbling behavior that most fragments undergo.

HBP enables production of radiation-hardened integrated circuits at leading-edge circuit densities within any commercial silicon foundry, for use in both terrestrial and space systems. These methods do not adversely affect either circuit performance or yield. SST has demonstrated HBP as a solution to the major space radiation effects Single-Event Effects (SEE), Total Ionizing Dose (TID) & Dose Rate (DR) producing RH IEEE-1394B PHY and 16 Mb SRAM devices. Radiation testing of these devices has shown SSTs HBP approach significantly improves SEE performance (e.g., SEL, SET, & SEU), DR and has shown complete TID immunity to > 1Mrad(Si). \u00a0The capacitor will be based on structures previously used by mainstream DRAM manufacturers and will be produced using a modular add-in into TIs baseline process. Although Phase II funding is not adequate to produce this device, we will design and simulate the circuit to prove its viability. This will enable manufacture of RH DRAMs 4x denser than currently available and will demonstrate the feasibility of future (higher-density) devices.  BENEFITS: The first product design on the 130nm RH SDRAM process would be a 64Mb single data rate SDRAM. This chip would of similar size as our current 180nm 16Mb SRAM, but with four times the density. The exact configuration of the SDRAM would be determined based on customer input. This is a large enough SDRAM to gain market acceptance and, based on estimated cell size and TIs world class defectivity, should be manufacturable in TIs US factories. \u00a0Depending on the success of this product, other offerings such as double data rate and larger density memories could be made available. \u00a0The total dose hardness of the RH DRAM, based on recent results from the 180nm process, is expected to be about 300 krad(Si). Dose Rate and SEU performance is expected to be similar to the 16Mb SRAM.",

The proposed Phase II effort focuses on the development, implementation and demonstration of the RAPID-AN technology. RAPID-AN is built with an intelligent framework that can distinguish different traffic types and provide different levels of QoS based on the existing policy context, and ensure their end-to-end delivery. RAPID-AN also contains network coding mechanism to provide high reliability and high throughput for one-to-many and many-to-many communications. The network coding mechanism has been designed to counter the effects of high dynamics and high-speed mobility.

Mayflower will develop RAPID-AN prototype software in Phase II, and demonstrate its capabilities and performance on a heterogeneous radio test bed. Mayflower will, moreover, work with Airborne Network radio prime contractors to ensure the commercialization of RAPID-AN.

        "abstract": "The objective of this project is to design, implement and evaluate Next Generation Integrated Power System supervision algorithms that will support reconfiguration and damage mitigation by exploiting recent advances in hybrid systems control theory. The integrated electric power system is a cornerstone of the future naval combat ships. The future surface combatant family, including the DDG 1000 destroyer and the CG(X) cruisers, is planned to have integrated power systems. This new fleet of all-electric warships has power and automation requirements different from the combatants of the past. Analysis of the behavior of the power system requires consideration of the differential-algebraic equations that describe its continuous dynamics along with discrete switching actions that characterize protection system operation, load shedding and network reconfiguration. Thus, the management problem must be formulated in a hybrid systems framework in order to truly have a complete system description. The controllers that we propose will supervise the integrated power system to reconfigure a ship\u2019s power network following the occurrence of disruptive events and will provide other supervisory capabilities during battle conditions. The supervisory controller will be a high level tool that is capable of integrating inputs from prognostic/diagnostic systems, local protection systems, and lower level controllers. The project will produce associated design software that will include tools for real-time implementation and integration into shipboard power system control architectures. In our Phase I work, the validity of the approach was demonstrated in prototype software using appropriate benchmark scenarios based on the notional integrated power system that is derived from the DDG-1000 Zumwalt, the lead ship of the DD(X) guided missile destroyers. However, we emphasize the wide applicability of the supervisory control architecture and the design software to a range of defense, commercial and academic end users. The Phase II effort will be particularly attractive for the next generation of all-electric Navy ships. The software will be modular and easily extensible to accommodate the requirements of supervision and reconfiguration of such power systems.",

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase II project demonstrates a breakthrough approach to high-resolution linearity error compensation (LinComp) using computationally-efficient digital signal processing to reduce harmonic and intermodulation distortion in analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) by up to 24 dB. The core technology can also be used to reduce such distortion in digital-to-analog converters (DACs), sampling circuitry, and radio frequency amplifiers or the combination of these devices in the complete RF chain. This technology improves the dynamic range by up to four bits, enabling very accurate conversion of data at high intermediate frequencies (IF) with very high sample rates (e.g., distortion below -65 dBFS with 1.5 GHz sample rate, direct IF sampling at 1.2 GHz). The LinComp technology reduces the size, power, and cost of radar systems and RF transceivers by eliminating RF downconversion electronics. The highly innovative LinComp processing will be demonstrated in real-time FPGA hardware and fully tested with two different manufacturers\u2019 ADC chips (e.g., MAXIM MAX108, and Atmel AT84AS003), providing 1.5 GHz sample rate, 8 to 10 bit resolution, and direct IF wideband sampling in the second Nyquist zone. The LinComp processing will be implemented in a Xilinx Virtex 4 FPGA. Innovative parallel digital signal processing techniques will be used to provide the full 1.5 GHz data throughput by partitioning the processing into multiple, simultaneous data streams within the FPGA. V Corp has confirmed the technical efficacy of the LinComp processing methodology by testing with state-of-the-art analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters. V Corp has executed a highly successful DARPA sponsored SBIR Phase I project demonstrating LinComp\u2019s technical viability. This compensation approach requires less hardware, provides much better dynamic range, and provides compensation over a wider bandwidth than competing linearity compensation methods. Very importantly, the LinComp processor will always exceed the state-of-the-art because it is extremely adaptive and can easily be applied to new, higher performance ADC, DAC, and amplifier products as they become available in the future. V Corp has relationships with many commercial companies such as MAXIM, Raytheon, General Dynamics, Northrop Grumman, and others who have expressed strong commercial interest in LinComp (testimonials included in proposal).",

Phase I efforts produced a prototype simulation call the Multiple Fragment Impact (MFI) code that predicts SDT response for cased high explosives as a function of the number, interstitial spacing (space and time), velocity, and obliquity of the striking fragment array as well as the target design and properties of all materials involved.  Preliminary comparisons of MFI to CTH hydrocode during Phase I revealed similar critical velocity requirements for SDT response for two fragments impacting a cased high explosive target over a range of fragment masses and interstitial spacings.  The objective of the Phase II proposal is to provide the MDA with the BFA/ITT team vision for enhancing, integrating, and validating the MFI simulation.  Planned upgrades include the expansion of code capabilities to handle realistic payload geometries and configurations, additional fragment geometries (spheres, rod, and platelets), multiple explosive types, and run time enhancements.  An interface with the MDA Core Lethality Model the Parametric Endo-Exoatmospheric Lethality Simulation (PEELS) will be developed.  Additionally, ITT will oversee a limited test program designed to provide validation for the MFI code.",

        "abstract": "Detection, tracking, and identification of ballistic missiles can benefit significantly from improved correlation of the tracks and detections. Tracks and detections are coming from the optical sensors and the radar sensors for further fusion of data into the single picture of the situation. However, available association/correlation methods are not nearly robust enough. Several radar, EO, and IR sensor characteristics reduce the ability to match tracks correctly. Range and azimuth resolution, scale distortion, relief displacement (foreshortening and layover), and sensor shadow are among them. The objective of this proposal is to develop advanced, innovative, robust, real-time algorithms and software for the integration of passive or active EO sensor tracks or detections with radar generated tracks or detections. The solution uses metric data and features, provides a measure of confidence, identifies clusters of tracks when objects are indistinguishable, and can be implemented in a centralized or distributed architecture. The main novelty of the proposed EAD algorithm is in the use of robust and affine invariant structural relations built on the features for accurate correlation.",

In fact, since the end of the Cold War, the United States military has been involved in SSTR operations every 18 to 24 months. Assessing progress towards sustainable peace requires relevant metrics and the Measuring Progress in Conflict Environments (MPICE) program has made significant gains in this area. MPICE identifies stability indicators and related metrics for conflict drivers as well as the local institutional capacity to minimize those drivers. While MPICE provides a valuable systematic framework, there is a key technology gap in providing necessary insights and situation understanding with respect to meeting USG strategic stability goals.

During HEL engagement, rapid heating rates approaching 100\u00baC/sec are obtained. The BRDF of the target is extracted with msec temporal resolution, for interaction times as long as 120 sec. The heating caused by the absorption of the laser light by the target is numerically simulated by using the Optical Signature Code (OSC). Pyrometer and thermocouple readings show substantial agreement with the simulations, confirming the validity and accuracy of the code in modeling the laser heating of solid targets.",

Characterization of metal lined carbon composites during Phase 2 will increase the technology readiness required for insertion into a MDA project such as NCADE, AKV, or MKV. Metal lined carbon-carbon composites offer an unique way to utilize the heritage of metal thrust chambers while significantly reducing weight via the use of carbon-carbon composite structures. The metal liner provides known compatibility with propellants, such as HAN, and a reliable, hermetic seal enabling the use of light weight carbon composites. The metal lined carbon composite chambers are 90% lighter than metallic chambers and weight equivalent to carbon silicon carbide composites. The weight of interceptors must be lowered to allow programs such as MKV, KEI, and NCADE to be successful. This SBIR generates the data and capability to reduce weight of critical propulsion components to 10% of existing technologies while maintaining proven reliability. Aerojet, the Phase II/III partner, will provide component design and testing at its facilities.",

The development of effective MAVs for these missions will require the production of a real-time autonomous flight navigation and obstacle avoidance system for operation in complex urban environments which is suitable for implementation on these small vehicles. The flight platforms will have limited payloads which will require trade-offs in computational power and sensor type, including sensor resolution and frame rate. To conduct the obstacle detection and collision avoidance Radiance proposes a MAV flight control system that utilizes appropriate sensors in real time to autonomously construct a 3-D obstacle map, which effectively encapsulates physical objects within the MAV''''''''''''''''s potential flight path, and guide the MAV along a safe trajectory that positions the MAV for successful completion of its mission objectives. The geometry building algorithms are envisioned to provide the added benefit of geometric feature extraction and detecting real-time change within the geometry to identify non-cooperative moving objects.   BENEFIT:   Development of an unmanned system that can operate autonomously and effectively in real-time within complex and highly structured environments without Global Positioning System (GPS) reference or detailed knowledge of features or area details can be a valuable and heavily utilized source for providing information and data to support military operations, search and rescue missions, natural disaster (fire, earthquake, hurricane, et al) assessments, and much more.",

In Phase I we developed the system design; design of innovative aberration-free optics providing up to 20x zoom factor and a 60 degree FOV; development of a fiber-optics-based hyperspectral sensing module; and development of an image subtraction algorithm that eliminates hypercube redundancy and enables real-time operation.

Current reversible supercapacitors and batteries do not operate reliably and safely at extreme temperatures (-60 to +60 degrees Celsius) due to their organic solvent-based electrolytes. High energy density, high power density supercapacitors based on ionic liquid electrolytes and polymer electrodes can provide reversible, safe power systems for Navy air weapons systems, however ionic liquids that function adequately at sub-zero Celsius temperatures have not been developed. During the Phase I, Lynntech developed advanced ionic liquid electrolytes which showed high conductivities over -60 to +60 degrees Celsius and allowed reversible charging of electroactive polymer electrodes.

Previous work in the fatigue literature and at MetroLaser has shown that surface roughness can be a key indicator of the fatigue state of a component and that light scattering measurement is a convenient method for characterizing this roughness. However, there still exists a significant gap in the modeling capability due to the relative novelty of this technique. During Phase I, we showed the feasibility of developing a framework for interfacing between the sensed data and remaining life prediction in addition to showing the feasibility of integrating the sensor with different fatigue monitoring methods. With the basic feasibility of this prognostic paradigm demonstrated, the Phase I results can be used in the subsequent Phase II effort to refine the sensor design and develop remaining life models. The ultimate result will be a complete prognosis solution for structural health monitoring. Such a complete solution for sensing and prognostics would enable substantial cost savings in defense and commercial aircraft maintenance particularly. The compactness and low cost of the sensor technology makes it especially attractive.",

Every one of these measurements is expected to have a bandwidth in excess of 1MHz, as well as be able to survive not only the electromagnetically rich railgun environment, but also survive the transient temperature effects associated with use of the railgun. This need has arisen due to the extraordinarily intense and rapidly varying magnetic fields which are present in an operational railgun. In the instance of the railgun which is used at the Dahlgren facility, for example, magnetic fields of up to (or possibly even in excess of) 30 Tesla evolve over timescales of a fraction of a millisecond. As a result, any conductive material which is present in the environment experiences tremendous electromagnetic induction, rendering electronic based sensors a dubious proposition, at best.",

A tool is needed that can rapidly and accurately identify the relationships among the resource components that make up a terrorist network.

        "abstract": "Explosively driven pulsed power has developed significantly over the past few years in the form of Magnetic Flux Compression Generators (MFCG), Ferroelectric Generators (FEG), and Ferromagnetic Generators (FMG).  However, two critical areas still need to be addressed to make it possible to use these technologies in small munitions.  First, the generator output needs to be matched to the load in order to deliver maximum amount of power.  A second problem is that they tend to be sensitive to high strain loads.  This is especially true for FEGs.  Therefore, survivability of the generators after the munition is fired, but prior to activation of the warhead is critical.   HEM Technologies propose to address these critical issues with several solutions focused on FEG technology.  Power conditioning of a FEG will be accomplished using a proven high voltage output pulsed power system to match the FEG output to high power microwave sources.  Second, a compact attenuation system will be developed to protect the ferroelectric from the high shock loading associated with launching a projectile using conventional weaponry. The developed technology is expected to greatly increase the capability range of explosively driven pulsed power systems.",

        "abstract": "In Phase II, Infoscitex (IST) will focus on developing a Mobile Robot Seat (MRS) system that provides maximum protection, mobility, and accommodation to helicopter aircrew. In Phase I, IST successfully created an innovative concept for the MRS, completed system architecture and design, explored key technologies of the system, and evaluated its safety performance via modeling and simulation. In Phase II, we will further refine system architecture, design components and substructures (seat frame, seat bucket and cushion, and seat base), develop key technologies (impact energy absorber, pre-acting device, automatic weight adjusting device, and the restraint for preventing flail injuries), and complete system integration and prototyping. We will use advanced auto CAD in the structure design and optimization techniques to minimize the weight and to maximize the strength and crashworthiness of the structure. We will develop computational models for major components and substructures and build an integrated model for the entire system. We will use these models to simulate, evaluate, and improve the responses, performance, and functions of the system. Upon the completion of our Phase II effort, we will have a prototype of the MRS with major functions and capabilities, which is ready for technology transition and commercialization in Phase III.  BENEFITS: *Effective protection and restraint--By employing a pre-acting mechanism, the aircrew injury risk is reduced and safe impact range is extended. By automatically adjusting to the occupants weight, optimal force-displacement for each individual is achieved for the impact energy attenuation. \u00a0By using a four-point harness belt, the aircrew is well restrained at various positions (seated, half-standing, and standing) and is reliably secured while reaching out of the aircraft. \u00a0As such, effective protection is provided to the occupant. *Maximum mobility for the aircrew--By using a sliding track in combination with turning table, the aircrew can perform mission duties in the seated position within a 6 ft. diameter circle. \u00a0*Adaptable occupant support--A portion of the seat pan can be pitched forward to support the occupant in a half-standing position. \u00a0\u00a0*Improved seating comfort--This is achieved through optimized seat configuration and material and by providing adaptable support to the occupant in various positions. \u00a0*Full range anthropometric accommodation, from 5th % female to 95th % male--This is realized by (a) Using automatic weight adjusting device to obtain optimal force-displacement profile for different occupant weight; (b) Appropriate seating space design; and (c) Adjustable harness belts. *Rapid position transition--By using extensible harness belt and adjustable seat pan, the aircrew can quickly change body postures among seated, half-standing, and full standing. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*System integration readiness--The seat can be mounted on to the floor with existing structure or minimal modifications. To yield space, the seat can be stowed, pushed aside in any direction, or removed from the track. *The target customer rotorcraft is the CSAR-X. However, this seating system can be equipped in a wide fleet of military helicopters as an aircrew seat, such as V-22, CH-46, H-47 (CH-47), H-53, SH-60, UH-60, HH-65, and H-3/CH-3, C-130J, and NASA Orion capsule. It can also be used in civilian rescue and law enforcement helicopters.",

        "abstract": "FPGA-based reconfigurable systems'''' popularity for space-based applications has grown considerably due to their flexibility and the ability to multiplex in real time different hardware configurations. \u00a0A wider utilization of COTS FPGAs is limited by their susceptibility to Single Event Upsets (SEUs). A practical method to mitigate SEU upsets on FPGA-based systems will significantly impact the aerospace industry. This phase II project will implement and test a scrubbing solution designed at Micro-RDC during the phase I. The scrubber consists of an application specific microcontroller labeled Femto Controller. Femto is designed to support a limited set of instructions mainly dedicated to move data to and from the configuration memory (or any memory in general). Due to the programmability of Femto, the scrubber is flexible enough to support different Xilinx families as well as different configuration memory access ports. The prototype resulting from this phase will be implemented on Structured ASICs using \u00a0the Structured ASIC Rad Hard By Design (RHBD) IBM 9LP library and a design flow developed at Micro-RDC. This prototype, as well as the scrubber netlist for implementation on a programmable device will be at the core of the commercialization strategy for the next phase of this effort.  BENEFITS: The scrubber has a direct impact on military and aerospace applications. Its success will allow designers to work with COTS with some level of reliability without having to incurring in the excessive cost of using radiation hardened devices. If successful this solution could be used in any digital system susceptible to SEUs with little or no modification. In particular, a Plug and Play variation of the scrubber solution provides support for legacy hardware at little cost.",

        "abstract": "Surface Optics Corporation (SOC), teamed with Pratt and Whitney (P&W), is proposing an innovative solution for operational monitoring of the health of Ceramic Matrix Composite (CMC) Thermal Barrier Coatings (TBC) on jet engine turbine blades. \u00a0The proposed Phase II effort will produce a high speed endoscopic SWIR (0.9 - 1.7 micrometers) radiometer able to monitor in real time the condition of the CMC coatings on each and every blade in the turbine. \u00a0This solution is based on extensive work performed by both team members that has been directed towards problems of similar nature over many years. \u00a0The problem is that turbine blades are nickel-based superalloys with a CMC thermal barrier that protects them from temperatures as high as 4000 deg. F (the melting point of the steel is ~ 2900 F). \u00a0The role of the CMC layer is to assure that the temperature of the steel blades does not exceed ~ 1700 F. \u00a0Premature (occurring before routine scheduled maintenance) degradation or failure of the CMC blanket can lead to engine failure. \u00a0Our team solution is to apply proven SOC real-time hyperspectral imaging with continuous automated analysis and reporting of the health of the blade CMC coatings.

The receiver will ultimately be used with modulated (0.5 \u2013 1.0 GHz) blue-green pulsed lasers and is required to have an active detection area of at least 8 mm, as well as high QE in that wavelength region. The main challenges are to design a compatible receiver module that has a fast response time combined with high sensitivity, low noise characteristics and a high enough dynamic range. High dynamic range is required to accommodate weak returns from low reflectance targets at multiple attenuation lengths, as well as higher energy returns from stronger reflectors closer to the receiver. Utilizing high speed digitization, the design allows for flexible digital processing and demodulation.",

        "abstract": "Mayflower Communications Company, Inc. (Mayflower) proposes a Topology Management & Control (TM&C) technology, the Real-time Optimal Management of Airborne Network Topology (ROMANT), to meet the Air Force objective, namely, to develop an approach for dynamic network topology management and control. The proposed Phase II effort focuses on the development, implementation and demonstration of the ROMANT TM&C technology. ROMANT TM&C enables dynamic Topology Management & Control with minimal signaling overhead. The ROMANT system continuously discovers and assesses the current topology, determines how it could be optimized, and then controls the network resources to achieve this optimal topology. ROMANT technology uses efficient distributed algorithms for topology assessment and optimization. ROMANT technology is designed to provide reliable and dynamic TM&C in a network whose nodes are widely varying in capability, capable of high dynamics and high-speed mobility. The ROMANT system, which has been proven feasible in the Phase I study for the Air Force application, has enormous potential for military and commercial applications. Mayflower will develop ROMANT prototype software in Phase II, and demonstrate its capabilities and performance on a heterogeneous radio test bed. Mayflower will also work with Airborne Network radio prime contractors to transition ROMANT TM&C in Phase III.  BENEFITS: By providing dynamic topology management & control, ROMANT can help complex tactical networks such as the Air Force Airborne Network and the Army Warfighter Information NetworkTactical (WIN-T) achieve high level of performance, and thus be a key enabler in Network-Centric Warfare. In the commercial arena, ROMANT can enable efficient networking for metropolitan heterogeneous networks consisting of diverse wireless devices such as WiFi, WiMAX, Bluetooth and 3G cellular. ROMANT can also provide dynamic topology management and control services for first responder networks, and therefore enable efficient setup and management of such networks in disaster recovery scenarios.",

        "abstract": "The overall goal of this proposed program (through Phase III) is to build a hand-held Raman analyzer that can perform non-contact identification and hazard classification of chemicals in the field.  This will be accomplished by building an exceptionally small interferometer, and producing a field-worthy, hand-held Raman analyzer that is less than 6x6x4\u201d and 8 lbs.  The Phase I program demonstrated feasibility by measuring 50 chemicals using laser excitation at 785, 976, and 1064 nm and establishing that fluorescence occurred for both 785 and 967 nm in many samples, but none at 1064 nm.  Furthermore all chemicals, including TNT, could be identified in 10 seconds. The objective of the Phase II program is to build a hand-held Raman analyzer prototype to perform the desired measurements.  This will be accomplished by building a new, extremely compact interferometer, and producing a hand-held Raman analyzer that employs 1064 nm laser excitation through a 10-15 ft extendable fiber optic probe, and is 7x6x6\u201d and weighs 10.5 lbs (4.8 kg).  The design allows for continued decrease in size.

The antenna utilizes a hybrid active/passive architecture that minimizes T/R module count and total power consumption for equivalent radar capability, while maintaining full ESA steering capability. The ESA electronics are also unique by virtue of using discrete devices bump-bonded onto low-cost substrates. This reduces cost by increasing T/R module yield. The devices themselves, utilize a mix of technologies that have been optimized for power-efficient operation.

        "abstract": "PRESAGE is a robust computational tool that employs artificial neural network machine learning technologies to automate the analysis of extremely large sets of unstructured information. The PRESAGE solution takes a broad view of unstructured information analysis, learning correlations between on-the-ground threat risk and trends in sentiment, themes, and other textual features extracted from large amounts of open source information. PRESAGE uses this learned knowledge to detect emerging threats from changing sentiment extracted from newly acquired information. This provides the situational analysis that enables troops to take a proactive stance and conduct operations when, where, and how they will be most effective. In the PRESAGE Phase I effort, 21CT demonstrated the effectiveness of a neural network based approach to threat risk estimation. The results are significant for the future development of PRESAGE technology. We have proven the concept that recurrent neural architectures can be used to estimate information analogous to threat levels from sentiment and theme features extracted from unstructured data. We believe this technology can also be used to estimate threat risk if applied to wide-area OSINT sources. We have identified critical research questions that need to be addressed by future work for successful application of PRESAGE to operational scenarios.",

We extracted and catalogued learning objectives, became familiar with the usage and implementation of the MPICE software tool and database, designed the MPICE-ITS software and eight representative exercises.  In addition, we developed limited software prototypes to illustrate our instructional approach, and we used the DataMontage time-oriented data visualization tool to present multivariate MPICE data more compactly to support more effective data exploration and review.

        "abstract": "In traditional GMAW and modifications, the current melting the wire is the same as the current heating the base metal. To maintain a minimally acceptable productivity, the base metal heat input is typically much greater than the required to control the distortion at an acceptable or desirable level. In the modified GMAW proposed, a bypass torch is added to an existing GMAW system to bypass part of the current so that the base metal current is smaller than the wire melting current. By controlling the bypass current, the base metal current can be controlled at its desired level while the melting current can also be controlled at its own desirable level. As a result, reducing heat input thus distortion and increasing travel speed can be achieved simultaneously. While the Phase I project has proven the feasibility, this Phase II project will develop a commercial prototype system to implement the technology; establish optimal weld procedures to minimize post-weld distortion, as measured at selected representative locations, and total welding time for selected shipyard applications; adaptively control the process to assure the production of quality welds with minimized distortion and welding time; demonstrate the technology at shipyard; and generate technical data for qualifications.",

        "abstract": "It is well-understood that actuator nonlinearities, such as free-play, can induce limit cycle oscillations (LCO) in otherwise stable closed-loop systems.  In flight control systems, free-play specifications are set conservatively in order to preclude free-play-induced LCO.  However, conservative free-play requirements can increase the manufacturing cost of actuators and give rise to a costly program of regular inspections.  Given the impracticality of experimentally determining appropriate free-play limits, an analytical method to safely relax free-play specifications could reduce actuator manufacturing and lifecycle costs.   Importantly, in addition to accurate aeroelastic modeling to predict LCO, proven adaptive control methods exist to mitigate the effects of uncertain actuator nonlinearities, such as free-play.  Thus, maximum benefit would be derived from a tool that combines improved aeroelastic modeling that explicitly addresses uncertainty effects with adaptive control techniques to relax free-play criteria and mitigate the adverse closed-loop effects of actuator free-play. Barron Associates, Inc., ZONA Technologies, Inc., Dr. Earl Dowell, and Dr. Gang Tao propose a Phase II effort that leverages team members'' expertise in aeroelastic modeling and adaptive control in the presence of uncertainty to develop and demonstrate Advanced Modeling and Control for Aeroservoelastic Design (AMCAD) - a software tool to facilitate the case-by-case analysis of free-play specifications.     BENEFIT:   Improved techniques for understanding the effects of uncertainty, free-play, and adaptive control on aeroservoelastic stability have potential applications to most air vehicles, including military fixed-wing aircraft, UAVs, and commercial and general aviation aircraft.  Thus, the AMCAD Toolbox and the underlying technologies will have widespread military and commercial applicability.",

        "abstract": "Omega Optics and the University of Texas at Austin propose an innovative approach to build a high speed (40GHz), highly linear electro-optic (E-O) modulator (spurious free dynamic range (SFDR)>121dB/Hz) based on domain inverted Y-fed directional coupler using advanced E-O polymer materials developed by DARPA MORPH program. The proposed structure with inverted domains, which has an opposite poling direction with respect to each other, can potentially eliminate the nonlinear response of the modulator due to the fact that the higher order spurious signals are cancelled out in each adjacent domain. The bandwidth of the proposed linear modulator can be enhanced to 40GHz using a traveling wave electrode, which will surpass any state-of-the-art linearization technologies. Furthermore, the symmetric waveguide structure of the Y-fed directional coupler will be intrinsically bias-free providing the linear modulator at 3-dB point regardless of the ambient temperature. This feature ensures the linear modulator insensitive over a large temperature operation range with minimized harmonic distortion.  In the Phase I program, we have laid a solid foundation by demonstrating necessary fabrication processes and prototype linear modulators with lumped electrodes. These progresses include high efficiency E-O poling (r33=56pm/V in active EO device) on AJLS102/APC, reactive ion etching (RIE) and high precision photolithography. A distortion suppression of 65dB on a two domain modulator is also demonstrated. The advanced E-O polymers developed through the sponsorship of the DARPA MORPH program, will be fine-tuned to provide remarkable features to our proposed modulator in terms of lower driving voltage, lower insertion loss and better noise figure. In the Phase II program, we will also conduct in-depth investigation of device physics such as the interaction between the traveling wave electrode and the optical waveguides. The outcome of such studies will assist us to enhance the performance of the device in microwave and millimeter wave frequencies. Device engineering and packaging issues will also be addressed to ensure the demonstration of a fully packaged polymer linear modulator. Application of such a linear modulator in RF photonic transmission system will be explored as well, with emphasis on power margin and noise figure of the entire system.",

        "abstract": "The ability to rapidly prototype investment casting cores suitable for single crystal turbine blade casting was demonstrated in the Phase I program. \u00a0Successful commercialization of this process requires several follow-on efforts: (1) improving process throughput and yield, (2) tailoring core strength and stability as required for single crystal or equiaxed casting processes, (3) understanding the source and magnitude of component-to-component variability and development of the capability to manufacture advanced cooling designs, (4) developing process improvements to reduce the cost and complexity of maintaining airfoil shapes and tolerances, and (5) improving the leachability of cores. Each of these topic areas represents an opportunity for improving the economics and market viability of the process and associated components. These efforts will allow the overall time and cost required to rapidly produce a core from an electronic design to be minimized. It is strongly anticipated that at the culmination of this Phase II effort, all of the necessary understanding, processes and techniques will be in place to begin offering core prototyping services to customers. Depending on the Phase II results, core removal services (leaching) for the resultant castings would also be offered as a part of the core prototyping service. \u00a0  BENEFIT: The successful commercialization of this technology will allow for the rapid design and iteration of investment casting cores. More specifically, it will enable the rapid design and manufacture of cores for rotating and static castings for aircraft turbine engines. It is anticipated that this technology will enable rapid iteration of cooling schemes and that the typical 6-9 month lead time for production of a core from an electronic design can be reduced to about one week. \u00a0In addition to the reduced manufacturing time, this new process allows for several different engine sets of cores to be produced for todays cost of a single core die. As such, this technology provides the ability to more fully validate design models and to test multiple cooling schemes as part of the engine development process. Furthermore, core designs which are currently impossible or extremely difficult to produce become readily feasible, thus opening up a new realm of cooling schemes. \u00a0Initially, the business will provide rapid prototyping of cores, and (as required) leaching services for castings. The initial target market is investment casting cores for military turbine engine development programs. The intended customers are all engine and component manufacturers who participate in such programs. It is intended that this rapid prototyping technology will mature into a production process that is economically capable of providing cores for production castings.",

Our response has included persistent surveillance and electronic warfare to defeat Radio-Controlled IEDs. The CREW Duke system developed by SRC has been a phenomenal success in jamming RC-IEDs and has saved countless lives. RF signal characteristics and vehicle positions are recorded for post-mission analysis in logs that provide a sampling of the RF environment and history of U.S. convoy movements. Long-term GMTI radar detections of moving targets are also being recorded to support manual forensic analysis. In Phase II, TSC and SRC propose to develop and demonstrate algorithms to fuse data from GMTI radar and CREW Duke logs to predict IED attacks so that convoys can be warned to avoid high risk areas or change their operating procedures. In Phase I, TSC tested our existing anomalous movement detection algorithms using measured radar data, and SRC applied a Depedency Analysis technique to collected CREW Duke logs. In Phase II, our team will identify the best combination of information on target movement, RF environment and geospatial factors to predict IED attacks. \u00a0We will develop and demonstrate a fusion algorithm to reliably predict attacks, and recommend radar and CREW improvements to enhance performance. \u00a0  BENEFIT: This technology can alert U.S. military convoys to potential IED attacks in time to choose alternate routes or change operating procedures. Our team plans to build a fully automated system that retrieves CREW Duke mission logs and sends these to a central processor for fusion with GMTI radar data and intelligence reports, and then provide alerts to ground commanders. The technology can also be applied to combine radar, electronic intercept, and other sensor data to enhance border security and improve criminal surveillance.",

These materials will have high density to enable direct substitution of an energetic material for an inert material, high strength to survive severe shock loading conditions, and high energy content to increase the effectiveness of a weapon system. This effort will combine our unique expertise in instrumented-Hot Isostatic Pressing (HIP) with new approaches in composite design to develop a new generation of cost-efficient, high-density, high strength reactive composites. The proposed material system will use a blend of elemental powders which can yield a fully dense composite with a density of 7.8 g/cc or higher. The powders will be consolidated to full density to maximize the load-carrying capability of the composite, including strength and ductility. The consolidation will occur below the reaction initiation temperature to prevent any energy release during compaction. The existence of different powder materials will allow for tailoring of the mechanical and reactive properties of the material by varying the volume fraction of each element. Upon successful demonstration, this powder-based process can be easily applied to different powders and scaled for cost-effective, high volume production of powders and fully dense composites.",

Tantalum carbide (TaC) based materials are being developed for potential employment as nozzle liners in axial thrust motors due to their ultra-high temperature capabilities.  Plasma Processes, Inc. has optimized vacuum plasma spray (VPS) techniques to fabricate dense TaC based components.  Although, property and microstructural studies of VPS Ta4HfC5 and Ta55C45 appear very promising, basic relationships between microstructure, processing and mechanical behavior are still poorly understood.  In order to elucidate these basic relationships and offer insights for tunable microstructure deformation property control, additional detailed analytical microscopy studies are warranted.  Previous manufacturing efforts have demonstrated the survivability of subscale nozzles consisting of a thin VPS TaC-based liner with a VPS rhenium (Re) support jacket.  Alternatives to Re, such as Ta10W, are needed to reduce costs, however further studies are needed to increase the manufacturing readiness level of VPS Ta10W.

        "abstract": "We propose to continue developing a potentially revolutionary technological innovation: advanced coatings that will significantly increase the efficiency, lifetime and reliability of gas-turbine engines. In addition, these coatings can be applied to a range of existing and future military hardware that require protection from harsh environments. Despite the tremendous improvements in coating technologies to enable huge increases in operational temperatures, continued advances using conventional, purely materials-science approaches have resulted in diminishing marginal returns in the last 25 years. The problem is that the turbine blades heat up as a result of conductive and radiative heat transport. Using various fabrication methods, we will develop techniques to imbed structure within thermal-barrier coatings (TBCs) that will decrease their thermal conductivity by a factor of 2, thereby attenuating phonon transport of heat and providing the means to (1) increase turbine-blade lifetime by 10X and (2) attain considerably higher operating efficiencies by operating the engines at significantly higher temperatures (500 degrees F higher than present technology). These revolutionary improvements will save the government several billion dollars annually as a result of lower operating cost and cost-of-ownership of our military assets. In Phase II we will test and demonstrate systems that are designed to minimize heat transport in materials that are appropriate for TBCs.",

BENEFIT: The SiGe digital imaging sensors are ideally suited for replacement of image intensifier tubes in night vision goggles and devices.

Moreover, the extended spectral coverage of the SiGe digitial imaging sensors beyond 2.0 \u00b5m opens up new applications in covert imaging heretofore impossible with legacy SWIR imagers. The SiGe digital imaging sensors will also be critical in supporting military operations in modern urban and cave warfare, either as standalone sensors or in combination with MWIR and LWIR sensors. The radical cost reduction will make it possible to equip every soldier and every vehicle with an imaging camera.

As a result, it is nearly impossible to effectively and efficiently identify, generate, extract, and track LVC performance data, thus hindering efforts to assess trainees performance during LVC training events and exercises. To address these issues, we will develop the System for Tracking, Assessing, and Standardizing Human-performance (STASH). STASH will enable the development, analysis, and usability of integrated performance measures from LVC environments in support of performance assessment and review by achieving: (1) a universal tagging specification for extracting LVC data into performance measures; (2) an integrated warehousing system for performance measures; (3) a common method for identifying the data type (system, observer, communication) and source (LVC) needed to produce useful and integrated performance assessment; and (4) an integrated LVC Dashboard for defining and identifying training objectives, and the associated scenario and performance measurement elements required to fulfill those training objectives, and then presenting the resultant integrated performance assessments to instructor/observers.

        "abstract": "The prototype for this Phase II SBIR fundamentally provides a way to assure that objectives will be reached given sufficient resources. \u00a0This assurance comes from numerous sources. \u00a0First, an on-time application provides the means to schedule and dispatch computing resources such that system priorities will be observed. \u00a0Second, using a Linda spaces framework provides the means to avoid latencies and to scale computational resources. \u00a0Third, the use of an enterprise service bus that incorporates not only translation of data to standard interfaces but also translation of protocols to standard protocols provides a basis for creating interoperability at the heart of the system. \u00a0Fourth, decoupling the cross-domain guards from application details allows the creation of guards that do not need to be re-accredited when applications and system change. \u00a0Fifth, the modularization of the system allows the parts of the system to be replaced by alternatives that are appropriate for the level and kind of service the system requires. \u00a0Last, the speed and intelligence of the system is not only balanced by its flexibility to deal with a variety of different communication circumstances but also by the guarantee that there will be very high data integrity and auditing of the process.  BENEFIT: Topia''''s current commercialization plans include: \u00a0&#61601; Licensing of both the turnkey SOA solution and its sale-able individual components; and \u00a0&#61601; Design and development of custom applications built on the stack. Topia has identified customers of these products in two forms: resellers and enterprises. Resellers of the technology would largely take the form of lead system integrators (LSI) for large-scale government integration efforts, many of which are experiencing difficulty in implementing effective SOA systems and many more of which are yet to be funded. \u00a0For non-government implementations, Topia will concentrate on sales to enterprises (here, large companies, non-profits, or academic organizations). Both groupsresellers and enterpriseswill be customers of licensed and customized products. \u00a0Anticipated benefits for mission-critical information sharing systems include: \u00a0\u00a0-quality assurance -hot failover -linear scalability -security -modularity -extremely high integrity",

        "abstract": "Building a real-time net-centric capability for sharing radar data between the Global Information Grid (GIG) and the System Wide Information Management (SWIM) network presents new and unique challenges. \u00a0Trident Systems and CloudShield Technologies propose to leverage the Quality of Service (QoS) plan and system architecture developed in Phase I to implement a full-scale prototype implementation of GIG-SWIM Gateway (GSG). The proposed solution utilizes the CS-2000 content processing platform from CloudShield. The system will support two sources of data: real-time, such as Airborne Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS_B) position data and non-real-time (XML stream). For the non-real time data, the GSG server will perform the clean/dirty word checking that will be implemented by regular expression searches. To implement the strict latency requirements for the real-time radar data, CGC will use Layer 2-7 filters to classify and tag traffics that are not possible to intercept by using filters on TCP and UDP ports. \u00a0The CS-2000s Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) capabilities will be utilized to enforce guard policies between networks. \u00a0GSG will use a combination of packet header and payload inspection in order to prevent unauthorized release of data as well as preventing malicious code from being delivered to classified networks.  BENEFIT: The GSG will enable new flexibility in cross-domain exchange of near real-time data with strict latency requirements. In so doing, the CGG will provide a new net-centric capability for sharing radar data between the Global Information Grid (GIG) and the System Wide Information Management (SWIM). The proposed GSG solution may be used in private sector for secure, real-time cross-domain data transfer. \u00a0For example, in environments with real-time audio and/or video feeds those have strict latency requirements, but also have bi-directional requirements for non-real-time data transfer. \u00a0CGC can also be used by T1 providers as next generation switches to allow networks, nodes, and capabilities to be rolled out at a fraction of the cost, with substantially greater efficiency, control, and scalability. Additionally, the large service providers may use GSG capabilities to implement the robust perimeter defense, active and passive intrusion prevention, and high speed cross-domain solutions.",

In this proposal UDC and L3 Displays will develop low power consumption flexible full color video rate phosphorescent OLED displays (LPFD) that can be rolled around a cylinder for stowage. The team will deliver four breadboard subsystems at Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 5, utilizing a 6 diagonal 480 x 480 pixel full color low power consumption phosphorescent OLED display wrapped around a 2.5 diameter cylinder containing power supplies, and wireless communication electronics. The resultant display device will show full motion video and have wired and wireless connectivity enabled by the electronics contained within the cylindrical housing, with an average luminance of 200 cd/m2. To our knowledge, this display represents the worlds largest and highest resolution OLED display fabricated on a metal substrate, and also the first designed to wrap around a cylinder for stowage.  BENEFIT: The successful outcome of this Program will create benefits in a variety of military and commercial applications. \u00a0It will provide the U.S Air Force with a demonstrated technology path for flexible displays to replace printed paper maps for pilots knees in tactical cockpits, and enable a large displays to be rolled up for stowage. The work performed under this contract will form the basis of a new generation of flexible AMOLED displays which can be rolled up for storage, while providing a large size high information full color video rate display when deployed. \u00a0Beyond current U.S. Air Force application, flexible displays are increasingly being considered for in a range of industrial, medical and consumer applications. For example, these include avionic and automotive applications for conformed instrument panel displays, and consumer cell phones with roll-out high information content OLED displays. \u00a0Display Bank, a leading Korean display analyst, predicts that the flexible display market value will surge from $280M in 2010 to $5.9B in 2015 and $12.2B in 2017. By developing the key technology components necessary to fabricate these displays, the UDC team, in part through the work under this Program, expects to commercialize these technologies for military and commercial applications through joint venture and/or licensing partnerships with established flat panel display manufacturers.

To support this activity, the Marines\u2019 Combat Hunter program trains behavioral \u201cprofiling\u201d, a set of skills used by military and civilian experts to read people and their interactions in complex environments. However, the Combat Hunter program has several critical limitations; it lacks throughput capacity, performance measures, and scientific grounding. Solution: Aptima proposes to develop the capability to address these limitations. IMPACTS will be a multi-media software system that provides Marines with behavioral profiling education, and exercises identifying cues in still and video imagery. IMPACTS will collect trainee performance data to diagnose skill deficiencies, provide diagnostic feedback for improving performance, and select subsequent IMPACTS training activities. These capabilities will support pre-training preparation (before live classes), trainee selection, training evaluation, and proposed scientific research to better define the core knowledge and skills of expert profilers.

        "abstract": "The objective of the current Phase II proposal is to develop methods for generating dynamically reconfigurable subaperture architectures for enhanced clutter/interference suppression and performing multiple tasks using distributed multi-sensor (MIMO) technology. \u00a0For the purpose of clutter nulling, transmitter adaptivity using smart subarray beamforming, together with adaptive interference \u00a0nulling algorithms at the receiver side are envisioned both in the slow-time as well as the fast-time domain. Using output signal to interference/jammer plus noise ratio (SINR) as an optimization strategy, for a given transmit waveform, the adaptive receiver is given by the generalized matched filter that whitens the total interference/noise scene and matches to the incoming target signal. This leads to an SINR that is still a function of the transmit waveform pattern. Additional optimization can be carried out to maximize the receiver-optimized SINR output over the transmit waveform in the fast-time. \u00a0By making use of the array output power a new strategy is proposed here to dynamically reconfigure the array so that the return signals are tailored to the desired scene, and for generating a transmit pattern together with an adaptive receiver \u00a0to effectively null out the endo-clutter effects and perform multiple tasks.  BENEFITS: Our experience in space time adaptive processing puts us in a position to develop and provide high-performance digital signal-processing algorithms that will suppress interferences, allowing a higher number of users and applications that demand higher data rates. Joint transmitter-receiver design in the slow-time and fast time allows dynamic interference suppression and anticipated interference nulling thus enhancing channel quality \u00a0while generating quality multiple beams for communication purposes. \u00a0One important area of this class of signal processing is adaptive space-time \u00a0processing also known as smart antenna processing. By incorporating adaptive signal processing algorithms and waveform diversity, smart antenna processing can be performed automatically to all users within a cellular/CDMA system. The resulting system will have a substantial increase in isolation between users at all times, allowing an effective increase in capacity and an increase in the total number of users. Translating this approach into the wireless/cellular communication would add more channels that can be packed into the existing bandwidth thus increasing throughput.",

Hence, there is a need to automatically capture the commanders current mission, augment with contextual knowledge, and assign priorities to resources supporting the commanders mission. In Phase I, we researched the requirements for learning agents that passively model individual and system behavior within the context of Air and Space Operation Centers (AOC), and shown the feasibility of building an \u00a0agent that sits in between the user and application User Interface, passively monitors user behavior in the background, applies machine learning to discover the patterns in the background, and offers to assist the user in the real-time inference mode. Here we propose to research and develop a full scale prototype of a Commanders Learning Agent for AOC environment leveraging Phase I results, and evaluate the prototype using AOC operations personnel, and knowledge engineers with experience in cognitive modeling of AOC user tasks, and investigate the feasibility of transitioning the technology to commercialization.

        "abstract": "Reconstructing 3D volumes using SAR can be immensely challenging due to limited data collection time and geometry for commonly feasible flight paths. In particular, collecting SAR phase histories densely and widely in altitude is usually infeasible, so standard SAR reconstruction methods suffer from significant sidelobing and/or low resolution. In Phase 1, SSCI demonstrated the feasibility of combining tomographic SAR backprojection methods with surface estimation using level-set implicit surface models to exploit prior knowledge - specifically that X-band radar typically exhibits little surface penetration - to constrain 3D scatterer reconstruction to a narrow surface band. SSCI also demonstrated it could simultaneously estimate the surface from 3D scattering reconstructions. The resulting joint surface and scattering estimates appear may help with applications such as 3D target ID. In Phase 2, we will extend and refine the modular software prototypes from Phase 1 for potential integration with the GOTCHA Radar Exploitation Package (GREP) in Phase 3. BAE Systems will guide development to ensure 3D reconstruction supports GOTCHA needs, including 3D site modeling for accurate DEM reconstruction, 3D clutter characterization and suppression, and 3D target signature fingerprinting for feature-aided tracking. We will accelerate the software prototypes to ensure suitability for integration into GREP applications.  BENEFIT: The 3D surface modeling and image reconstruction tools developed under this SBIR have extensive potential for application in a broad range of military and commercial domains beyond the obvious SAR applications. Possible image reconstruction and exploitation applications that could benefit include: sonar applications for underwater exploration and target tracking and identification; seismic methods for geosciences and hydrocarbon and mineral resource exploration; medical imaging using MR, CT, and ultrasound; site modeling using both radar and lidar; border security using EO or IR cameras; and \u00a0underground object characterization for applications such environmental remediation with GPR, EMI, and acoustic sensors.",

        "abstract": "Current Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) flights, including the Global Hawk weapon system, face limitations on their utilization of civil airspace because they have no capability to sense-and-avoid (SAA) other air traffic. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Regulation states that remotely/autonomously operated aircraft must have an equivalent level of safety, comparable to see-and-avoid requirements for manned aircraft, to satisfy FAA safety requirements, and must exercise due regard for the safety of other aircraft by detecting them and maneuvering to avoid them. UtopiaCompression (UC) innovative automatic cloud detection and avoidance system provides due regard for UAS using the existing EO/IR sensors. The system automatically detects cloud regions against sky and ground in live EO/IR video scenes, computes the range from UAS to clouds, estimate the size of clouds, and performs path planning for UAS to avoid clouds, all in real-time. Based on the Phase I successful feasibility study, Phase II will continue to finalize the cloud detection/tracking and ranging algorithms, optimize the codes to achieve real-time performance, and build a complete software prototype. UC will collaborate with Northrop Grumman Corporation (NGC) to integrate the cloud detection algorithms along with existing path planning technology into the NGC existing SAA suite.    BENEFIT:   Unmanned Ariel System (UAS) have become ubiquitous across the Department of Defense.  Major programs such as Global Hawk, Reaper, Sky Warrior and Broad Area Maritime Surveillance (BAMS) have formal requirements for UAS to operate routinely in civil airspace.  Accordingly, the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) established a Joint Integrated Product Team (JIPT) for UAS Airspace Integration.  This JIPT is charged with developing the technological and regulatory infrastructure needed to secure routine airspace for UAS.  Sense and Avoid (SAA) technology is a critical component of this infrastructure and the JIPT has worked diligently with the services to establish a development and certification roadmap for SAA. The intelligent cloud detection and avoidance algorithms provide a key capability component for EO/IR due regard technology for Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), including the Global Hawk weapon system.  UC maintains that the cloud detection and avoidance system solution is a quantum leap advance in state-of-the-art of autonomous navigation with \u201cdue regard\u201d for the safety of other airspace users. Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) flight crews often deviate from their filed IFR (instrument flight rules) flight plans during the course of their missions.  Regulations permit this, provided the pilots operate with \u201cdue regard\u201d for the safety of other airspace users.  Human ISR pilots provide \u201cdue regard\u2026\u201d by remaining in VMC (visual meteorological conditions) and conducting routine VFR (visual flight rules) operations; in other words, they perform the SAA function. The technology developed will be integrated and transitioned through the Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD) process to Global Hawk thereby providing full Due Regard operation using EO/IR sensors (cloud detection, ranging and avoidance) to keep the UAS in VMC so the existing SAA capability can function as designed.  UC has teamed with the prime contractor, Northrop Grumman Corporation (NGC), to transition EO/IR Due Regard technology to the Global Hawk Program by inserting the technology into the existing SAA transition plan now being ably executed by NGC. The UC team will maximize the likelihood of successful transition by working closely with Government stakeholders throughout the Phase II process. The largest catalyst for growth in the UAS sector has been, and for the next few years will continue to be, the government\u2019s trend toward information warfare and net-centric systems. UC team understands that the first application of the technology is for the Global Hawk and other military UAS. A senior analyst with the market research company, Teal Group, Steve Zaloga, identified unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as a \u201ckey element in the intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) portion\u201d of this trend, with expansions into other missions expected, as well, with the advent of hunter-killer UAVs.  Worldwide UAV expenditures are expected to more than triple over the next decade from $2.7 billion annually to $8.3 billion.  U.S. defense spending on UAVs is projected to increase more than two-fold in the next decade, from $2 billion annually to $4.5 billion. Analysts anticipate that a civil market for UAVs will emerge more slowly over the next decade, beginning with government organizations with missions and needs similar to military UAVs such as coast guards, border patrol organizations and similar national security organizations. Beyond military applications, the UC team believes that critical traction is being gained through the efforts of this SBIR program in a primary market with broad economic potential \u2013 the UAV market. The combination of UC\u2019s passive ranging (without the need to maneuver) and the cloud detection and avoidance technologies will provide far superior SAA capabilities for UAVs than that which is currently available. This is an important enabling technology because despite a large degree of interest in UAVs for a multitude of governmental and commercial purposes, adoption has been slow due to a number of technological and regulatory barriers. One of the most important remaining regulatory and technological barrier to broader adoption of UAVs, both in government and commercial venues, is the certification of a system of technology, feedback, analysis and control which can reduce the risk of air to air collision down to that of a manned flight. The technology developed by UC for this SBIR program constitutes a critical enabling technology for removing this barrier. The UC team envisions adapting the resultant technology for ground applications in the future, including Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) and OEM automotive electronics applications such as adaptive cruise control (ACC), collision warning and headway control - a lucrative market that reached a size of $810 million in 2007. UC team intend to sell the technology developed in Phases I, II and beyond in one or more of the following ways:  (1) License to OEM/reseller (2) Form joint venture/partnership to sell solutions where these core technologies will need to be integrated into the solutions (3) Subcontract to other OEMs or system integrators offering consulting services to integrate technology into a specific system or platform.  UC and DEC are collaborating to develop options (1), (2) and (3) and will partner with additional or other integrators to provide the right solution.    UC team is determined to demonstrate success with the Air Force as an initial customer and expand to other service branches and agencies.  During phase II development and beyond, the UC team will work closely with the Air Force Research Laboratory, Air Force Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) and SAA prime contractor NGC to transition the technology.",

(AFR) is developing an innovative sensor system to map the surface temperature of thermal barrier coated (TBC) turbine blades during operational testing of advanced military jet engines. Temperature mapping is a high priority capability needed to prove ceramic coatings as a reliable means to prevent blade failure in the high temperature combustion conditions of new fighter engines. Phase I research resulted in a breakthrough to advance an on-engine system and measurement methodology towards improved temperature measurements from TBC surfaces in the extreme environment. Phase II will optimize system hardware and methodology, and will accomplish on-engine development testing and demonstrations for surface temperature mapping and condition monitoring of in-service TBC blades. At the conclusion of Phase II, a functional prototype instrument will be delivered to the Air Force Arnold Engineering Development Center, providing a blade diagnostic that is of high interest to military engine test customers.  BENEFIT:   This project will result in a product that will benefit the military and military aircraft industry and also find dual use by benefiting the commercial aircraft industry and power generation industry that utilize gas turbine engines. Engine development programs will be expedited thus bringing new engines to production sooner. The product could also be used on production engines as a condition/fault monitor for improved safety and reduced maintenance.",

During this Phase II effort FIRST RF will examine a single aperture approach as well as a multi-aperture approach. Both approaches will be packaged in a blade style radome that can be mounted on a high-speed airborne platform. In the multi-aperture approach FIRST RF will also explore the extension of the frequency band into the VHF band (30-174 MHz). This will be done primarily through material loading trades. These material loading trades will be used to examine the miniaturization of the antenna thereby reducing the profile of the antenna and making it even more suitable for installation on a high-speed airborne platform.",

        "abstract": "The physiological health of soldiers is at risk due to potential biological agent exposure. Many of these agents are protein-based and can cause alterations in cellular proteins. The ability to rapidly monitor, detect, and analyze proteins will enable earlier identification of exposure and result in quicker intervention potentially saving many lives. A key step in analysis of protein mixtures is protein separation, typically accomplished using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DGE). Although well-established, the process of performing 2DGE is laborious. Furthermore, equipment used in 2DGE is not readily field-deployable. Therefore, a quick and portable method for protein separation is desirable for far-forward military use. To accomplish protein separation without the need for 2DGE, Lynntech proposes to develop a continuous-flow isoelectric point sorting system. In Phase I, Lynntech developed prototype protein separation chips and successfully demonstrated flow of protein sample mixtures through the chips. In Phase II, Lynntech will integrate separation chips with fluid handling and software control to deliver a field-deployable protein separation system to be used in forward medical hospital settings. The molecular weight and isoelectric point (pI) ranges will also be expanded to achieve rapid separation of biologically- and military-relevant proteins in the 16-200 kilodalton range with pI of 3-12.",

With the decline in Ada\u2019s popularity, it has become increasingly difficult to find skilled Ada developers to maintain this legacy code. Code maintainers who don\u2019t know Ada typically convert the code to a language they understand, which is a tedious error-prone process. A conversion engine is needed that converts Ada into more widely supported languages, provides guidance on translation, and plugs in to the maintainer\u2019s IDE. Such an engine must provide a view of each module within the context of the legacy application and weigh the relative merits of various conversion options. The converted code must also be validated against the legacy code to ensure accurate and effective conversion. Our proposed LANguage Conversion Engine (LANCE) will not only accurately translate and validate Ada code but also provide the necessary guidance to wrap or rewrite code that cannot or should not be translated. This guidance will include the necessary metadata to integrate the various code modules that have been translated, wrapped, and rewritten.

SATCAST will provide needed insight as to the nature of the data required to for operators to complete tasks and comprehension of the status of the workflow for completion of their current task list. \u00a0It is not sufficient for operators to know what piece of data they need to reach a goal state (and obtain those data hoping someone returns a phone call or email), they must have a tool that knows about their needs and can anticipate and fulfill their goal-directed objectives. Therefore, SATCASTs visualization solutions will offer visual displays not only representing the environmental effects phenomena, but also the work processes needed to build SSA.",

These applications require a relative position and attitude sensor to address challenges such as station keeping, collision avoidance, and relative orientation control. Existing sensors that have been in use for years on missions requiring vehicle docking are typically not suitable for use on microsatellites due to field of view, mass and power limitations.  In this Phase II effort, we propose to design and fabricate a proto-flight RF-RelNav sensor system that does not rely on external references such as stars or GPS signals, and then test the operation of multiple units integrated into representative small-spacecraft models. Sensor performance is expected to surpass \u00b11\u00b0 angular accuracy in all three axes, \u00b10.1 m range resolution, and 1 Hz update rates for small numbers of spacecraft. Host impacts are expected to be only 2.5 kg of mass, 750 cm3 internal volume, and 5 W of power.

This program follows the Phase I SBIR program that QUASAR Federal Systems (QFS) executed to investigate the potential suitability of various DF antenna technologies.  At the completion of the Phase I program, several recommendations were made regarding various antenna technologies that have the potential to be used as part of the QFS DF technology. For the present Phase II program, the following proposal presents the most promising approach to satisfying the stated requirements within the Phase II budget, in terms of both time and cost.  The development of prototype DF antennas under the present program will considerably extend QFS\u2019s well established DF technology to frequency bands far beyond our present capability.

During the Phase II activity, Spectra Research will demonstrate its advanced computational tools and design methodologies for optimizing performance for ultra broadband antennas to alleviate many of these issues. The Spectra Research suite of EM tools allows for the exploitation of the advantages associated with custom materials such as metamaterials, electronic bandgap (EBG) structures, and artificial dielectrics/magnetics.

In addition we will demonstrate antenna constructs incorporating advanced materials to reduce EMI, coupling, and antenna size while increasing radiation efficiency in a common aperture structure. For this Phase II program, Spectra Research will leverage its recent accomplishments in advanced antenna designs in the application of fragmented aperture and fragmented volume technologies.

        "abstract": "Current deployable solar array systems are based on designs that have been in existence for more than 30 years. \u00a0In general, these heritage designs can be divided into two classes: 1) hinged-panel arrays, which are mechanically simple but mass inefficient, and 2) tensioned-membrane arrays, which are mechanically complex but mass efficient. \u00a0Arguably, no deployable solar array designs exist that are both mechanically simple and mass efficient. \u00a0Furthermore, the largest heritage systems (i.e., tensioned-membrane arrays) are limited to less than 15 kW of total power and 50 W/kg of specific power. Higher power generation capability (i.e., greater than 50 kW) with efficient packaging (i.e., greater than 400 W/kg) is becoming an important requirement for many future Air Force missions. GaAs-based multi-junction solar cells can now be thinned (below 20 microns-thick) in order to produce flexible solar cells of the same efficiency as current, much thicker, state-of-the-art rigid solar cells. If these thinned cells are integrated onto next-generation, ultra-lightweight, deployable solar array structures that exploit the novel design characteristics of the cells, 6 fold \u00a0improvements to the specific power (>450W/kg) of space deployable solar arrays can be attained in the near term for systems up to 100kW in size. Thin, flexible-cell arrays offer a potential solution to the above challenges, as they are capable of more compactly stowing for launch, while having a lower mass than traditional arrays. Unfortunately, the benefits attained by populating array structures derived from heritage deployable technologies with these thin, flexible-cells are not sufficient. In order to achieve the desired power output and specific power goals for next-generation solar power systems, lightweight solar array structures must also be designed and optimized for the new thin cell technologies. These lightweight solar arrays must provide significant advances upon the specific power of the array, while still retaining the stiffness requirements for launch and on-orbit attitude control maneuvers.  BENEFIT: Lightweight solar array structures will provide higher specific power and available power than existing rigid crystalline multi-junction solar cell arrays. \u00a0Integration of thinned GaAs-based multi-junction solar cells into the design of the RAPDAR passively deployed lightweight solar array will show the feasibility of this class of power platform. Commercial applications for this technology include DoD, Commercial and NASA missions.",

        "abstract": "In the modern electronic warfare environment a network-centric tracking system will have to function in a variety of jamming scenarios.  The coordinated use of multiple distributed sensors by network communication has the potential to substantially improve track state estimates, associated feature and attribute estimates, and combat identification (CID) of targets, even in the presence of enemy countermeasures.  The improvement is primarily due to geometric diversity, complementary sensor information, and different coverage areas and these effects are precisely those that are particularly desirable for tracking problems involving passive angle measurements.  With respect to tracking, multiple target tracking methods divide into two broad classes, namely single frame and multiple frame methods. The performance advantage of the multiple frame methods over the single frame methods follows from the ability to hold difficult decisions in abeyance until more information is available or, equivalently, the opportunity to change past decisions to improve current decisions.  Accordingly, the focus of this research will be the interaction of ECM scenarios with advanced multi-target multi-sensor multiple frame tracking algorithms and to provide network-centric processing of passive angle measurements.",

        "abstract": "Military operations in urban warfare provide an added emphasis to effectively detect, track, and ID ground targets in challenging environments. \u00a0Given the high dynamic nature of ground targets and the ambiguity that may result from closely spaced targets, incorporation of feature data from sensors such as hyperpsectral imagery (HSI) cameras provides a means to disambiguate the tracking of these targets. \u00a0The benefit of using these sensors in multi-target tracking is the ability to build feature models for target tracks based on the spectral information over multiple wavelengths. \u00a0The video-based tracking community has demonstrated the ability to resolve closely spaced targets by incorporating color features versus intensity data alone. \u00a0The addition of 20 to 200 additional wavelengths has the potential to significantly improve a target trackers ability to distinguish among targets. \u00a0The Phase II effort will develop and demonstrate an innovative multiple target feature-aided tracking system and culminate in a hardware and software prototype for delivered to AFRL for on-going test and analysis. The system will focus on HSI feature-aided tracking of multiple targets in an urban setting using both real and simulated data collected from persistent surveillance platforms.  BENEFITS: The results of the Phase II effort will provide a compelling resource for demonstrating the applicability of our system to DoD customers. The hardware and software demonstration tools will allow both Numerica and AFRL to directly illustrate the utility of an autonomous multiple target tracking system based on persistent hyperspectral data. This will appeal to customers ranging from researchers, who will see the potential enhancements that could be developed within the system, to users, who will be able to immediately recognize the operational benefit of employing our system. Admittedly, the system will have varying levels of capability for a given application, requiring additional effort to ensure it meets specific requirements. This is, however, in direct line with the commercialization concept of bringing a capability to a level that allows customers to realize the benefits of continued investment for the purpose of transition. In this regard, the Phase II program is essential in providing a foundation for Phase III where the validated concepts, innovative approaches, and tested methods could be transitioned to an operational system for a specific real-time intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance.",

        "abstract": "The current state-of-the-art for heat exchanger analysis and design relies heavily on analytical approaches which are immature and highly empirical, thus making the ability to optimize advanced heat transfer devices improbable without comprehensive characterization efforts. To address this problem, a Heat Exchanger analytical tool is proposed for rapid thermal analysis and design optimization of advanced heat exchangers. Heat exchanger characterization and scaling laws are incorporated in the model through application of fundamental physical equations and relationships to provide accurate scaling for geometry, configuration, installation effects, materials, working fluids, structural impacts, and manufacturing considerations. Component templates are incorporated to allow construction of heat exchangers, including new concepts and advanced designs, providing the means to investigate potential candidate technologies and heat transfer mechanisms that can lead to improvements in heat exchanger volumetric efficiency over current technology while reducing the time frame from concept to finished product. A multi-disciplinary approach is used to evaluate the interactions of the thermal analysis, working fluid flow analysis, and structural analysis to provide heat exchanger designs optimized for thermal performance, cost, volume, and weight. The tool will be demonstrated in the design of an advanced heat exchanger that will be tested to validate the analytical models.  BENEFIT: HEXDesign provides the enabling technology, in the form of a computer tool, to design optimized heat exchangers for thermal management systems. It is a commercially marketable software package focused on meeting the thermal challenges facing air, ground, and space transportation in the 21st Century. HEXDesign provides customers with a user-friendly design optimization tool that may be applied in the design of heat exchangers for thermal management systems. The Phase II effort will result in the development of HEXDesign for commercial sale to support heat exchanger design and analysis for a myriad of markets, ranging from aerospace applications to manned ground vehicles. Potential customers in this field include both military and commercial customers. Military customers include Air Force, Navy, Army, NASA and DARPA.

In particular we propose to investigate the combined techniques of \u00a0digital nonlinear equalization of harmonic distortions (NLEQ) and of digital equalization of interleaved modalities (iNLEQ). These two techniques use similar underlying algorithms and are complementary to each other. In conjunction these techniques have the potential for reducing spurious signals and expanding the bandwidth of receiver systems. In the second phase of the SBIR effort we will develop this approach for a receiver system by collaborating with Hittite Microwave corporation and by using one of their receiver designs. We will design, build, and test a digital receiver which will incorporate our nonlinear signal processing approach on a field programmable gate array (FPGA). We expect this type of receiver to have many benefits for the military by significantly increasing the linear dynamic range of receiver systems such as radars and SIGINT platforms. Moreover we expect this solution to be relatively inexpensive and easy to implement with low size, weight and power consumption.  BENEFIT: Assuming a successful completion of the proposed research and development there are several potential beneficial results. Receiver systems in many applications require increasing bandwidth while maintaining or increasing their linear dynamic range. Military systems that may benefit include radar systems for which increased linearity (or reduced) spurs represent the ability to detect and estimate smaller or farther targets while minimizing false alarms. SIGINT systems will be able to detect small signals of interest in a wide spectrum in the presence of strong interfering signals on smaller platforms. Commercial uses for such applications include incorporating such approaches into systems built by large defense manufacturers.

        "abstract": "American schools do not produce enough scientists and technicians. Without this human infrastructure, America will lose its position of economic, cultural and military leadership. Today, record immigration fills the gap. America cannot depend indefinitely on a favorable global brain drain. American education must improve.  A game-based learning environment could help. Students can develop new skills. Teachers can transform lessons into game content. Darwinian competition can identify the best new content.  The ideal system teaches any subject, in any game genre. These ideals demand years of development, deployment and community before useful content emerges. The system may be obsolete before becoming complete. This document suggests an alternative strategy. The same ideals can be approached by a series of smaller successes. Focusing on a single educational goal and a single highly flexible game, we can help students in 2009. We can provide teachers with tools to craft new game content.  Darwinian competition can begin.  The successes and failures of the constrained project, along with its active community and tested technology will provide a strong foundation for a generalized game system.  This document identifies a critical weakness in the educational system and a surprisingly openended game with which we propose to address it.",

BENEFIT: The success of the proposed effort can play a major role in validating the utility of spaceborne radar for tracking surface vehicles. \u00a0This technology is also applicable to airborne radars. \u00a0We anticipate future business opportunities integrating this technology into battle-space simulation environments and airborne radar systems. \u00a0Commercial applications include ship tracking and arctic sea ice tracking.",

        "abstract": "The South Bay Science and Technology Corp (SBSTC), teamed with Raytheon, proposes a cryogenic system concept utilizing all low cost space-qualified elements to yield a Low Cost Space Cryocooler System (LCSCS) for space-based launch and boost phase detection and tracking sensor applications. \u00a0To satisfy the projected two-stage cryocooling requirement, the LCSCS uses two (2) long-life, low cost single-stage cryocoolers, one at each stage. \u00a0Each cryocooler is powered and controlled by its own dedicated electronics module. \u00a0The basis for the design is the Low Cost Space Cryocooler (LCSC), developed by SBSTC and Raytheon on a previous SBIR Program. To reduce the exported vibration of the cryocooler, a simple vibration mitigation algorithm and/or a thermal storage unit is used.The objective of the Phase II Program is to develop low-cost cryocooler for LCSCS with high efficiency and modularity for multiple programs support. \u00a0At the end of Phase II, we expect to have demonstrated the key cryocooler hardware components of a low-cost and modular LCSCS that will form a basis to support multiple DoD programs and commercial applications.  BENEFIT: Most significantly, the LCSCS provides independent temperature control of each stage. \u00a0The only coupling is through the thermal interactions between the temperature stages in the sensor; the thermodynamics of the cryocoolers themselves are totally independent. \u00a0This provides much greater operational flexibility to optimize the design, adjust to changing heat loads, manage time-variant loads, etc. \u00a0From a packaging perspective, the locations of the first and second stage cryogenic interfaces are not coupled, as they would be in a two-stage linear cooler, providing packaging flexibility./The initial commercialization opportunity we are targeting for the LCSCS is the Third Generation Infrared Surveillance (3GIRS) Program. \u00a0The high capacity of the cryocooler employed is well suited to meet the 3GIRS need to cool large focal plane arrays and large optical benches. \u00a0The vibration mitigation techniques (low cost active control and/or thermal storage units) can be employed in various combinations to provide best value to the user community. Besides 3GIRS the LCSCS is also applicable to wide field of view (WFOV) full-Earth staring infrared sensor. \u00a0Each space payload will likely require two of these cryocoolers, one operational and one redundant. We anticipate that low number of cryocooler systems will be deployed starting in 2015 costing several million dollars each. The long life, high reliability, maintenance free, and low cost characteristics of this cryocooler make it ideal also for commercial applications. \u00a0Our current assessment is that for LCSCS size cryocooler, the major application is in the medical diagnostic area with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). \u00a0The noisy Gifford-McMahon cryocoolers used to cool the MRI superconductive magnets would ideally be replaced with quieter linear pulse tube cryocoolers, if the cost target can be met. \u00a0Based on the MRI market size, our preliminary assessment showed that the estimated global market for the pulse tube, high capacity type of cryocooler is $50 70 millions in 2009. \u00a0This includes other applications of using cryocoolers for products such as superconductive equipment for communication.",

        "abstract": "This SBIR project is designed to develop a high-sensitivity optical spectroscopic method for rapid health screening and monitoring including warfighter field diagnostics and, potentially, detection of chemical warfare agents. The method called noise-immune, cavity-enhanced, optical heterodyne spectroscopy (NICE-OHMS) was invented about 10 years ago, but has been considered too complex for commercial development.  We are taking advantage of recent improvements in enabling technologies to make NICE-OHMS reliable, rugged, and portable.  We anticipate, by the end of Phase II, two-to-four orders of magnitude sensitivity improvement over competing spectroscopic methods with only a modest increase in cost.  All previous NICE-OHMS research has used gas samples at reduced pressure because the laser modulation conditions are dictated by the widths of the spectroscopic lines being probed.  These widths increase with increasing pressure.  One key part of our work is shifting operation to atmospheric pressure samples.  This has the obvious advantage of simplifying NICE-OHMS by eliminating vacuum pumps and control valves; on the other hand it requires modulation frequencies exceeding 1 GHz.  Suitable inexpensive components have only recently become commercially available.  These were tested successfully in Phase I and are key parts of the Phase II prototype spectrometer.",

        "abstract": "The USAF recognizes that benefits to cold working fastener holes include significantly increased life of a structure subjected to fatigue loading. However, full realization of this potential from a maintenance and engineering standpoint is hindered by the fact that there is currently no adequate field technique for determining how well the material structure immediately surrounding the hole has responded to the cold working process. Thus, there is a distinct need be able to: 1. Determine the success of a cold working treatment at a fastener hole, 2. Quantify the results of the treatment in a robust crack growth and residual life analysis, 3. Monitor the evolution or relaxation of the residual stress state as usage on the component accumulates, and 4. Understand the effectiveness of the residual stress field in the presence of a crack. Our team\u2019s approach strives to provide depot-supportable measurement of cold work residual stresses using NDI techniques currently in the USAF maintenance infrastructure. We also aim to provide the ASIP community with the life assessment tools (based on AFGROW) and criteria needed to capture the benefits of cold working in life extension and to guard against stress relaxation, the influence of cracks, and inadequate processing.  BENEFIT:   AP/ES continues to focus on the research and development of analytical processes that simulate fatigue from nucleation, through short crack growth, to structural failure of components. This advanced service life assessment capability places APES into the unique position to pursue comprehensive solutions to problems across many air vehicles platforms and multiple industries that need to assess and maintain the integrity of their structure. APES efforts have improved fatigue analytical models that account for surface integrity effects in the nucleation phase from constituent particles, fretting, effects of many types of corrosion, and the interaction of widespread or multiple site damage (WFD or MSD). APES successes have been leading the industry in life prediction approaches that are presently being pursued by others in the AFRL and other DoD organizations. APES models are readily integrated into or linked with the existing life prediction methodologies and codes, such as FASTRAN and AFGROW. The addition of residual stress influences and the time-dependent nature of residual stress relaxation to crack growth modeling will be a powerful augmentation to the toolbox available to us as consulting engineers and to our customers. The keen interest in these holistic structural integrity processes has already provided our business with close links with various military and civilian aviation organizations in the US and Canada. A key element of the proposed program is the concurrent development and validation of non-destructive inspection techniques that can be directly integrated into existing USAF maintenance programs using equipment already in the USAF inventory. The advantage that would be afforded to APES and other project participants, which includes the multiple aircraft customers and agencies, is that the integration process is established along with the technical solution. The proposed approach thus enables rapid and cost effective incorporation into the particular customer\u2019s infrastructure and provides opportunities for APES to grow as a consulting engineering business, which is our forte. The work proposed here directly supports the needs of at least two USAF ASIP offices and, if successful, could provide a direct path to commercialization in Phase III.",

        "abstract": "Attitude determination of spin-stabilized platforms is especially challenging. Current low-cost gyroscope technology does not lend itself to attitude determination of platforms spinning in excess of one rotation per second. Traditional GPS-based attitude (GPS/A) sensors require three or more antenna elements separated by large baselines. Single-element designs require extensive calibration of the satellite signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and are not very accurate. Toyon Research Corporation proposes to develop a small, single-aperture low-cost GPS/A sensor for space launch vehicles, and to demonstrate the sensor in an operational environment. The sensor determines the platform attitude with a single GPS antenna having a diameter of approximately 6.5 cm. The standalone performance of Toyon's GPS/A sensor on a spinning platform is better than 2.1 degrees for roll, and better than 1.2 degrees for yaw and pitch (one-sigma). The system performance can be further improved when integrated with accelerometers and/or magnetometers. Although current low-cost gyroscope technology does not allow their use on spinning platforms, non-spinning platforms may take advantage of gyro measurements for further improvements in attitude performance. During the proposed Phase II program Toyon will develop, build and test a prototype system that will be delivered for validation onboard an actual space launch vehicle.",

        "abstract": "The Joint Strike Fighter is considering the use of organic and ceramic matrix composites for high temperature engine components. Material coupons and flight tests have shown that when these materials are exposed to high temperatures in the presence of air, salt fog, and humidity they can react chemically. The chemical reactions may cause a significant loss in composite strength even though there is no physical evidence of dam-age. Standard non destructive evaluation techniques such as ultrasonics, radiography, and thermography have not been able to accurately identify and monitor the chemical changes. Fortunately emerging NDE techniques based on electrical resistivity, electro-magnetics, and dielectric properties have shown promise in relating chemical changes to NDE signal. These techniques, however, are in their infancy and the measurements are sensitive to sensor design, scanning technique, and data interpretation. In order to devel-op the electromagnetic-based NDE methods into useful engineering tools, it is necessary to understand the theoretical dielectric properties of advanced composites. The develop-ment of a micromechanical model for composite dielectric properties will support the de-velopment of NDE techniques and standards that can monitor chemically induced changes in advanced composite engine components. Materials Research & Design proposes to build upon their demonstrated under-standing of composite material theory and develop a micromechanical model that relates composite dielectric behavior to constituent properties, fiber volume fraction, and fiber orientation. In the Phase I effort, a micromechanical model was developed and exercised to compute composite dielectric properties. The composite consists of fibers, up to two discrete fiber/matrix interface layers, and matrix materials. The dielectric properties and volume fractions of the fibers, interface layers, and matrix can be varied independently. The model can be used to compute properties of unidirectional layers and arbitrary two dimensional laminates. The results of the model include orthotropic, frequency depen-dent dielectric properties including permittivities and conductivities (or dielectric con-stants and loss tangents). The theory was tested for feasibility by comparison to NDE signals measured on CMCs of interest. The model showed excellent agreement with measured dielectric properties. This Phase II program will be performed in conjunction with a compatible Phase II effort that is being proposed by Jentek. The Jentek Phase II will focus on the develop-ment of dielectric sensors and data acquisition. The MR&D Phase II will expand the mi-cromechanical theory and integrate the resulting software with Jentek\u2019s sensors and data acquisition systems. The overall goal of both Phase II programs is to create an integrated NDE tool that can provide \u201cgo-no go\u201d decisions for CMCs related to incoming material inspection, fabricated component quality, an in service degradation",

        "abstract": "The Army, the DoD and Industry, have minimal capability for functional testing of its prime weapon systems at all phases of maintenance. Furthermore, the Services are not facilitated with the ability to perform Coherent Parallel Test and provide Diagnostic Imaging utilizing high input/output (I/O) density test instruments and systems. Current test systems have been designed to perform sequential test which drive throughput limitations and affect the time spent testing and repairing Units Under Test (UUTs).  These limitations are driving the cost of maintaining Army primary weapon systems and diminishing their availability. Additionally, these limitations are proving to be critical impediments in maintaining UUT performance and ultimately readiness. New technologies in the Software, Test, Radar and Medical Industries can facilitate the development of Coherent Parallel Test and Diagnostic Imaging (CPTDI) software tools that will enable the test systems of today and tomorrow to advance the Armys (and DoD) repair capability in Intermediate and Depot repair facilities, as well as and Industrys production and rework facilities. CPTDI will mitigate the shortfalls of todays systems sequential approach to testing and allow for functional testing and diagnostics of low to high density I/O Shop Repairable Units and Line Replaceable Units.",

The LRDH offers a low cost mission alternative to expensive resources such as helicopters and fixed wing aircraft and allows commanders to run more missions more effectively while increasing situational awareness and enhancing team safety. The system is inexpensive and easily deployed because it utilizes low cost, man-portable LRDH equipped Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAV\u2019s) to form an instant broadband mesh network in the sky. The teams are easy to equip because they use Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), laptops or other standard Wi-Fi devices to access the GIG connectivity. The LRDH Comms Module is an enhanced COTS based technology that includes 2 radios and a high performance directional antenna system. One radio is used to create an Internet Protocol (IP) based communication mesh network in the sky.

The key enabling technology is a composite material that is flexible at room temperature but rigidizes when exposed to high temperatures.  The result is a wing structure that is able to withstand both the temperatures and aerodynamic loads encountered during the expected flight profile. This revolutionary wing material is the focus of the proposed effort.  Andrews Space proposes to increase the technology readiness level (TRL) of the material by testing in simulated heating environments that are representative of those encountered during hypersonic flight operations.

        "abstract": "Aircraft wing structures experience comparable levels of pushdown and pullup forces, which subject them to near-reversible (tension-compression) stress systems. Fiber reinforced polymer composites provide distinctly high tensile strength and modulus, which cannot be matched by their compressive performance. Reversible stress cycles are also detrimental to the fatigue life of composites. Hence, compressive stresses govern the design of aircraft wing composite structures, leaving their superior tensile attributes largely under-utilized. This undermines the structural efficiency of aircraft wings, and carries important weight penalties which grow with aircraft size. Our approach subjects the wing structure to a pre-tension which controls the compressive stresses in service. This approach balances the peak stress-to-strength ratios of wing structures in tension and compression, thereby improving their structural efficiency. The theoretical analyses of Phase I research verified the potential for major weight savings and significant gains in fatigue life through prestressing of composite wing structures. The experimental work conducted in Phase I research confirmed that prestressing renders statistically significant benefits to the compressive and flexural performance of composite panels, and also to the flexural performance of composite box sections. The experimental trends agreed with theoretical predictions. The advantages of prestressing were preserved after impact damage. The proposed Phase II project will: (i) develop refined analysis and design techniques for prestressed wing structures; (ii) optimize the design of prestressed wing structures; (iii) experimentally verify the prestressing effects on representative structural components, and evaluate the benefits of prestressing to aircraft wing structures; and (iv) evaluate broader applications of prestressing to aircraft structures.  BENEFIT:   The weight savings and the gains in fatigue life resulting from prestressing of composite wing structures promise important benefits in terms of fuel efficiency, pollution control, service life, maintainability, and initial and life-cycle economy. These benefits can be realized with relatively small changes in design and fabrication of aircraft structures. Major airframers constitute the primary customers for use of prestressing in aircraft structures. Aircraft production is a $220 billion market, about $35 billion of which may be attributed to aircraft structures. Prestressing is a simple and low-cost technique which promises close to $3.5 billion annual saving in aircraft production. The eventual benefits of the technology in terms of fuel saving and pollution control are even more significant. Prestressing is a complement to (and not a competition for) alternative efforts towards development of advanced materials and novel structures for reducing the aircraft production cost and weight. We are preparing a patent application which promises to provide us with a comprehensive proprietary position with respect to the technology. The estimated production cost savings have been used to develop financial projections for market transition of the technology. The Emerging Technologies Fund of Michigan has committed $125,000 towards transition of the technology to marketplace (pending success of Phase II proposal). Other arrangements have also been made for financing and management of the commercialization process. Boeing is a partner in development of the technology, and plans to take part in follow-up efforts to transfer the prestressing technique to aircraft structures.",

Potential retrofit opportunities are also envisioned.  Phase 1 analysis on NASA's Source Diagnostic Test (SDT) fan stage suggests that an EAB could realize three to four decibels overall noise reduction under the approach flight path by generating a swirling exhaust with drag equivalent to one to two turbofan-sized bluff bodies per powerplant. Such drag generation could enable slower and/or steeper and/or aero-acoustically cleaner approach trajectories.

Industry experts estimate the UAV market will more than double in size, from US$3.4B to US$7.3B, over the next decade with the most significant catalyst being UAV interest by the US military. American MAV designers would be greatly aided by the software suite proposed for Phase II.  Such integrated software is essential to designing a vehicle capable of the hover and \u201cperch and stare\u201d operations that will greatly improve the operational utility of this class of vehicle.  It will also facilitate direct comparison of mission performance across disparate vehicle configurations.  It will enable rigorous multi-disciplinary engineering analysis and design optimization before construction.  In this way, deeper understanding of technology and physics can be exploited in future systems to maximize capability.",

Creare and our collaborators from Stanford Universitys Gravity Probe-B instrumentation team, propose to design, fabricate, test, and deliver a micromachined nano-g accelerometer. \u00a0Our micromachined accelerometer is based on previously demonstrated technologies: innovative micromachined structures; capacitive position sensing; electrostatic actuation; and advanced signal processing of spectrally shifted acceleration measurements. \u00a0These sensing techniques have been demonstrated on Gravity Probe-B to be capable of measuring 10 pico-g. \u00a0By combining these previously demonstrated technologies in an innovative way, we expect to develop a nano-g accelerometer that will meet the power, mass, and size requirements of the Air Force. During Phase II, we will fabricate, test, and demonstrate a prototype micromachined nano-g accelerometer based on our innovative design. \u00a0We will deliver a prototype accelerometer that can be easily integrated with Space Plug-and-Play Avionics hardware as required by the Air Force.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Busek''s BHT-200 (200W) Hall thruster was flight qualified for the TacSat-2 program and successfully operated in space during 2007.  During duration testing conducted at AFRL the BHT-200 was operated for approximately 1800 hours (equivalent to approximately 50% increase ion It/Mw) less than the Phase III IHPRPT Goal of 70% increase in It/Mw.  Concurrent with the IHPRPT demonstration test, Busek identified several design modifications in a related Phase II SBIR that lessen the erosion of the dielectric insulators that we propose to investigate. Several emerging Space Test Program (STP), and orbit transfer missions require lifetime in excess of 3000 hours.  Therefore, the focus of the Phase II effort is to extend the lifetime of the BHT-200 to >3000 hours making it attractive to a broader range of end users.  In the proposed Phase II, Busek will continue with design and operating modifications to the thruster that minimize the impingement of ions onto the insulator surfaces.  In parallel, Busek will use optical emission spectroscopy and develop a real time diagnostic for assessing insulator erosion rates.    BENEFIT:  Based on numerous inquiries received from end users, a long life low power Hall thruster will be attractive for many commercial and government satellites and small satellites for Operationally Responsive Space.  A prime example is several Space Test Program (STP) missions where the Hall thruster has been identified as mission enabling.  In addition the BHT-200 has been baseline for a standardized propulsion module for ESPA secondary payloads.  In this application the BHT-200 could provide 1.5km/second deltas-V to 125 kg payloads.  In addition to the propulsion market, the BHT-200 can be adapted for ion cleaning applications.",

However, it is not currently possible to display immersive environments in a manner that represents a real world scene viewed with 20/20 eyesight in a cost effective manner. The effect is that pilots train as if they have less than 20/20 eyesight. Simulations can be tailored to compensate for this reduced resolution, but this produces inaccuracies in the simulated world. In this effort, we propose to build a display system that provides very high resolution imagery at the point where the fovea is focused and lower resolution imagery throughout the rest of the scene. As we have done in the past, we will leverage COTS projection displays to develop the overall displays and our existing eye tracking technology to monitor how to move the high-resolution screen to keep it aligned with the fovea.

As sensor outputs far outstrip available bandwidth, compression of the vast quantities of data collected by Wide Area Persistent Surveillance (WAPS) imaging systems becomes a necessity.  In Phase 1, we used accurate registration to achieve good compression ratios, but were ultimately limited by parallax movement in the imagery.  The compression technology we propose for Phase 2 is based on factoring out the parallax induced motion which is a result of not having a sufficiently accurate 3D model.  We will remove parallax effects by creating high resolution 3D models which contain accurate locations for depth discontinuities.  Compression can then be free to encode changes which can\u2019t be compressed with a static model, such as the independent movement of objects and appearance of new objects.  By spending processing power before the narrow transmission pipe on creating accurate models, we can achieve compression ratios which will open up new applications for imagery access.",

        "abstract": "The Joint IED Defeat Organization (JIEDDO) has identified three lines of operations to combat the IED threat: defeat the device, defeat the network, and train the force. While defeating the device is necessary, attacking the network is the only line of operation that supports intervention to the left of the bang and counterinsurgency operations as insurgents adjust their tactics and weaponry. Attacking the network addresses the underlying insurgency support structure that enables them to exist and operate among indigenous populations. These networks are dependent on the local populace support or passivity. Consequently, both insurgencies and stabilizing elements, such as provincial reconstruction teams, are in a constant struggle to gain support of the local populace because in the end the local people decide who wins. This struggle impacts daily operations of US forces. To enable commanders to understand the root causes and complex interactions among the local populace, insurgency and coalition forces that motivate and enable terrorist activities and their supporting networks, Securboration is teaming with socio-cultural modeling expert Dr. Eugene Santos from Dartmouth College to develop the Effects-Based Approach to Neutralizing IEDs, or EBANI.  BENEFIT: EBANI has the potential to provide great benefit to stability and reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan. EBANI can aid Afghanistan Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) by helping to strengthen provincial and district-level institutions and empower local leaders who support the Central Government in Afghanistan. EBANI can help PRTs create conditions that make increased political, social, and economic development possible. \u00a0This will contribute to diminishing the insurgency threat, as they cannot survive without local support. \u00a0The result will be a large savings in hardware procurement to combat IEDs, and emphasis on addressing root causes that allow insurgencies to exist, which is scalable across tactics and weaponry. Additionally, EBANI has several private sector opportunities that focus on understanding local populace perceptions. These includes business competitive intelligence (treating the competing business as the insurgency trying to gain local / customer support), politics (to understand and align the local populace inclinations), world banking initiatives (to evaluate effects of monetary stimulus strategies on the local populace), and the interactive gaming environments (incorporated in a gaming engine to enhance realism of existing platforms).",

Current existing multi-spectral sensing systems employ dispersive optics (gratings or prisms), or external polarizer technologies to obtain spectral and polarimetric information. These systems are heavy, bulky, and unable to detect all polarization components simultaneously. In the SBIR Phase I research, we have developed a new monolithically integrated multi-spectral polarimetric quantum dot photodetector (QDIP) with on-demand waveband selection and simultaneous polarization sensing capabilities. Advantages of the proposed QDIP design including low dark current and high photodetectivity and voltage tunable multispectral infrared detections were demonstrated with very uniform and reproducible performance. Broadband (2-14um) nanowire-grid polarizer was demonstrated with >30dB extinction ratio. Monolithically integrated polarizer with the multi-spectral QDIP was achieved. \u00a0Motivated by the feasibility demonstration and great advantages of the proposed multi-spectral polarimetric QDIP, in Phase II, we will develop a large format (640x512) multi-spectral polarimetric QD focal plane array (FPA). Successfully developing the proposed innovation is expected to provide an enabling multi-spectral polarization agile FPA technology for space and airborne and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) applications.

BENEFITS: The Air Force is faced with destroying targets that are ever more deeply buried and fortified. \u00a0New generations of penetrating munitions need to be developed to meet this mission requirement. \u00a0Higher speed airframes and advanced penetration technology warheads are key technologies that deliver and focus the energy required to penetrate and destroy these new, highly fortified targets. \u00a0However, if the attitude of the penetrating munitions airframe is not closely aligned with its velocity vector at impact, then the energy will be dissipated prior to reaching the required depth. \u00a0Inertial instruments cannot measure the misalignment with sufficient accuracy. \u00a0This proposal offers to develop and demonstrate an innovative imaging system that precisely measures the angle between the munitions velocity vector and its centerline with an innovative, imagery based sensor. \u00a0Once measured, the autopilot can rapidly zero this angle during the impact phase of the flight. This technology also creates the basis for an innovative guidance system. \u00a0In addition to a Phase III transition for Boosted Penetrators, a transition to Phase III commercialization is encouraged by multiple Air Force, Army, Navy, and Special Operations applications requiring precise, covert, image-based terminal homing that has the robustness of a gyro-stabilized seeker system in a small, light weight, low cost strapdown configuration.",

The compound eye has evolved into many forms, each one of which is specifically adapted to the optical environment of the insect or crustacean that it resides upon. The applications of artificial compound eye sensors range from highly complex applications such as terminal seeker optics and missile approach warning systems, to guidance sensors for micro-robots. This effort proposes the use of compound eye sensors as a replacement to dual mode sensors for use in target detection, tracking, and guidance integrated fuzing.  BENEFITS: The multi-aperture optical system design has several advantages over the typical single aperture systems found in military weapons and commercial applications. The ability to maintain a large sensor FOV, with minimal distortion, and optimal depth of field, provides a great benefit for both commercial and military applications. This sensor, employed on a missile seeker, provides a WFOV, low frame rate capability required for target search, and a high frame rate lower resolution mode required for warhead fuzing, all in a single sensor. \u00a0The WFOV sensor allows for elimination of complexity and cost of seeker gimbals typically required to achieve adequate field-of-regard. For commercial applications, the low distortion WFOV sensor is ideal for surveillance covering a large area. Processing techniques are used to identify specific areas of interest, and provide a high resolution image chip for intruder identification.

This Phase II MDA SBIR Program will seek to demonstrate that our new low cost, very high temperature, non-charring, Zirconium Oxy-Carbide (ZrOC) structural insulator material can solve the material problems currently experienced on the OEM\u2019s DACS divert valves.  Using this material, we will scale up the process from lab scale to pilot scale and produce component parts.  With Aerojet\u2019s support, these components will be analyzed and tested for mechanical and thermal properties to meet component qualification requirements and will be subjected to ground testing.  At the end of this Phase II we expect to be at a TRL 6 and ready to field a DACS full nozzle assembly qualifications test.",

        "abstract": "Each of the more than 40,000 fastener heads in the F-35''s outer mold line must be covered with a special polyester-based thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) fastener fill material prior to application of outer mold line primer and final finish coatings that ultimately define the stealth of the aircraft. This is currently a time-consuming, labor-intensive operation that results in a high potential for variations in installation quality from fastener to fastener. Systems and Materials Research Corporation (SMRC) proposes development of the Rapid Intelligent Fastener Fill System (RIFFS), an automated handheld tool that the operator simply places over an installed fastener head. With the press of a button, RIFFS dispenses a TPU dot over the fastener head, melts and compresses the dot to adhere to the primed fastener and fastener cavity while filling all crevices, and removes and disposes of excess TPU material above flush to the airframe - all in under 30 seconds. RIFFS accomplishes this by delivering near-infrared energy to the TPU dot, rapidly and uniformly melting the dot as a plunger compresses the material into the fastener cavity. In this Phase II program, fastener fill installation, melting, compression, and final finish techniques will be developed for use in RIFFS.  BENEFIT: The Rapid Intelligent Fastener Fill System (RIFFS) will shorten fastener installation times to less than 30 seconds per fastener with minimal residual cleanup, while improving process safety, and reducing operator fatigue. With over 40,000 fasteners in the F-35 outer mold line and current fastener fill installation times of approximately 2 minutes per fastener, a potential savings of 1,000 hours per aircraft in direct labor may be realized, saving 312,000 man-hours per year at F-35 full rate production. RIFFS will be used by field maintainers as well as on the manufacturing floor to ensure that the low radar profiles engineered into the F-35 and other stealth platforms are sustainable throughout their life cycles.",

        "abstract": "The DoD has a strong motivation to foster low cost nanolithography techniques ~ its IC requirements are in small volumes, thus tooling and masking costs cannot be amortized over large volumes and represents a very large number.  The costs associated with the nanolithography step can be ascribed to the diffraction limit of light.  Recently, it was shown that the diffraction limit of light could be circumvented by the use of materials with \u201cnegative refractive index\u201d.  Lenses that operate beyond the diffraction limit were demonstrated at 365 nm working wavelength.   Tanner is proposing the use of such negative index materials as the critical enabling technology in a low cost nanolithography system.  In Phase I, we demonstrated that negative index materials could be realistically fabricated at 193 nm (the working wavelength for current nanolithography systems).  In Phase II, we will extend the work to a physical demonstration of a farfield superlens (FSL), a nearfield superlens, and a projection hyperlens.  We will also work with the semiconductor industry to develop a design for a lithography system, along with a complete set of metrics that would be of interest to the industry.",

        "abstract": "Military operations require sustained cognitive performance in challenging environments. Situational awareness, vigilance, memory, decision-making, and other neurocognitive processes are all impacted by poor sleep quality, sleep deprivation and accumulating sleep debt with potentially detrimental consequences. Although efficient amelioration of the effects of sleep deprivation or accumulated sleep debt can be achieved by various means in the short term (e.g. use of caffeine or other pharmacological stimulants, physical exercise), there is no replacement for real sleep in the long run. In operational environments, or in other situations that do not allow for regular sleep schedules with 7-8 hours of overnight sleep, brief naps taken at various times throughout the day effectively counter fatigue and improve performance. This Phase 2 project completes the design, implentation and testing of the NapCap platform to address the challenges faced with napping in an operational environment. State-of-the-art sleep research findings are used to guide the development of an integrated system with multiple modules designed to bi-directionally gate sensory modalities.  External manipulation of the senses accomplishes three napping goals: decrease sleep latency, increase sleep efficiency, and determine the best wake point during a nap episode.  The NapCap is constructed and designed around the ABM wireless EEG Sensor Headset.",

The majority of this work, however, has focused upon the problem of tracking a handful of high value targets for lengthy periods.  There is a need to develop systems that detect anomalous activities that have the potential to be threatening or to be militarily significant.  Such detections may result in high value target tracks, but the objective of this effort is to manage a constrained set of ISR assets to detect anomalous events.  This requires the an automated resource manager to actively command sensors and modes, and to do so in a manner that de-conflicts parallel, competitive tasks.  The sensor suite must simultaneously build normalcy models, detect anomalies, command sensor timeline to evaluate anomalies, and manage concurrent, high value tracks.  Black River Systems proposes to develop a system architecture that manages sensor resources to execute four concurrent objectives:  normalcy monitoring, anomaly detection, anomaly interrogation, and high value target track.  Leveraging our tracking, sensor resource management, and simulation and modeling experience, we will demonstrate and analyze system performance through trade studies and simulations.",

Such non-traditional sensors collect a diverse range of data that can offer a more accurate and comprehensive Common Operational Picture of the battlespace when fused with conventional ISR collection capabilities. At present, much of the utility and timeliness of this data is lost due to separation and stove piping of these systems so fusion with conventional and non-conventional Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) systems can only be performed with human intervention. The Department of Defenses Global Information Grid (GIG) will need to provide shared situation awareness for Full-spectrum Dominance of the battlespace by the warfighter by establishing machine-to-machine interfaces to facilitate the automated discovery, understanding, use, and sharing of the information and services accessible via the GIG.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The proposed project will remove the computational bottleneck in the currently adopted numerical treatment of exterior 3D magnetic fields around high-current pulsed power devices. Existing simulators introduce computationally expensive and nonphysical magnetic diffusion in the exterior region. In contrast, our approach is physically and mathematically rigorous and dramatically improves both accuracy and speed of the computation. In Phase I, our innovative methods for both quasi-static and wave components of 3D magnetic fields were developed, tested and validated on numerical and analytical model problems, both linear and nonlinear. Specific and verifiable advantages of our methodology include: (i) high accuracy due to rigorous analytical treatment of the exterior fields; (ii) no need for dense system matrices; (iii) no singular integration kernels; (iv) single scalar (as opposed to vector) potentials; (v) negligible computational overhead for the plasma simulator; (vi) ease of coupling with legacy interior codes such as Mach3; (vii) parallelizability; (viii) applicability to time-varying geometries. In Phase II, our algorithms will be implemented as robust software tools, combined with the interior MHD codes Mach3 and WARPX, and validated on the appropriate Air Force problems. Coupled field-circuit co-simulation capabilities for complex devices will be included.  BENEFIT:  Air Force missions require improvements and innovations in the modeling of 3D magnetic fields.  The proposed project will provide innovative methods and software for highly efficient and precise computation of magnetic fields and waves around high-current pulsed power application systems. Potential dual and commercial applications are vast and diverse: fields around plasma fusion devices, magnetic recording, electromagnetic devices for oil exploration, quasi-static and electrodynamics problems of plasmonics (one of the most vibrant areas of nano-photonics), electromagnetic interference and capacitance of interconnects in microelectronics. The new modeling and simulation tools for 3D electromagnetic fields will help Air Force to: (i) assess technologies, devices, and materials for new high-current pulsed power application systems; (ii) better evaluate the performance at the early design stages;  (iii) set requirements for testing;  reduce the cost and time of testing. The modeling and design tools will provide reduction in cost and time-to-market through reduced experimental R&D, design cycle, and streamlined laboratory testing.",

High-quality imagery is crucial to this effort for several purposes, including navigation, false-alarm/decoy identification, and estimation of position and speed of potential targets.  Although high-resolution imaging systems are readily available, they require (1) power-hungry CMOS arrays (or FPAs) and (2) large-aperture optics, which are heavy, expensive and are not compatible with the aerodynamic profile of high-speed interceptors.  Fortunately, signal processing methods have been developed that produce high-resolution images using low-resolution equipment.  This family of algorithms is known as super-resolution.  Although super-resolution algorithms have been studied extensively by the research community, their implementation and deployment have been limited due to high computational cost and the inability to work in real-time for realistic applications.  In the Phase I portion of this project, we demonstrated a prototype device showing accelerated  processing with advanced super-resolution techniques.  In Phase II, we propose extending the functionality of this prototype and modifying its form factor to integrate with current and future missile interceptors.

In an effort to reduce operating costs and increase system safety, there has been significant research and development focused on wireless sensor systems. To date, there has been limited penetration of wireless technologies to control systems. Those that have been deployed often lack security features and rely on proprietary messaging protocols. The resulting lack of trust for wireless networking and its associated installation\ncomplexity greatly limits growth opportunities. Toyon's focus in this Phase II effort is on the development of an open-standards secure\nwireless sensor system. The overall system architecture is based on the IEEE 1451 standard for smart sensor systems. By employing IEEE 1451 there is standardization over not only the messaging protocol that rides on top of the wireless protocol, but the sensors themselves. The result is that individual system elements, provided by different vendors, will all work together in a seamless fashion.\nOur focus for wireless communications is ZigBee-Pro which brings to bear numerous advanced security features, including NSA certified 128-bit AES encryption. This is paired with a backend Ethernet connection that leverages a secure interface based on\nHTTPS.",

        "abstract": "SDC proposes a Phase II project to leverage the numerous technology development programs toward an integrated kill vehicle assembly.  The individual component technologies are well into development, however, the impact of simply adding the subcomponents into a traditional missile structure is a KV assembly with redundant structure.  The objectives of the Phase II program is to integrate MDA-developed critical technologies that will result in a reduced volume and reduced mass kinetic kill vehicle.  The technical innovation is the tailoring of lightweight composite materials into configurations that provide subsystem integration and eliminate the redundant structure.  For this proposal, technologies will be integrated into a prototype KV to address all the functions of the KV including propulsion, electronics and communication antenna packaging directly onto the structural walls, layered radiation hardening of electronics and a sensor assembly that includes seeker electronics and optics packaged on a common mounting surface.  Because the proposed Phase II focus is integrating several technologies, SDC has partnered with other companies to create a critical mass of technologies for integration into a KV assembly.  The goal for the end of the Phase II program is to fabricate and test some functionality of full scale KV subsystems and to demonstrate integration of the subsystem into a prototypical assembly",

        "abstract": "Real time topology management for the dynamic Airborne Network can result in lower interference, higher network capacity and fault-tolerance capability UtopiaCompression Corporation (UC) proposes a deliberative/reactive topology management solution that uses the knowledge of airborne network deployment mission and airborne node mobility. In addition to the advantages cited earlier, UC presents an architecture that promises low real-time computation overhead, graceful performance degradation, adaptive to traffic loading and resistance to jamming. The proposed Mission Aware Topology Control (MAToC) interacts with routing, link, MAC and physical layers for overall efficiency. MAToC uses computationally efficient convex optimization libraries for real-time operation. MAToC features a unique iterative power and channel optimization methodology that maximizes the worst case Signal to Interference Ratio (SINR) in the airborne network thus maximizing overall network capacity. Reactive MAToC is capable of repairing broken links in real-time. UC team has also designed an ad hoc flight plan exchange protocol that use omni-directional antennas.  BENEFIT: UCs topology management technology will greatly benefit the Air Force by providing dynamic networking among MANET and terrestrial domains. Network topology management technology, such as that proposed by UC, will enable improved situational awareness to incident commanders and other relevant actors by allowing free flowing of information and intelligence such as navigational data, targets, and strike results among both manned and unmanned aircraft within both MANET and terrestrial domains. Consequently, the proposed technology will greatly increase the effectiveness of incident control and strike efforts, including improved time-to-response margins and accuracy by increasing the distribution and delivery of pertinent mission information and enable a seamless tactical network environment. \u00a0There is substantial need for UCs proposed technology in the commercial markets. Not only does the Air Force have a current need for the technology, shared by other military and intelligence divisions within the government, the technology proposed by UC also enables critical communication capabilities needed by agencies such as the FAA, NASA and others to meet their missions. UCs topology management technology would be a key enabler to efficient and effective airborne internet system deployment. The power and channel assignment algorithms can be used for commercial urban mesh networks. The proposed technology will benefit military and civilian avionics systems, enable automation platform expansions and enable commercial broadband internet applications, particularly airborne internet systems. All of these anticipated applications present attractive market opportunities for UCs technology.",

        "abstract": "Advanced Cerametrics, Inc (ACI) has developed a new ceramic material to compete directly with the very high priced reaction bonded silicon nitride (RBSN) and obsolete Pyroceram radomes. ACI has built on earlier work done by NAVSEA to develop a repeatable and inexpensive process to produce radomes from Barium Alumino Silicate (BAS) using high temperature eutectic BAS fiber as a reinforcement for the BAS matrix ceramics and then, in order to make a sandwich structure, backfilling with an aluminum phosphate coating for erosion resistance and dielectric enhancement. These window materials must withstand temperature rises to > 1300 0 C in a few seconds, while being electronically compatible with missile systems and erosion resistant to Mach 6 raindrops. Very few materials meet these criteria. BAS has been shown to be an acceptable candidate and the proposed work will continue qualification of the material ongoing from the Phase I and an earlier program, while optimizing its properties in actual radome structures. The DOD prime supports this program fully and will cooperate every step of the way to get these new window materials qualified and in use in the fleet as soon as possible. Full size radomes will be built, based on data provided by ACI cooperative partners, and these will be evaluated to prepare for real time testing by the end of this Phase II effort.

        "abstract": "Some modern gas turbine engines utilize integrally bladed rotors (IBR), sometimes called blisks (bladed disks), in the design of the fan and compressor. IBRs are unique because, during fabrication, the airfoil blades are bonded to a hub to form an integral structure, which offers performance benefits over the conventional dovetail design. There are many instances in operation when foreign object damage (FOD) to airfoils leads to the need for a partial or blend repair process. In some cases, material is added to restore lost strength and subsequently machined to reshape the airfoil; and in other cases, the integrity can be restored by simply blending out the FOD and rebalancing the component. Small damage is repaired using various patch-repair techniques. There are strict limits for which partial repair may be used, driven by the location and extent of the damage; and when the limits are exceeded, a decision must be made to condemn the component or apply a full-blade repair process. A full-blade repair requires the airfoil to be cut off and a new full-blade reattached, using a solid-state joining process. The critical nature of these components requires that the new joint of the full-blade repair be free of defects such as internal porosity, planar low-density defects, and surface nonconformities. Good joining procedures and statistical process control are effective in producing defect-free joints; however, NDE techniques must still be employed on a periodic basis to ensure that the structural integrity of the repaired joint is acceptable. The main challenges are that the inspection area has limited accessibility, the object varies in contour, and it has a changing cross section. Keystone is proposing to use pitch-catch ultrasonics and advanced eddy current NDE techniques to assure full coverage, detect the different potential defect types, and provide the required sensitivity.  BENEFIT: This NDE technology will provide the Air Force and OEMs a NDE method for detecting potential anomalies on the bond joint resulting from the blade replacement repair procedure on an IBR. This proposed process will be applicable to all engines using IBRs in the engine fan and compressor. Large commercial engines are now being designed and brought to market that also have IBRs in the fan and compressor; therefore, it is anticipated the proposed technology will also have commercial engine applications in the future.",

Isolators are critical elements for optical systems, since backscattered light creates noise and laser source instability, particularly in integrated platforms where the potential for backscattering increases with device density. Despite the need for integrated optical isolators, practical realization of such devices is challenging due to the lattice mismatch between materials, such as yttrium iron garnet (YIG), utilized to fabricate bulk magneto-optic isolators and materials, typically InP or GaAs, used for integrated photonics. In the Phase I effort, we have designed and modeled a surface-plasmon enhanced optical isolator capable of producing 30dB isolation that can be integrated with standard III-V semiconductor materials. In Phase II we propose to implement this surface-plasmon isolator design in InP and demonstrate the large isolation and low insertion loss.

        "abstract": "Applied University Research, Inc. (AUR) is proposing to develop a state-of-the-art prototype wind velocity vector instrument for measuring the near-field flow of models under test in large-scale high-speed wind tunnels. The instrument under consideration is based upon laser-Doppler velocimetry (LDV), but with modifications to enable sub-miniaturization of the laser-emitting probe head and that leverage the use of recently-developed advanced photonics components. A Phase I study which preceded this proposal examined the feasibility of the technique for the proposed application. It was shown using structural and optical analyses that the concept of employing thin, formed windows is a robust and cost-effective solution for providing optical access through wind tunnel models. The results from the Phase I tests and analyses led to the conclusion that the proposed instrument is feasible for prototype development and deployment in large scale wind tunnel facilities--the subject of the currently proposed project. The highlight of the proposed work is the delivery and demonstration of a fully-operational subminiature LDV probe with robust support photonics and controls that require very little user adjustment for day-to-day operation.  BENEFIT: An array of customers may benefit from the improved flow sensing capabilities of the sub-miniature laser-Doppler velocimeter (SMLDV). The product would provide advanced testing capabilities for an important US aerospace facility, the Arnold Engineering Development Center 16ft Transonic Wind Tunnel, for obtaining crucial information about the highly dynamic flow the occurs near bodies in flows. Additional facilities of importance within the US such as the National Transonic Facility located at the NASA Langley Research Center and the 11ftx11ft Transonic Wind Tunnel at the NASA Ames Research Center would also benefit from the capability to measure flow velocity vectors using a probe mounted within wind tunnel test models. The probe and support hardware are robustly-designed and operate within difficult environments which may include large fluctuations in temperature or pressure. The feature of robustness opens the possibility for in situ measurements within jet engines or mounted in test aircraft to obtain external flow profilesat real-world flow scales that are of interest to engineers. In addition to aerospace applications, the automotive industry has many complex internal and external flows that a turn-key high resolution measurement system could address, such as the performance of window defrosting systems and cabin noise.",

        "abstract": "Standoff weapons such as seeker missiles enable strikes at targets of opportunity in limited-access areas while minimizing risk to warfighters. However, seekers cannot be deployed quickly enough for these short-notice, opportunistic missions because of two limitations of their onboard ATR systems: 1) ATRs cannot learn from novel, mission-specific data after initial training is complete; and 2) ATRs cannot identify pertinent, non-redundant information from large training databases. These limitations make it impossible to train a seeker\u2019s ATR in a feasible timeframe for short-notice missions.  To remedy these problems and make short-notice seeker missions a reality, we propose Learning and Mining using Bagged Augmented Decision Trees (LAMBAST). LAMBAST examines large databases and extracts sparse, representative subsets of target and clutter samples of interest. For data mining, LAMBAST uses a variant of decision trees, called random decision trees (RDTs). RDTs are immune to overfitting and can incorporate novel, mission-specific data after initial training via perpetual learning. We augment these trees with a distribution modeling component that eliminates redundant information, ignores misrepresentative class distributions in the database, and stops training when decision boundaries are sufficiently sampled. These augmented random decision trees enable fast construction of reliable, mission-specific ATR and make short-notice seeker missions possible.",

The system will employ two primary components: 1) a high performance electro-optic (EO) device to steer a laser beam and 2) a passive \u201csuperprism\u201d that amplifies the EO steering angle. The superprism is a breakthrough technology that uses a photonic crystal (PC) structure and exploits the superprism effect in PC structures. The resulting device will lead to high-speed, high-reliability, beam steering systems with no moving parts suitable for deployment on missile systems, space platforms, small, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and laser communication systems.",

TEMBOREG Reflectors incorporate non-tensioned graphite composite membranes that are formed using conventional construction techniques and stiffened using CTD's TEMBOREG shape-memory composite panels to allow practical packaging and deployment without complex mechanisms.  The simplicity of the design provides a significant cost advantage when compared to existing deployable reflector technologies, (4-fold cost reduction over mesh antenna and 2-fold reduction in manufacturing time) and the continuous graphite surface enables high frequency antenna operations at Ka band and above.  CTD can stow either a Cassegrainian (center-fed) or Gregorian (offset-fed) 5m TEMBOREG Reflectors in a Falcon 1e launch vehicle. To moderate cost and fabrication time, the TEMBOREG reflector is supported by a deployable backing structure.  In the proposed Phase II effort, CTD will further refine innovative backing structure developed in Phase I as well as to develop additional precision capability to enable both the high frequency (Ka band and above), large aperture (5 to 8 meters) performance required for near-term and future NASA programs.",

        "abstract": "This proposal addresses the need for instrumentation that can resolve strain and temperature distributions around small features of interest on high temperature, metallic and ceramic gas turbine components with curved surfaces. Two parallel optical approaches are outlined; laser speckle metrology for measuring strain, and phosphor thermometry for measuring temperature. The proposed methods are suited for use on both coated and uncoated specimens, and will be designed around thermo-mechanical fatigue test facilities under development elsewhere. The Phase II work will bring several innovations to each of the proposed technologies. One particularly innovative aspect is the prospect of depth resolved lateral strain imaging within and through a ceramic coating. In Phase I the various technical feasibility issues have been addressed, such that the success probability of each procedure can be estimated.  BENEFIT: The proposed speckle metrology systems each have significant potential for strain measurement on representative materials and structures encountered in modern high performance aerospace gas turbines. Furthermore, temperature imaging with thermographic phosphors shows the potential to have high accuracy and precision. Therefore, the combined instrumentation should enable the acquisition of thermomechanical fatigue test data in a practical and cost-effective manner that is superior to other, non-optical methods. The proposed instrumentation is sufficiently versatile to be directly applicable to a very broad range of other applied mechanical problems. As a result, a considerable commercial potential exists, and the proposed work provides an ideal opportunity to explore this.",

In Phase I, POC confirmed the feasibility of HAS by developing the device and demonstrating its ability to maintain dexterity in human volunteers in a controlled cold environment (~-1 degree C) for 4 hr. In contrast, dexterity decreased dramatically in volunteers who did not wear HAS. In Phase II, we plan to optimize the existing HAS prototype and demonstrate its effectiveness and ease-of-use with extensive testing on human volunteers.",

However, once the initiation occurs, fatigue cracks can propagate rapidly resulting in increased spall rate in Pyrowear 675 races. This aspect of the fatigue properties of Pyrowear 675 has not been studied in great detail. \u00a0In this Phase II SBIR project, UES proposes to identify the key properties of Pyrowear 675 such as microstructure, compressive residual stresses and near-surface fracture toughness that control the spall propagation rate by analyzing new and failed bearings. \u00a0Also, computer modeling and simulation will be used to understand the role of dynamic operating conditions such as load and speed on the spall propagation.

        "abstract": "The proposed Phase II effort includes tasks designed to both promote the development of an effective multi-application Hand-held device and to provide a fieldable solution for a relevant corrosion application such as the in-situ monitoring of corrosion on rotorcraft-gearbox-mounting pads using embedded MWM-Arrays. In order to expand on the multi-use aspect of the Hand-held device beyond MWM sensor technology, significant effort will focus on compatibility with existing EC probes. Design work initiated within the Phase I effort will continue into physical layout and prototype fabrication. Functional, performance, manufacturing, and field usability testing and evaluation will be used to develop a plan leading to final product deployment. Detailed specifications for the target application will be defined in order to develop an appropriate strategy for incorporating an MWM-Array. Based on these specifications, an appropriate test setup, simulating relevant application parameters (e.g., materials, corrosive environment, etc.), will be developed as a means of evaluating potential field capabilities. The results will also be used to develop a deployment plan for on-aircraft use.",

        "abstract": "The current command and control paradigm for management of air traffic is highly dependent on voice communication. This approach has benefited the development of Air Traffic Control (ATC) over the last century in many ways, including a low-level of required aircraft equipage and the ability to handle contingency situations and adapt to new requirements easily. However, the reliance on voice communication in ATC operations presents challenges to the use of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UASs). The remote pilot must interpret each ATC command, direct the aircraft accordingly, and communicate the appropriate response back to ATC.  In this proposed effort, we apply advanced speech recognition concepts to the interpretation of ATC communications to enable autonomous communication between ATC and the Unmanned Aircraft (UA), removing the remote pilot from the communication loop between the UA and ATC.  The key challenge in this approach is to ensure the required level of accuracy and reliability of the ATC speech recognition. To achieve complete autonomy, the UA must also be able to generate and transmit an appropriate response to ATC clearances. Thus, we do not require a speech recognition capability alone, but, rather, we require a fully autonomous command and control capability on-board the UA.  BENEFIT:   A number of potential opportunities exist for the UAACS technology including integration into future UASs, or as a retro-fit into current UAs, as well as application to civilian ATC automation system needs. The UAACS technology has the potential to reduce the workload of the UA remote pilot during airfield ground operations, while allowing mission planning to be conducted more efficiently, insofar as ground operations planning is concerned. In the civilian ATC market, there are many situations in which ATC clearances are only specified by voice command and are not entered into a computer system. In such situations, both ATC computer systems and aircraft-borne computer systems do not have access to the clearance requirements. The Automatic ATC Speech Recognition capabilities could be directly applied to this market need.",

        "abstract": "Layered sensing concepts will significantly increase the number and types of sensors available for ATR, but at the same time the ISR problem is becoming become more difficult (e.g., thousands of targets, dismounts, urban terrain, extended operating conditions). To exploit fully these new sensing capabilities, it is necessary to develop multi-sensor resource management algorithms capable of computing near-optimal tasking decisions in real time for thousands of targets and dozens of sensors, and be responsive to changes in sensor performance capabilities versus different target types and operating conditions. To develop such a multi-sensor resource manager Parietal Systems, Inc. (PSI) has developed innovative multi-armed bandit algorithms in Phase I to compute efficient far-sighted solutions of the sensor allocation and scheduling problem for target search and classification. In Phase II PSI will extend these algorithms to integrate tracking with search and classification and to operate in a distributed decision-making environment with multiple users sharing common sensor assets. The effort will evaluate algorithm performance tradeoffs for different operating conditions, and demonstrate the algorithms both in PSIs virtual reality ISR simulation and in an AFRL evaluation system.  BENEFIT: The research will produce real-time, distributed multi-sensor resource management algorithms that can be used for the next generation of sensor fusion and ATR systems, which will actively manage sensor resources across multiple platforms and multiple users. The sensor management algorithms will thus benefit the development new multi-sensor systems for military and security applications, but also the development of commercial multi-sensor fusion systems for detection and classification (biosurveillance monitoring, medical diagnosis, cargo inspection, inspection of infrastructure, etc.).",

        "abstract": "Comprehensive COOP strategies have taken on increased emphasis due to evolving threats, including the increasing threat from cyber warfare and terrorism and the ever-present threat from natural disasters and other forms of disruption. \u00a0As DoD architectures become more net-centric and globally distributed, our dependence upon continuously available distributed services continues to grow, emphasizing the need for robust COOP and cyber defense solutions. Unfortunately, existing COOP/SOA solutions are complex, inflexible, costly, and lacking in capability, as currently demonstrated by long delays, ranging from hours to days, between failure and full restoration of critical operations. \u00a0In addition, a recent Air Force Capabilities-Based Planning brief identifies two relevant AFRL Technology Gaps: \u00a0Fighting through a Cyber Attack and Cross-Domain Cyber-Threat Reconnaissance. \u00a0Securborations Policy-based Recovery on Virtualized Enterprise Networks (PROVEN) addresses these gaps and overcomes these problems. PROVEN is a proactive solution that supports COOP and cyber defense in a SOA environment. \u00a0PROVENs key innovation is the use of semantic technologies to dynamically infer recovery procedures and policy, based on the semantic meaning of enterprise data. \u00a0This approach overcomes the limitations of current approaches, which rely on known static structures, procedures, and hardware redundancy to support recovery.  BENEFIT: PROVENs key innovation is its flexible approach to continuity of operations that leverages a semantically consistent model of the operational environment to define and execute policies, including times of conflict and/or crisis, to maintain mission essential services at all times. \u00a0This semantic model defines and enforces policies across the entire SOA, and all services are automatically managed and executed in accordance with the defined policies. \u00a0The use of semantic technologies to dynamically infer recovery procedures and policy based on the semantic meaning of enterprise data overcomes the limitations of current data-centric approaches, which rely on known static structures and procedures and a greater degree of human intervention to support recovery. This innovation results in these primary benefits: 1. PROVEN reduces cost to deploy and support new or modified services. 2. PROVEN provides a greater capability than other COOP approaches. 3. PROVEN is a proactive approach the only way to ensure continuous operation is to act prior to failure. Collectively, these benefits illustrate that PROVEN provides both a strong COOP solution and a strong foundation for robust cyber defense.",

Specifically, the project advances high energy density cells by focusing on increasing the energy density of these cells. Our high-energy air cathodes, with an increased oxygen diffusion rate, are incorporated into the cells. Several areas to optimize the cells have been identified and will be investigated. These cells produce power by the lithium reacting with the air cathode. This significantly decreases the weight by consuming oxygen from the air. Yardneys experience and technologies in oxygen cathodes and powers sources will be adopted in the design of the lithium-air batteries. Advantages of the proposed lithium-air battery include: a safe design, high energy density, a lightweight design, and a high energy density cathode.  BENEFIT: The proposed high energy density lithium- air battery has the potential to be used as a lithium-air battery or a lithium-oxygen battery (like a fuel cell). The lithium-air battery could provide energy storage for Solar Power Generation Systems, UAVs, small robots, and aerospace equipment. This technology may also be used to power vehicles on the land, air or sea, and even space. The lithium- air batteries are adaptable to powering electronics. Lithium-air batteries have the potential to replace fuel cells and batteries currently used to power electronic equipment. The strength of the system is its very high energy density. Its lightweight nature and flexible design provide adaptability to many commercial products such as cell phones and computers.",

        "abstract": "Clean drinking water is a critical component of the United States infrastructure and is therefore a potential target for terrorists.  In addition to physical attacks to the water network, like dams, pumping stations and pipelines, there must be vigilance to prevent the water itself from being fouled with toxic/hazardous chemicals.  It is virtually impossible to protect every river, stream or lake that contributes to the nation\u2019s drinking water supply; therefore rapid detection of a chemical/biological attack followed by rapid remediation is paramount.  Many toxins are deadly at very low dosages (low ppb or less for chemical, 1-100 cts/mL for biologic), requiring sensitive and precise measurements.  Immediate on-site identification and action precludes the transport of samples to a laboratory setting.\n\n\n\nThis program will demonstrate a handheld sensor that could also be potentially used in-line.  This sensor is based on Surface-enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS); the ability of SERS to detect chemical warfare agents was demonstrated at EIC Laboratories during the Joint Services Agent Water Monitoring program.  In the Phase I program, SERS detection of a wide variety of chemical warfare agent simulants and degradation products as well as several pesticides and other TICs was demonstrated.  Unique identification of each analyte was shown and ROC curve analyses were performed on some agent simulants.  The ROC curves demonstrate that SERS can detect the analytes of interest with a high degree of sensitivity and selectivity.  The highly encouraging Phase I experiments performed showed very few false positives and very few false negatives.  The Phase II program will engineer and fabricate a compact, full range high resolution totally automatable SERS spectrograph with sampling accessory for rapid (~60s) field identification and quantification of aqueous toxins.  The throughput and stray light rejection abilities of the instrument will be defined as will the precision of the SERS sensors.  An expanded library of TICs will be collects and ROC curves generated.  The program will culminate with testing against a chemical warfare agent during the ETV option.\n\n\n\nThe Phase I results are extremely encouraging and point to the possibility for a fieldable instrument that can rapidly identify and quantify chemical warfare agent or toxic industrial chemicals that have entered the water supply.  Although developed for Homeland Security measures, this sensor can also be used to monitor cleanups of toxic spills or pesticide/fertilizer runoff from nearby farms.  The sensor could also be extended to biological contaminations.",

Current Air Force technologies for managing workflow require a large investment of expert time to build and maintain workflow models. This jeopardizes AF missions.

MIMOD will passively monitor and automatically model the workflow of individuals and teams. MIMOD uses a hierarchical, context driven, hypothesis testing approach to gathering data and constructing workflow models. An interactive display will allow experts to inspect and tune MIMOD workflow models. \u00a0  BENEFIT: When fully developed, MIMOD will offer the following enhanced capabilities to military and civilian personnel: Monitor impaired or overloaded resources across the socio-technical network responsible for mission execution and share with individuals the inpact of that failure. Provide operators with the resources they need to do their job, e.g. priorities could be assigned to resources supporting a given mission. Assess the consistency of an operators behaviors within the implicit guidelines of command at any given time.Help identify critical coordination points, such as how users are tied together and how they impact each other.

To enhance the collection and exploitation of tactical HUMINT, soldiers need a tool to identify, assess, and dynamically alert them to false and inconsistent testimony gathered during an interview.  We propose to design, develop, and evaluate a Tool for Assessing and Conveying Testimony Veracity (TACT-V) that will allow HUMINT collectors to rapidly assess and convey the contextual veracity of source testimony.  For this effort, we will leverage our significant experience developing intelligent systems for Military Intelligence (MI) activities and exploit our access to MI experts to create a tool that leverages Bayesian reasoning over networks representing source testimonies to associate overlapping testimony, identify inconsistencies within those overlaps, and generalize source reliability based on these inconsistencies.",

The feasibility of the 3.5\" and 4.5\" apertures using smaller elements was already evaluated under the Phase I effort. During the proposed Phase II effort, Applied EM will take advantage of the novel GPS antenna (1\" in diameter) developed under Phase I to realize a small CRPA (S-CRPA). A new feeding structure is proposed designed to minimize inter-element coupling as well as carrier phase and code phase biases. Further, a new reference mode is proposed delivering much greater gain and survivability.  BENEFIT: Applied EM will capitalize on the military demand for small anti-jamming antennas for helicopters, UAVs, etc. GPS is becoming increasingly popular in automobiles and for other personal uses. A miniature GPS antenna system with anti-jamming capability would be of immense commercial use for integrating into personal vehicles, hand-hand held devices, wireless systems, etc.",

        "abstract": "The team led by Luna Innovations proposes to continue the development of the superlens lithography that will achieve 25nm resolution at a 193nm wavelength for high resolution photolithography used in IC production in military and commercial applications. The unique design of the proposed superlens provides a means to overcome the problem of the absence of natural, high-quality metal and sufficiently transparent dielectric materials with close absolute values of the real part of dielectric permittivity. The suggested unique, cost-effective processing will overcome the problem of tight alignment tolerances. In Phase I, the design of the superlens structure was developed and it was demonstrated through modeling that the proposed structure is capable of reaching 20nm resolution.  In Phase II, the team proposes to fabricate the superlens structure, experimentally demonstrate at least 25nm resolution at 193nm wavelength, develop/optimize the patterning process and demonstrate, for the first time, the patterning of the device wafer with superlens lithography.  By the end of Phase II, a prototype superlens and photolithographic process with resolution better than 25nm will be demonstrated. In Phase III, Luna will commercialize the developed technology. The developed technology will revolutionize the semiconductor processing thus benefiting the semiconductor industry, US economy and US DoD.",

        "abstract": "Two important Navy trends are agile, rapid response operations and reduced manning. These trends require fewer warfighters to access and assimilate more information about more tasks, to multi-task, and supervise automated and semi-automated systems. Net-centric systems help by providing access to tremendous amounts of data from many systems and reach-back assets, but these data must be organized and harnessed to exploit them fully: to manage attention and situation awareness across multiple tasks, switch among tasks and recover from task interruptions, and collaborate to solve problems and share workload. The Janus project proposes to address these concerns by explicitly supporting supervision and multi-tasking. Janus provides displays that present mission and system status information and significant changes efficiently so that they can be assessed within a brief glance while continuing to perform primary tasks. The Janus displays lie on the periphery of users\u00d5 workspaces where users can scan them quickly to survey mission status. The Janus project also provides a toolkit and design process for composing appropriate supervisory display. This design process significantly increases the generality of the Janus approach so that its superior designs for supporting supervision can be applied readily to many domains.",

        "abstract": "In the Phase I program we successfully demonstrated the feasibility of the Pulsed ElectroGasdynamic (PEG) thruster for attitude control and orbital maneuvering. In this thruster, propellant gas is introduced into the thrust nozzle through a fast acting gas valve where a short, high voltage pulse is applied to break down and heat the propellant gas. The heated gas expands in the nozzle generating a high impulse (~mN-s per pulse) at a high specific thrust (120 \u00a3gN-s/joule). The specific impulse (Isp) will be in the range of 500~1500 sec. This process can be repeated at a frequency to meet the spacecraft thrust requirements. The thrust generating mechanism of the proposed thruster is gasdynamic expansion, not magnetohydrodynamic interaction. The proposed thruster is different from the conventional pulsed electrothermal thruster in that the joule heating of the propellant takes place as the propellant gas expands through the divergent nozzle, thereby eliminating the heat and momentum losses at the nozzle throat.

This environment will be designed to streamline processes at the NASA Ames Mission Design Center. Several key concepts are introduced. The proposed environment introduces modern Product Data Management and Product Lifecycle Management (PDM/PLM) tools and processes to satellite mission design. Specifically, the notion of product structure, or bill of material (BOM), is expanded to a simulation BOM, or SBOM, with the capability to manage engineering analysis data, files and processes in the context of a product, in this case satellite mission. This approach constitutes a significant step beyond mere document management, which limits the traceability of which model of which analysis belongs to which version of the geometry or other analysis. It is a key enabler for model re-use. A Linked Model Environment (LME), i.e. an environment where all engineering analysis models are associatively linked, which was developed concurrently in the commercial aerospace and automotive industry, will extended to satellite mission design. This environment significantly reduces the amount of manual intervention engineers have to perform to translate information from one simulation tool to another. The concept of digital mockup (DMU), which typically addresses form and fit of components in an assembly, is expanded to include function, such that the inclusion of components in a satellite assembly that are functionally incompatible is rejected. Repetitive-iterative engineering tasks will be automated with the help of an integration framework tool which automates the execution of a sequence of codes and provides the capability to wrap drivers like optimizers or quality engineering tools around an automated analysis workflow.",

The SDK will provide central IPU capabilities: a) continuous calibration with respect to each other, b) seamless rendering and projection of panoramic, dynamic imagery. The SDK will be compatible with several rendering-display configurations. The benefits of the proposed innovation will overcome several deficiencies of current projection and visual training systems, including \u2022 the laborious process of manual setup and calibration of projection geometry, \u2022 the inability to adapt to even small changes in the display system geometry (e.g., projector shift due to shipboard motion, geometric surface perturbations, etc.) without suspending operation and repeating the setup process, \u2022 the requirement for planar or custom display surfaces, and \u2022 the need for a pre-set fixed viewpoint. The SDK will compensate for such deficiencies with the automatic geometric and photometric configuration upon startup, both intra- and inter-IPU, as well as the automatic continuous refinement and adjustment of imagery in response to geometric and photometric perturbations of surfaces and/or IPUs. Furthermore, the rendering can be adjusted for static or changing viewpoint.",

        "abstract": "The F-35 main weapons bay experiences severe acoustic loading when exposed to the freestream. The severity and attenuation of this loading is exacerbated by the very complex geometry of the weapons bay and the highly non-uniform approach flow. This extremely harsh aeroacoustic environment can also impact components that are mounted within the bay itself, including carriage stores that contain sensitive electronics and control surfaces. CRAFT Tech proposes the development and demonstration of a robust, highly integratable flow control strategy that effectively lowers the high dynamic loading of the F-35 main weapons bay, while minimizing additional aircraft weight. This hybrid strategy, entitled HyFACT, considers flow control techniques applied to either the forward or the aft portions of the bay, producing attenuation over the entire subsonic and supersonic flight envelope. Phase II will involve technology maturation through high-resolution Large Eddy Simulation (LES), complemented by comprehensive wind tunnel testing. The noise suppression technology will be scaled-up to flight. A full-scale, flightworthy HyFACT demonstration prototype hardware will be developed and delivered to the Air Force for flight-testing on the F-35 aircraft.  BENEFIT:   The Phase II F-35 flight demonstration of the HyFACT noise suppression system, which will reduce flow-induced cavity acoustic loads to acceptable levels without significantly impacting the aircraft weight, will provide the necessary proof-of-concept for future technology commercialization. CRAFT Tech will engage in strategic partnering and licensing with airframe prime contractors and/or sub-contractors. CRAFT Tech will provide the knowledge, expertise and understanding necessary to develop HyFACT kits for the F-35, based on the success of a follow-on flight test.

        "abstract": "Large volume, immersive simulation environments provide a compelling way to train and simulate operational systems. \u00a0To provide realism to these training scenarios, tracking the absolute location (both position & orientation) of both the player under training and the devices that the player must interact with becomes important. \u00a0In multi-user training environments, each player must also know the absolute locations of the other players for a successful training mission. \u00a0In immersive Virtual Reality (VR) training with multiple users in a fixed environment, the absolute position and orientation of the head, weapon or virtual handheld devices (i.e. virtual binoculars) are not as important as resolution, latency and weight. \u00a0For Augmented Reality (AR) training, the position and orientation of the display needs to be tracked accurately relative to the same world coordinate system in which objects in the environment are mapped. \u00a0We are proposing autonomous tracking solutions that offer a wireless and networkable approach to instrumenting multiple players and devices in an indoor environment with minimal tracking reference infrastructure. \u00a0Differing from Military Operations in Urban Terrain (MOUT) type tracking approaches, the proposed solutions will meet or exceed AR-type tracking accuracies of 0.1 degree in angle and 3 mm in position.  BENEFIT: If a tracking system can be developed that integrates with COTS networked wearable computing equipment with minimal or no infrastructure set-up, then this same equipment can be used in a field simulation training system with an added benefit over conventional location-based simulators: it can be deployed in the field and used to maintain skills without returning to U.S. training camps, or even to perform specific mission rehearsal scenarios just before a military operation. If furthermore this tracking system can be made battle-hard and covert (does not emit sound, RF, or NVG-detectable infrared radiation) then it could potentially have dual use in both field-deployed training and actual military operations. Our approach is extremely low-cost, easy to integrate with a wearable computer and headset for simple VR or AR interaction by using advanced vision-based wide area tracking, and provides the proven robustness, resolution and low latency of MEMS inertial tracking.",

Information regarding target behavior may be drawn from a variety of sources, each of which suffers from uncertainties in the form of noise, inaccuracies, and outright errors. This proposal seeks to develop novel methods for dealing with this uncertainty by vertically integrating uncertainty models in a common framework through all levels of data processing, by adapting uncertainty models over time to incorporate newly observed behaviors and interactions, and by leveraging powerful new adaptive processing techniques. The resulting technology will propagate uncertainties from inputs and models, producing a distribution over anticipated behaviors and a characterization of the most likely future target tracks and associated likelihood measures. These distributions are used to detect objects whose behavior pattern is anomalous relative to the models learned from previous observations.  BENEFIT: The ability to accurately anticipate vehicle behavior on the basis of surveillance data is critical in many military and civilian contexts. In particular, behavior anticipation can form the basis of algorithms that identify vehicles whose behavior is atypical or is consistent with some undesirable behavior. In a military setting, a number of behavioral cues are often associated with insurgent operations, including reconnaissance, suicide bombings, and deployment of improvised explosive devices. Similarly, in a civilian setting atypical driving behavior is frequently the initial cause for traffic stops that uncover more serious illicit activities. Examples include unusually slow or excessively fast speeds, erratic driving, failure to stop at traffic lights, etc.",

This program will coordinate flux compression generator simulations with gas breakdown theory and simulations. Flux compression generator numerical modeling tools will provide time-domain evolution of electric fields, magnetic fields, and current densities. Gas breakdown modeling will show if stray conducting paths through the gas are present for specified gas pressure. Several hypotheses are discussed in this proposal to explain why FCG voltage tolerance is poor.  Improvements to gas chamber preparation, and coil design, expected to increase FCG voltage tolerance are proposed. The theory of breakdown of magnetized electronegative gases is described.

Our approach for the 2 \u00b5m source was a compact linear resonator that demonstrated 65 mW of single frequency output compared to a goal of 20 mW. Our approach for the 1064/532/355 nm source was intracavity second and third harmonic generation in a compact 1064 nm ring laser that demonstrated simultaneous single-frequency outputs of 520 mW at 1064 nm, 240 mW at 532 nm, and 1.9 mW at 355 nm. The goal was > 1 mW at 355 nm. For Phase 2 we propose to build more hardened engineering demonstration units of the lasers, to develop electronics that could be readily transitioned to radiation hardened designs, and to demonstrate a frequency locking module for the 1064/532/355 nm source.

For improved reliability and to assure stand-alone functionality, the network would support a real-time 3D location function using site-assisted navigation and utilizing TOA/TDOA methods.  To achieve unparalleled power consumption efficiency, Lexycom proposes the use of QoS-aware, data traffic dependent waveform selection.  We have estimated that additional reduction in power consumption can be obtained by utilizing cognitive selection of the operating mode of the EVA transceivers.  We plan to use an innovative RF packetization technique targeted toward eliminating negotiations between the network nodes prior to the change in the parameters of the transmitted signal on a packet-by-packet basis.

        "abstract": "The objective of this Phase II project is to design, implement and demonstrate an innovative secure cognitive wireless communication/jamming system. This system will integrate multiple advanced signal processing, communication and electronic warfare countermeasure technologies together to create total spectrum dominance for military applications. The proposed cognitive communication/jamming system will be able to (1) provide highly secure wireless communication links for friendly transmission; (2) effectively jam and destroy hostile wireless communication; and (3) optimize the spectrum usage efficiency and minimize power consumption for portable devices. Specifically, a cooperative spectrum sensing algorithm will provide a virtual RF topology map of a hostile environment. Next, important RF parameters and localizations of hostile transmissions will be determined. With the aid of the virtual RF topology, a polyphase carrier interferometry waveform is designed to provide secure wireless communication links for intended transmission and jam hostile transmission simultaneously. A multi-carrier based non-contiguous RF watermarking technology is implemented to significantly improve the performance of the intended wireless transmission. A polyphase carrier interferometry jamming technology is implemented to effectively destroy the hostile transmission by transmitting with identical RF parameters. A smart antenna array is integrated with the RF watermarking technology and jamming technology to provide a oscillating beamforming and offer transmit diversity \u00a0to provide superb performance improvement and significant jamming directionality. Most important, multiple smart antenna arrays are combined to create a virtual grid, generating a distributed, prioritized RF watermarking technology. As a direct result of these innovative research and development, the proposed wireless communication technology not only provides high performance and high security against both passive eavesdroping and active jamming from adversaries, but it eliminates hostile transmission as well. By combining secure communication for intended users and strong jamming capability towards adversaries together, we will achieve total spectrum dominance in a portable and flexible manner. In addition to theoretical and numerical analysis, the proposed cognitive wireless communication/jamming technology will also be implemented in hardware via DSP/FPGA/SDR boards to demonstrate its superb performance and exceptional security feature.  BENEFIT: This high performance high security cognitive radio and cognitive jamming technology has a large potential for both military and commercial applications. While the primary DoD application is to enhance the security, reliability and jamming capability of military wireless communication and network, this technology can also bring higher security and performance to current commercial wireless communication networks. The novel spreading spectrum technology, along with the intelligent spectrum sensing technology, is capable of increasing the spectrum efficiency of ISM bands and licensed bands, offering a unique and promising solution to spectrum congestion problem facing the wireless communication industry. The RF watermarking technology can be integrated into current commercial wireless networks to significantly improve their security. Specifically, the distributed RF watermarking technology can significantly improve the security vulnerability of current IEEE 802.11a/802.11g/HyperLAN II based wireless local access networks. Other possible commercial application areas include Wireless Personal Area Network, cellular network and satellite communications.

A significant percentage of the structures used in these spacecraft will be made of composite materials, and the Ares V payload shroud will be one of the largest composite structures ever built.  This offers many challenges, not only for design and manufacturing, but also for inspection and maintenance.  Inspection of large composite structures using traditional NDE methods is time consuming, expensive, and often not possible when access is limited (e.g. covered by a thermal protection system), resulting in a conservative (higher weight) design.  Acellent proposes to develop a robust, state-of-the-art structural health monitoring (SHM) system to overcome these concerns.  The Phase II will optimize the design and quantify the benefits for SHM on the Ares V payload shroud, and then expand the results to include other Ares V components such as the Altair Lunar Lander Structure, Earth Departure Stage (EDS) payload adapter, forward skirt and intertank, and the Core-to-EDS interstage.

As a consequence, there exists a great need across government, military, and private sectors for a robust means for the early detection and analysis of behavioral changes and attack precursors. To address this need we are pleased to submit this proposal to design, develop, and evaluate an Attack Centric Autonomic Detector of Insider Adversaries (ACADIA). Following the recommendations of the GIG IA Independent Framework Technical Reports Alternative I: Host Monitoring and Detection, Network Analysis (2000), we will focus on the prevention of insider attacks using redundancy, artificial diversity, and multi-layered policy mechanisms; ACADIA also detects unusual activity and social-behavioral changes by monitoring and aggregating cyber-activity data at the host level and by performing analysis and anomaly reporting at the network level. Our Phase I effort demonstrated that ACADIA has the potential to provide early predictions and detection of the occurrence, of insider misuse and attacks.  BENEFIT: All users of military, government, and commercial cyber infrastructures are potential insider threats to those infrastructures. An effective solution for detecting, monitoring, and preventing insider threats and specifically a system that detects attack precursors thus allowing an organization to react in time to prevent an attack can be used by these organizations to protect information assets from cyber attacks such as data exfiltration, data corruption, and other forms of sabotage and industrial espionage.

The models must be reconstructed for each new geometric and loading application. Rather than using empirical fatigue data to fit the model, the VEXTEC approach uses the intrinsic microstructure properties of the material and needs very little calibration testing. In Phase I, VEXTEC used the model to predict RUL for a flat plate specimen in a four point bending stress state to within 95% confidence of the test results. The simulated data were generated in less than 2 weeks.  These RUL results show that the VEXTEC model can be universally and efficiently applied to new airframe components of the same material with high accuracy.  The model was shown to use the particle density material property along with other properties measured from the material to predict the number of microcracks propagating through the microstructure of the material. The Phase II will create a comprehensive RUL prediction system by expanding the capability. Further refinement and added fidelity within the VEXTEC models will produce higher confidence RUL prediction results while maintaining the cost and speed advantages over current modeling systems.",

Before this can happen, however, it is essential to significantly improve the reliability and trustworthiness of existing and envisioned sensor networks. During operations, the sensor network must be robust to deception, node compromise, and various other attacks, while maintaining the operators situational awareness regarding the health and integrity of the system. To address these needs, we propose a Framework to Ensure and Assess Trustworthiness in Sensor systems (FEATS) to identify attacks on sensor system integrity and inform the operator of sensor data trustworthiness. The framework provides for three critical functions: 1) attack detection via anomaly detection algorithms, including statistical rules and unsupervised learning, 2) probabilistic threat assessment incorporating the current operational context using Bayesian belief networks, and 3) trust management provided by a human-system interface that uses meta-information visualization to portray the trustworthiness of a sensor network.  BENEFIT: We expect the full-scope Framework to Ensure and Assess Trustworthiness in Sensor Systems (FEATS) to have immediate and tangible benefits to both the federal government and the private sector.

        "abstract": "Due to the remarkable benefits provided by 802.16 Broadband Wireless Access (BWA) networks, military interest in such technology has consistently grown. However, preplanned base station locations with tall towers and directionally-optimized antennas are not tactically useful. Therefore, in order for the military to leverage commercial wireless technologies, these technologies must be adapted for a tactical environment. In this project, we will address these challenges and develop the Multi-hop Base Station Mobility Management Scheme (MBSMMS) which will provide support for the mobility of base stations in a tactical environment. The proposed MBSMMS is an improvement/amendment of the current IEEE 802.16j standard that offers efficient mobility support for BSs and provides backward compliance to the commercial 802.16 technology. IST has assembled a distinguished team to address this proposal. In conjunction with our university research partner, we are proposing a novel and innovative approach to meeting the requirements called for in the solicitation. At the conclusion of Phase II, we will have a pre-production version of our product ready for immediate deployment in selected applications.",

        "abstract": "Existing cognitive performance test batteries consist of synthetic tasks that, while they may probe isolated cognitive functions, provide an incomplete and unconvincing picture of an individual's true cognitive capacity within the total context of space missions. In essence, they are 'laboratory' measures that appear unrelated to the real-world environment. This leads to user non-compliance or rejection. The present proposal describes a technique for integrating traditional cognitive performance measures with assessment of the system and mission in which the individual must operate. This yields quantified measures of the person's cognitive ability to perform specific jobs in space. Specifically, an entertaining and scientifically rigorous assessment tool is integrated with a sleep/fatigue model and a quantified workload estimate for each task. This is accomplished by selecting tests based on task analyses of what the astronaut actually has to do, using the Fatigue Avoidance Scheduling Tool (FAST) to predict performance capacity as a function of sleep/rest, and integrating a mathematical vector to quantify the workload of specific tasks. The resulting \"Person-System-Mission (PSM) index\" provides a totally new and unique way not only to assess present cognitive capability, but to diagnose specific causes of decrement, and to suggest remedial actions.",

The results of our Phase I definitely indicate that we will be able to reach this goal.  These materials are being made from new nano-composites, using fabrication techniques developed at Eltron. \n\nThe thermoelectric composite's matrix had already demonstrated exceptional ability for functioning in the environment of space.  Used in a cooling system, these materials will provide an effective means for controlling the temperature of surfaces subject to the rapidly changing temperatures encountered in space.  We have proven that this matrix works exceptionally well at providing support and allowing for convenient (and therefore economical) deposition of our materials.  We have also demonstrated that the thermal conductivity in these new nano-materials has been reduced by well over an order of magnitude!  In addition we have shown that we get an increase in the Seebeck Coefficient for materials we tested as well.  These new thermoelectric materials can be used to prevent development of large temperature gradients and thereby prevent the mechanical stresses that accompany them.  Used for power-generation, these new materials will be very efficient because of the properties that both the nano-phase materials and its matrix bring to the thermoelectric material.  Because of the difficulties presented in the harsh environment of space, thermal management and power generation is most easily provided through devices that do not have any moving parts, are very durable, do not require maintenance, and operate efficiently over a wide range of temperatures.

        "abstract": "As air-breathing combustion applications advance, increased use of fuel for cooling, combined with cycle advancements, leads to a situation where the fuel can become superheated. While this can lead to potential benefit in terms of the eventual fuel injection process, with enhanced atomization and evaporation, it creates a significant challenge relative design of a system to successfully exploit this behavior.  Further, existing computational design tools have not be sufficiently validated to predict the behavior of superheated liquids.  Dealing with the superheat behavior in the injection of a liquid fuel requires substantially more physical phenomena to be accounted for compared to a subcooled system. As a result, detailed data and models for this behavior as encountered in practical fuels are needed in order to validate and evolve the models needed. In the work proposed, emphasis will be given to the injection of a plain liquid jet under superheated conditions. Building from the successful Phase I effort, the behavior of internal liquid and external spray in both quiescent and heated crossflow environments will be studied.  The models evolved will be incorporated into an existing simulation environment developed by ERC for atomization of liquid jets. In addition, data will be available for CFD validation.",

        "abstract": "Several high-fidelity computational schemes and turbulence-combustion interaction models, including the option for high-order spatial and temporal calculations, are proposed to significantly improve the accuracy and turnaround time for practical scramjet engine design and performance analysis. The proposed enhancements of existing tools, such as the government-owned VULCAN computer program, focus on accuracy, speed of execution, and general user interaction with the tools. The project targets issues associated with physics-based modeling of supersonic combustion, aerodynamics, turbulence, and their interactions, with the overall goal of providing accurate and computationally affordable tool. To develop the proposed software, TTC Technologies, Inc. (TTC) is leveraging its extensive experience in the relevant research for the topic and in developing truly advanced computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solutions at all speeds (subsonic, transonic, supersonic, and hypersonic). TTC will also partner with ATK GASL, Inc., who will provide quality dataset to validate the proposed tool, and leverage its extensive research and realistic scramjet manufacturing experience.  BENEFIT: Supersonic combustion is a vital, application-driven field of research, occurring in supersonic ramjets (scramjets) and rocket engine devices. The extreme operating conditions of these applications, such as Mach 4 through 7 for scramjets, and ambient vacuum, for rocket engine ignition, make ground-based experimental measurements very expensive and difficult. The use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) could potentially play a vital role as an important complement or a substitute for experiments. Therefore, TTC''''s proposed high fidelity scramjet combustion software will add significant value to realistic scramjet design and performance analysis, with high accuracy and fast turnaround time. Moreover, the nature of the proposed software is such that its marketing synergizes with that of TTCs other software products, including its flagship CFD tool, AEROFLO. Both government and private sectors will find the proposed software to be very valuable. \u00a0DOD and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) will find it beneficial for their various projects on hypersonic air vehicle concept screening. The expected accuracy and robustness of the procedure also assures reduced time, risk and cost for commercial development of hypersonic propulsion capability for access to space using hydrocarbon fuels.

        "abstract": "During cold weather operations tasks requiring manual dexterity can become significantly more difficult as the drop in temperature causes capillaries in the fingers to rapidly contract, decreasing skin blood flow and leading to stiff, sore fingers.  IST addressed this issue in Phase I by developing an intelligent electrically heated fingerless glove, specifically designed to keep the fingers both unencumbered and warm. This system contains a network of heating elements made from highly flexible electrotextile materials. The path that these elements took within the glove was chosen to maximize the efficient transfer of heat to the hand. This allowed those regions of the fingers that are critical to performing manual tasks to be left uncovered. By using electrotextile materials for the bus bar and heating elements rather than conventional wires IST was able to significantly improve system comfort and flexibility. The heating system is controlled by a flexible power supply that is able to maximize user comfort and minimize power usage by regulating its output based on the temperature within the glove.

Polyimide's composition affords high transparency to x-rays, especially above 3 keV. Phase 1 prototypes demonstrated 11-15% higher transmission than comparable nickel mesh across the UV-Visible-NIR range.

        "abstract": "During Phase I, MARK Resources very successfully demonstrated the feasibility of a Future Combat System ground vehicle performing ground-to-ground non-cooperative combat identification using data collected by its Multi-Function Radio Frequency radar.  The demonstration of feasibility applies more generally to wideband Ku-band and Ka-band vehicle-borne radars. The identification processing extracts target features that persist over large changes in target orientation, are insensitive to target articulation or configuration, and can be easily obtained from photographs for a comparison database.  Examples include target dimensions, whether or not a vehicle is tracked, and number and positions of wheels. We demonstrated the accurate extraction of these and other features on radar data of stationary and moving vehicles, at cruder range and Doppler resolutions than would be available operationally, using several different vehicles at a variety of aspects.  We also demonstrated that the extracted features and achieved accuracies allow target identification within a large set of combat vehicles, by comparing actual feature values for the set. During Phase II, we propose to refine and automate the Phase I algorithms, and to demonstrate that the automated algorithms can provide high-confidence identification of both stationary and moving vehicles under operational conditions for the MFRF radar and FCS vehicles.",

        "abstract": "In today\u2019s dense electromagnetic environment, proper allocation and management of spectrum is an overriding concern for US military forces. The migration to higher microwave and millimeter-wave frequencies has made much needed bandwidth available for military radar and communications. This migration, however, has also highlighted the need for high-performance filtering to mitigate jamming and co-site interference. This has translated into the need for frequency-agile filters with narrow fractional bandwidth that still possess reasonable losses. To this end, this proposed program will marry the highest performance MEMS technology, that of microencapsulated, capacitive MEMS switches, with the lowest loss transmission media, that of metal waveguides. these two technologies- one old and one new- will enable tunable filters at Ka-band frequencies which overcome the present limitations of tunable filters with unloaded Qs in the range of 50-150. This novel component technology will usher in a new generation of MEMS-tuned filters with narrow bandwidths, low loss, and high intercept point. This will be of great benefit to next generation military radar and communications systems where adaptive frequency management is required.",

This design is optimized to spectrally separate the aerosol and molecular backscatter for the calculation of the aerosol-to-total-scattering ratio and aerosol extinction coefficient.  Additionally, wind and temperature data products can be produced with this system.  The proposed Phase II efforts are directed at designing and building a bench-top HSRL 532nm receiver that is capable of taking accurate measurements of aerosol scattering ratio, extinction coefficients, molecular temperature and line-of-sight (LOS) velocity.  This demonstration unit will verify a new adaptive interferometer measurement technique, called the Programmable Edge Technique (PET), which makes use of a Digital Micro-mirror Device (DMD) in conjunction with a Fabry-Perot interferometer and two photo-multiplier tubes (PMT).

In Phase II, OSI proposes to design, fabricate and test a prototype optical vertical profile system for atmospheric turbulence and crosswind measurements to provide critical atmospheric parameters for wake vortex decaying forecasting modeling.  Several scintillometers will be built with the goal to demonstrate their ability to meet performance, size, weight, and packaging requirements for airport operations. An analytical and field test program will be conducted for further performance improvement of a vertical profile vortex detection system using optical scintillometers to measure near ground level crosswind, turbulence, and wake vortex on an airfield.  The results of  near ground vortex measurements plus the ground vortex measurements by double-ended optical scintillometers will provide the necessary assessment to design a crosswind, turbulence, and vortex detection system as a decision support tool for NASA's Airspace Systems (AS) Program to improve airport capacity and safety.\n \nThe vortex detection system could also measure downdraft on the runway. The instrument will provide real-time continuous measurements of convergence and divergence along the runway. Vertical winds, and hence the downdraft, can be derived from the measured divergence. The proposed vortex detection system will also be able to provide critical large area wind information.

In fact, solid state lighting, high-temperature and high-power electronics, microelectronic and mechanical sensors, and high-efficiency solar cells are all poised at a new level of development. This enormous market is waiting for low-cost, high quality substrates to achieve performance and fabrication economies of scale. After achieving dislocation densities below 1E7 cm-2 in the phase I work, this NASA SBIR phase II project addresses the development of a dislocation filter that can routinely prepare low-stress GaN thin films with threading dislocation densities below 1E6 cm-2. The method relies on using a low-angle ion beam to induce both nanofilter for defect reductions and to inhibit droplet formation at low growth temperatures. Dislocation densities have so far been determined by standard etch pit densities method. The goal the project to optimize the multiple defect nanofilter with smoothening by transition layers in between filters to reduce the TD to less than 1E6 cm-2 and process, fabricate high performance HEMT for solid state high power amplifier (SSPA) applications. To obtain a more practical evaluation of the effectiveness and commercial viability of the method, heterojunction field effect transistors with high electron mobility will be fabricated in these ultra-low defect density films. These high-quality material based high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) will enable high linearity power amplifiers with excellent thermal stability and frequency response. The proposed method to grow on low-stress, low-dislocation density films will lead to the production of electronic devices of unparalleled performance.",

Such a network will be capable of modifying its own behavior in response to changing network conditions to satisfy its users requirements. \u00a0According to this vision, the resources for which the network is responsible include not only the traditional nodes, ports, packets, and interfaces, but also the content of the information it carries. \u00a0The central focus of our proposal is a cross-layer network architecture, the sharing of information between layers of network function that have traditionally hidden their information from one another, as a unifying principle for solving the problems of one-to-many and many-to-many data exchange over an unstable wireless infrastructure. \u00a0We utilize network coding principles and tools to improve network reliability and capacity for one-to-many and many-to-many information exchanges. \u00a0We also identify the key helper technologies that will act together to make the architecture real: Software-Defined Radio, the Click Modular Router software, a unifying framework to implement an adaptive network stack, and a Cognitive Engine for network state-sensing and decision-making.  BENEFIT: The founding vision of mZeal is to make real the possibilities of autonomous mobile networking, and all our work is guided toward that goal. The CAN-DO architecture is an incremental step in that direction, following logically from our previous work with adaptive applications for tactical MANETs. CAN-DO will incorporate the technologies that we have determined to be most critical to accomplishing our corporate goals, including a flexible and extensible cognitive reasoning capability, a framework for gathering and reporting information using mobile intelligent agents, and a conceptual cross-layer model of the network that allows us to implement novel solutions to the novel problems posed by node mobility and self-government. \u00a0We see our near-term commercial opportunities in the places where the challenges to networking are most difficult - in tactical military operations on the ground, sea, and in the air; in search and rescue operations; in many aspects of emergency response in challenging environments, indoor and outdoor. We are excited by the opportunity to work with iRobot Corporation, because we are sure that the technical capabilities and the goals of the two companies are not simply compatible but truly synergistic, creating a whole greater than the sum of its parts. The immediate relevance of robotics in CAN-DO is to the participation of unmanned vehicles in the network, but outside the military arena, robotic vehicles have applications in the other areas we named as well. In our vision, anywhere that people cannot or will not go, robots can and will. \u00a0The purpose of any network is to disseminate useful information to people (and devices) who need it. This is why our first products were adaptive applications; the first problem to solve is to deliver information in usable form. CAN-DO will be measured by that standard, and our commercialization decisions will be driven by that understanding. \u00a0We see two avenues to commercialization of CAN-DO. One avenue is to package the components in preconfigured form for particular applications; we can imagine, for instance, emergency response vehicles with additional special intelligence about forest fires or hazmat spills. The other avenue is to offer system integration services to resellers or end users.",

        "abstract": "Titanium with its inherent lightweight, corrosion resistance and mechanical properties is a critical and strategic metal in civilian and defense aviation, oil extraction and processing, water purification, the general chemical industry, and would be in automotive transportation if it were more economical.  The entire world\u2019s supply of titanium as a sponge has been produced by the Kroll process for over a half century.  The Kroll process is the magnesium reduction of titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4).  The Kroll process is a low productivity, batch, segmented, labor intensive process in which the operations are generally carried out at separate sights resulting in high cost storage, handling and transport of the environmentally hazardous materials chlorine (Cl2), titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4), molten magnesium (Mg), and molten magnesium chloride (MgCl2).  The purpose of this research was to develop a continuous low cost innovative alternative to the Kroll process that utilized the same production demonstrated Kroll chemistry to produce high value added titanium powder which eliminated the environmental hazardous materials and which meets environmental benign green manufacturing standards. The alternate processing to eliminate any storage, handling or transportation of the hazardous reactant materials consists of producing a titanium suboxide-carbon material by carbothermic reduction of an ore/TiO2 producing Ti:O:C in a stoichiometric ratio such as Ti2OC.  This Ti:O:C serves as an anode feed to a MgCl2 electrolysis cell where the electrolytically generated chloride ion at the anode reacts with the Ti:O:C to in-situ produce TiCl4 that is dected to the cathode surface where the electrolytically generated Mg reduces the TiCl4 to titanium powder and regeneration of the MgCl2.  Since this is a cyclic system, the feed to the cell is Ti:O:C with Ti powder continuously produced and the elimination of separately handling any hazardous materials.\n\n\n\nThe Phase I program demonstrated the in-situ process in a bench scale cell on a continuous basis as well as producing a Ti-B alloy powder.  An economic analysis suggests that the environmentally benign process can produce titanium powder for approximately $1.35/lb.  The Phase II program is to scale-up processing with operations on a continuous basis to demonstrate commercial viability and confirm low cost processing that meets environmentally benign green manufacturing standards.  The produced powder will be independently analyzed to establish ASTM grade and will be provided to outside sources to quality for direct use in powder metallurgy fabrication as well as melting for equivalency to Kroll sponge processing.  The commercialization option will scale to the pilot stage to demonstrate commercial production capability, confirm environmental benign green manufacturing capability, the economics of the process, and confirm the produced titanium powder is at least equivalent to Kroll sponge quality.",

The EPA promulgation of National emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) from Industrial, Commercial and Institutional Boilers and Process Heater will require industry to install many new high performance precipitators on such sources in the coming years.\n\n\n\nThe Plasma Discharge (PD) Electrode is an innovative technology intended to replace the conventional corona discharge electrodes in electrostatic precipitators.  With the PD electrode, precipitators for small oil and coal fired boilers could be made significantly more efficient at removing fine particulate matter from their effluent gases.\n\n\n\nPhase I research has shown that PD electrodes are capable of increasing the useful electrical power input to a precipitator by 42% and improve uniformity of current distribution by 200%.  This promises to result in a twofold improvement in performance of an existing precipitator and a corresponding reduction in the cost of a new precipitator installation.  Phase I testing also verified that the PD electrode can function in coal fired boiler exhaust gas streams.\n\n\n\nThe proposed Phase II research will demonstrate this improved performance on a pilot scale precipitator installed at a coal fired power plant.  This will be done by measuring the particulate collection efficiency of a precipitator equipped with conventional electrodes and then measuring the collection efficiency of the same precipitator when fitted with the new PD electrodes.\n\n\n\nThe commercialization option will result in the retrofit of a full scale precipitator field with PD electrodes.  When completed successfully, these two milestones would be sufficient to bring the technology to commercialization.  It is anticipated that the PD electrode technology will be licensed by Neundorfer Particulate Knowledge, a leading supplier of aftermarket precipitator services in the US.\n\n\n\nThe design of the PD electrodes lends itself to use with electrostatic precipitators with very little change to their basic design.  If demonstrated at full scale and technically successful, the PD electrode could become standard equipment in electrostatic precipitators installed on small industrial boilers.  The improved performance they afford would decrease particulate emissions to atmosphere and/or decrease the cost of the precipitator installations.

Water sources for these communities are from ground and surface water with flow rate up to 50,000 gallons per day for a community of 500 people.  To improve upon this water treatment process, the EPA desires improved novel filtration and chlorination methods that can disinfect and filter these drinking water sources.  To address this need, Reactive Innovations, LLC conducted a Phase I SBIR program to develop an on-site hypochlorite generator to continuously chlorinate surface groundwater.  During the Phase I program, we showed that our electro-chemical reactor technology can produce hypochlorite for varying water flow rates upwards to 50,000 gallons per day and required disinfection levels up to t ppm of equivalent chlorine.  The major focus of our water chlorination unit is to minimize its initial and operating costs, thus, the system has few components other than the hypochlorite reactor,  a tank of salt, and a power supply, All of the process water flows through the electrochemical reactor to produce bleach in situ with the flowing water stream and, thus, eliminates slip stream pumps and control systems.  The improved design of our electro-chemical reactor will help to lower the system cost, one of the major drivers for deploying a water disinfection system into the marketplace.  For the Phase II program, we will scale the hypochlorite generator to larger process flow rates, continue minimizing the system complexity and cost, and develop operational hypochlorite generations systems that can operate unattended for one-year at process rates of 50,000 gallons per day.  Commercialization of the technology will be done in concert with water equipment manufacturers and water system providers.  Verification of the technology will be conducted via an outside organization through the EPA\u2019s Environmental Technology Verification program.\n\n\n\nThe immediate application of this electrochemical reactor technology is toward an improved chlorination process for small communities in Puerto Rico.  The modular design of the reactor technology will allow us to scale it ot medium and large water disinfection systems as well as scale it ot produce higher levels of sodium hypochlorite for wastewater cleanup.",

In Phase I, of this WBIR program, a new gas leak visualization camera was demonstrated using Agiltron\u2019s infrared image sensor, which our company has under advance development and expects to manufacture in large volumes at much lower cost than any existing technology.  In Phase I, using methane as an example target gas, we were able to detect leaks on the order of 10SCFH with only ambient IR illumination, by using our sensor together with proprietary methods of optical filtering and image processing.  Building on this proof of principle, the Phase II prototype will be 10X more sensitive and entirely free of false alarms.  The final product will be smaller, lighter, and much less expensive than any competing system, about $2,000 end user cost compared to $70-100K for currently available solutions.  This will enable wide distribution in industries such as refineries and pipelines and for local businesses, including natural gas maintenance, supermarkets, and automotive and HVAC repair shops.  In addition to methane, a wide variety of gases with absorption bands in the 6-12 &mu;m IR range can be detected including SF6 and refrigerants, supporting compliance with EPA regulations for VOC and greenhouse gases.

        "abstract": "Ammonia has an important role in the chemistry of the atmospheric environment and air quality.  Ammonia emissions are a major environmental concern, yet they remain poorly quantified.  There is a need for a sensitive ammonia instrument to monitor emissions and evaluate their effects on local and regional environments.  An instrument capable of continuous monitoring is required to understand diurnal patterns, trends, and correlations of ammonia with other atmospheric species including particulates.  This instrument needs to be portable, operationally simple, and affordable to be relevant to widespread ammonia measurements.\n\n\n\nIn the Phase I program we demonstrated feasibility of developing a lower cost, highly sensitive compact instrument for autonomous real time monitoring of ammonia.  The instrument is based upon Tunable Infrared Laser Differential Absorption Spectroscopy (TILDAS) using Quantum Cascade lasers.  We identified two possible cell designs for the instrument:  an in-line astigmatic multipass cell design and a second novel cell design using low cost components.  We have designed lower cost collection optics and simpler cooling approaches for the laser and detector.  The incorporation of these innovations and a novel cell will lead to a lower cost, more commercial air monitoring instrument for ammonia and other important atmospheric tract gases.\n\n\n\nThe objective of the Phase II project is to fabricate and demonstrate a fully functional, affordable, highly sensitive, rapid response, robust and portable instrument for autonomous real time monitoring of ammonia.  The instrument will have compact size to fit in a rack mountable box and be capable of long term monitoring.  The instrument will use mid-infrared quantum cascade laser absorption to accurately quantify ammonia with a precision of 0.3 parts per billion (PPBV) in a 1 second measurement without cryogens or calibration gases.  The reduced cost ammonia monitor will be possible with the develop-ment of our novel multipass absorption cell. The cell will allow design of an instrument that is reduced to its optical essentials\u2014little more than a laser, an absorption volume and a detector.  The cell will be either an in-line astigmatic cell or a novel proprietary multipass cell based on low cost components.\n\n\n\nThe development of a sensitive, affordable instrument for ammonia detection has wide benefits for atmospheric and environmental research.  This novel compact QCL instrument will have extensive commercial applications in areas such as air pollution and air toxics monitoring, regulatory monitoring, breath analysis for medical diagnostics, combustion exhaust research, and plasma diagnostics for semiconductor fabrication.",

        "abstract": "Biodiesel is a fuel that is made by processing vegetable oil or animal fats into a liquid fuel that can be combusted in a standard, unmodified diesel engine.  The use of biodiesel reduces CO2 emissions by over 80% compared to petroleum and it reduces our dependence on foreign oil while promoting economic opportunities in rural America.  When biodiesel is made from low-cost waste oils or fats the environment benefits are even greater.  However, the growth of the domestic biodiesel industry is limited because the current production processes requires a highly refined (expensive) low free fatty acid vegetable oil, and the cost of biodiesel is almost entirely determined by the cost of the feedstock.  Furthermore there is a limited supply of vegetable oil over and above what is needed for food and animal feed.  TDA Research has identified a new process that should solve these technical problems, utilizing unused waste feedstocks and reducing the price of biodiesel.  The process, which uses process-intensification to combine multiple chemical reactions in a single vessel, runs well on very low cost, high free fatty acid waste and recycled oils and fats.  The Phase II project will operate and fully characterize a laboratory scale version of the process, and determine optimum operating conditions and the economics of producing large quantities of biodiesel.  The environmental benefits that specifically address EPA programmatic concerns, Including (1) reducing CO2 emissions from on-road and farm diesel engines; and, (2) providing a technology that converts waste into fuel, reducing land fill mass.  The results of the Phase I project include process performance results, and a detailed engineering and economic analysis.  In Phase I we determined that a 20 million gallon per year production plant could produce biodiesel at a product cost of $2.63 per gallon (from waste oil).  It is anticipated that in Phase II we will further develop the pilot process, evaluate possible waste feedstocks, confirm the catalyst does not lose activity and prepare a more detailed engineering and economic analysis that will be used to market the process.\n\n\n\nCommercial Applications\n\nThe commercial application is a new process for making biodiesel from low-cost (waste) feedstocks. The U.S. biodiesel industry is expected to saturate at around 1 billion gallons per year using excess refined vegetable oils, but taking advantage of currently unusable waste oils and fats will allow the industry to grow beyond that level.",

        "abstract": "Electronic waste (e-waste) is one of the most rapidly growing waste problems worldwide.  Improper handling of e-waste results in vast amounts of toxic waste being sent to landfill and leaching into the water supply.  Due to there concerns e-waste recycling is a rapidly growing industry.  Unfortunately, most current e-waste recycling processes rely on either manual hand sorting or differential density sorting methods.  Manual hand sorting is expensive in the U.S. and has been associated with major environmental damage overseas.  Differential density sorting is expensive and is not very effective for sorting e-waste plastics.\n\n\n\nWhen properly sorted there are a significant amount of valuable recyclable materials in e-waste.  Recycling rates for e-waste are currently low in part because e-waste recyclers charge a fee for recycling in order to make a profit.  Legislative action in many states may increase this rate, but the long term viability of e-waste recycling depends upon economical approaches to recovering theses valuable materials.  E-waste plastics often are difficult to re-use in part because of the inability to separate those materials which contain brominated flame retardant.\n\n\n\nThe objective of the proposed Phase II research is to complete development of the technology successfully tested in the Phase I research.  In order to assist in funding the deployment, testing, and further development of the prototype systems the proposing firm has obtained a commitment form an e-waste processor which has agreed to cooperated with NRT in the development and testing of the technology with Phase III funding.\n\n\n\nA significant increase in the anticipated amount of e-waste has been observed over the last few years and is expected to continue as the time between introduction and obsolescence becomes continually smaller.  Because most electronic devices contain a significant number of plastic parts with and without flame retardants separation and recovery of these materials is crucial for long-term viability of environmentally friendly recycling of e-wastes.  It is anticipated that upon the successful completion of this Phase II research that the application of the technology will improve the costs of recycling e-wastes, improving the rate at which e-wastes are recycled.\n\n\n\nThe proposing firm is a major manufacturer of recycling equipment of the post-consumer plastics recycling industry and has received considerable interest in the development of a sorting system for sorting brominated plastics in e-waste plastics.  Due to this interest the proposed technology is expected to have a strong market in the e-waste recycling industry.",

Unique features of this model include (1) the ability to model chemical kinetics in highly nonequilibrium flows at high altitudes, (2) the ability to predict nonequilibrium dissociation without reliance on traditional continuum kinetic rate equations, and (3) the ability to model complex reactions from fundamental molecular quantum models.  The model will permit analyzing high-speed, nonequilibrium flows about entry and aeroassist vehicles based on extensions to Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) codes, and a new database will be developed for these extensions.  The new approach offers potential for treating other complex nonequilibrium flow physics including ionization and radiation in a more direct manner than has been previously used and therefore offers potential improvements in accuracy.  These tools will provide essential data for assessing the aerothermodynamic performance for a wide range of vehicle designs over a wide range of vehicle attitudes and flight conditions.

The goal of this project is to develop the next generation of Schlieren for Aircraft in Flight (SAF) systems. SAF is a technique for obtaining schlieren images of aircraft as they fly past the edge of the sun. In its original form, images were recorded with a time delay and integration (TDI) camera using slit masks that conformed to the edge of the sun. Problems arise if the cutoff mask is not precisely aligned with edge of the sun, or if the TDI camera is not aligned and synchronized with the aircraft flight path. These problems can be solved using the synthetic TDI method, where the aircraft transit of the sun is recorded on high-speed video, and then the TDI process is carried out computationally using programmable masks. Synthetic, TDI-based SAF systems are less sensitive to movement of the observation platform, and can be used with non-cooperative targets whose flight paths and velocities are not known in advance.",

Traditional time domain terahertz reflection tomographic imaging captures only a single view of an object, generating images of laminar structure similar to an ultrasound \"B-Scan\".  This reflection tomographic imaging is limited, however, in revealing only the laminar structure which presents a clear specular reflection from each interface.  Furthermore, traditional time domain terahertz reflection tomographic imaging has substantial difficulty in determining the layer index of refraction an absorption properties without ambiguity.   In Phase 1 we demonstrated the feasibility TD-THz  axial computed tomography to generate cross-sectional slices of aerospace materials.  This method acquires not one view, but many radial axial views, generating a sinogram which can be used to reconstruct images using a derivative of standard X-Ray CT filtered back-projection.  The sinogram can be generated by the transmission absorbance, transmission time of flight, and, in principle, reflection measurements.  The reconstructed TD-THz CT images are 3D maps of the absorption coefficients and/or the index of refraction of the subsurface material.",

These will be needed to increase the number of missions that existing levels of flight personnel must be able to handle. But PRL has few constructs to enable automated planners and schedulers to take advantage of the procedures resulting from PRL.

With extensions to AADL, users of the language and corresponding tools are afforded with the best of the architectural, model, and simulation worlds.

A lightweight sensor handling system with power to the deployed sensor and bi-directional high data rate communications is contrary to conventional surface platform design principles which use heavy tow cables, heavy depressors, or dynamic-lift depressors to achieve depth. The technology solution that is proposed here is a Propelled Tow Body (PTB) (powered through the tow cable) which achieves depth using forward thrust instead of weight or downward lift. The USV-PTB system will be designed to optimize the speed-depth towing profile while minimizing the motions transmitted from the USV to the sensor. This will be achieved using a unique control system developed by VCT.",

Once deployed this wing must have extremely high aerodynamic efficiency.  Out Phase I technical approach was based on an inflatable structure and a high tension membrane surface.  We were able to prove feasibility of the structure by analysis with validation by similarity to numerous large inflatable structures using proprietary AirBeam technology.  Aerodynamic efficiency was verified by wind tunnel testing of membrane wing models.  The values of rib spacing and membrane tension were shown to be critical for aerodynamic performance.  The proposed Phase II research addresses the next most critical technical challenge: in-flight wing deployment.  We will use a subscale inflatable wing to develop packing and deployment methodology that leads to reliable, controlled, repeatable wing deployment from a relevant annular stowed volume to a fully deployed, structurally and aerodynamically complete wing.  The test articles will include all relevant deployed elements, inkling cable bracing, control surfaces and actuation means.  All tests in this phase will be ground-based.

The Phase I program demonstrated that COMPACT is largely immune to harsh environmental conditions and is suitable for the practical rotorcraft environment.  The Phase II program will focus on adapting COMPACT to a suitable test region of a helicopter fuselage where flow separation is expected.  Scale models of the fuselage will be constructed and studied for both baseline and actuated flow conditions to study separation and attachment mechanisms.  Actuator modules will be developed for surface mounting onto existing fuselage designs for ease of integration and actuator performance characteristics and designs will be tailored to achieve desired flow control effects.

Cold Spray is an emerging technology being developed as a process to repair/restore the base metal for select components and/or to apply corrosion resistant coatings to various substrate materials including aluminum, magnesium and high strength steel alloys. A unique feature of Cold Spray is the relatively low process temperatures allowing the powder particles to remain in a solid state during the coating process. This avoids substrate melting and produces coatings with less oxide than thermal spray coatings of the same material. Cold Spray is an ideal process for applying coatings to heat sensitive alloys. This process is durable, economical, environmentally friendly, easy to implement and can be applied to complex-shaped aerospace components utilizing a portable spray system.",

Mayflower will, moreover, work with Airborne Network radio prime contractors to design RRTP interface with the Airborne Network radios in Phase II, and transition RRTP to these radios in Phase III.  BENEFIT: Civilian Airborne Internet is a promising application for RRTP. First responders and the various agencies in homeland security are also potential users of RRTP. In both these applications, RRTP can provide IntServ QoS for real time and critical information flows. In the military arena, RRTP can provide QoS-assured communication between mobile airborne platforms as well as with space and terrestrial networks, which are components of the Global Information Grid (GIG). By providing QoS-assured communication for mission critical flows in the Airborne Network and for the GIG, the QAHANT technology would be a key enabler in Network-Centric Warfare.",

A technical hurdle in the earlier-generation technology, of high solar absorptance (values up to 0.8) in the dark, high-emissivity state, remained, the sole hurdle hindering implementation of the technology. The Phase 1 introduced the new innovation of unique, proprietary IR-transparent coatings lowering the solar absorptance (Alpha(s)) of the variable emittance devices (\"skins\") drastically. In Phase 1, the best coatings yielded Alpha(s) of 0.306, emittance of 0.383 for the light state, and Alpha(s) 0.454, emittance 0.841 for the dark state (Delta emittance 0.458), with a calculated temperature under direct sunlight in space of < 60 C.  Devices endured thermal vacuum > 110 days, VUV, atomic-O exposure, abrasion tests. Calorimetric emittance measurements under space vacuum were identical to emissometer measurements in air. In Phase 2, the primary objective will be ground space qualification and a TRL of 7 or higher, with an extensive series of tests to include:  thermal vacuum, thermal cycling, solar wind, atomic-O, micrometeoroid, vibration, ESD. These will be done in our labs as well as at several partner labs, including two large aerospace companies who are Phase 2 commercial partners, and several outsourcing vendors.

La from University of Maryland propose innovative swarm intelligence (SI) based approach to scalable and robust design of tactical networks which has direct application to robotics. Basic idea is to demonstrate the effectiveness of ant-based multi-path routing for robust network performance and hence enhanced confidence in networked robotic system operation. In our proposed framework, cooperative behavior of ants will be leveraged to keep the robotic network functioning even during nodes getting destroyed, disabled, compromised, or captured by the enemy which is bound to happen as number of nodes increase in a network. Basic motivation comes from biology that a system should have built-in redundancy for optimal performance. Following this architecture we shall demonstrate a SI based network paradigm at work which facilitates the integrated design and robust operation of a complex network under unpredictable environment along with built in simulation and operational capabilities. Preliminary simulations show that our approach is very successful in doing dynamic load balancing in a network where nodes are limited in spatial regions and make intermittent connections under disruption tolerant network (DTN) paradigm along with exciting results in NetSim and IAI\u2019s robotic testbed called Distributed Control Framework (DCF).",

Considerable progress has been made with each successive generation of space suit design; from the Apollo A7L suit, to the current Shuttle Extravehicular Mobile Unit (EMU) suit, and the next generation Constellation Space Suit Element (CSSE).  However, one area of space suit design which has continued to lag is the fluid pump used to drive the water cooling loop of the Primary Life Support System (PLSS).  Conventional electric motor-driven fluid pumps are heavy, bulky, inefficient, and prone to wear and water contaminants.  A new pump type is needed.  In Phase I, the feasibility of reducing the power consumption of Lynntech's electrochemically-driven fluid pump by employing high conductivity hydrocarbon-based electrochemical membranes was demonstrated.

        "abstract": "The design and development of scalable panel-based phased-array radars requires the high density integration of solid-state components and adequate thermal mitigation within the array lattice constraints. The current integration technologies such as system-on-a-chip (SOC), multi-chip-module-deposition (MCM-D), and system-on-package (SOP), will help miniaturizing sub-modules for various functional layers of the system, but they are not the only solutions.  For large phased-array with scalable capability, they need a high density interconnect (HDI) platform to provide functional integration for board-to-board transitions and on-board interfaces with large input/output counts within a limited area constrained by the array lattice and efficiency of networking. The HDI platform is need to combine with advanced multi-layer board technology in order to integrate active devices, provide the required RF manifold, DC power and digital control to the array, while providing adequate heat sinking for the phased-array. In Phase II, a prototype sub-module will be developed utilizing the developed HDI platform which integrates active array components into a demonstration sub-array.  The developed HDI platform will be made to provide a compatible board-to-board interface and efficient network for the SOC, MCM-D and SOP technologies. The target frequency range is X-band, but the developed technology could be extended to other frequency ranges.",

        "abstract": "The term Integrated Systems Health Management (ISHM) is used to describe a capability that focuses on determining the condition (health) of every element in a complex system (detect anomalies, diagnose causes, prognosis of future anomalies), and provide data, information, and knowledge (DIaK) to control systems for safe and effective operation. Therefore, ISHM capability is achieved by integrating DIaK that can be distributed throughout the system elements. DIaK must be available to any element of a system at right time and within a proper context. The implementations of the ISHM in the past have primarily focused on data access, and have not emphasized the integration of intelligence across all elements that make up a system. In order to distribute DIaK effectively, the integrated system must have the distributed capabilities and they require effective network functions across the whole system. Mobitrum proposes to develop a Sensor Area Network (SAN) for ISHM to bring the distributed intelligences together across all elements within ISHM system. The proposed SAN can be mixed of wireless and wired architecture. In order to implement credible ISHM functions, SAN must provide ISHM with effective communication mechanisms using distributed and/or hierarchical architectures to deliver intelligence across all elements.",

However, a manual hardware implementation of a highly optimized FPGA design may require design times on the order of months, especially if the designers take advantage of advanced features available on many FPGA devices. In this work, we have propose a novel methodology and system level tool, BINACHIP FPGA, which generates hardware-software co-design applications by taking software applications in the form of binary and assembly code on a conventional microprocessor, perform high-level synthesis, and automatically generate Register Transfer Level (RTL) VHDL and Verilog code. The RTL code can be synthesized by commercial backend logic synthesis and physical place and route tools for implementation on an FPGA in the form of a hardware accelerator. The RTL code can be verified with a testbench that is automatically generated by the tool, using a simulation based methodology to verify the bit-true accuracy of the synthesized hardware. This revolutionary methodology can reduce the design times for new hardware-software co-designs from months to hours.

Likewise, the ability to experimentally characterize these phenomena is also limited due in part to the need to rely upon visualization tools which are inherently qualitative. As a result, the ability to validate predictions using these diagnostic tools is also limited. In recent years, visualization diagnostics have evolved substantially in terms of spatial and temporal resolution. The advancements, coupled with a tool to conveniently quantify the results obtained relative to the breakup process offer the potential for a marked increase in understanding of this phenomenon. The proposed effort will develop such a tool that will be applied to the problems of pressure swirl injectors and liquid injection into a crossflow. The typical characteristics associated with this type of liquid breakup, such as column/sheet flattening, bending, fracture point, dynamics, etc. will be automatically quantified using the tool proposed.

        "abstract": "Testing and evaluation of torpedo active search and homing performance in reverberant environments is best done by high fidelity simulation. We previously concluded that in order to provide high fidelity and computationally efficient broadband simulations of realistic reverberation, a new approach was required. Previous approaches were based on frequency domain-based spectral factorization, which could not easily be generalized to the broadband case and, at the same time, remain computationally feasible. This proposal describes a task with the goal of providing a time-domain based model of three dimensional reverberation for torpedo simulators. It has the capability of providing a computationally feasible simulation that contains the broadband case in a natural manner. This means that the bandwidth and any associated Doppler shifts will be correctly modeled without any approximations, unlike the spectral factorization approaches. A further advantage is that, contrary to the spectral factorization approaches, this time-domain approach is not limited to quasi-stationarity and Gaussianity. The result will be a processor that can provide time series that faithfully and accurately represent the outputs of the individual hydrophones for a multi-beam torpedo sonar receiver.",

Cross-cultural competence is critical to mission success, and traditional competence frameworks do not consider the unique demands of Army Soldiers.

This model describes affective, behavioral and cognitive competence development from general, to task-oriented, to mission-centric performance and is based on the mission demands of Army Soldiers in cross-cultural environments.  The model further incorporates several cultural and expertise-development frameworks.  In Phase 2, this model will be applied across Army mission sets, modified, and validated.  A blended approach will be taken to develop an assessment methodology that will include self-report measures, situational judgment tests, scenarios, and other metrics.  The model and metrics will serve as the basis for the Cross-Cultural Assessment Tool (C-CAT), an online program that will assess an individual Soldier\u2019s cross-cultural competence and provide customized, usable feedback.

In this project, we will develop taggant systems for two non-conventional weapon signatures. Taggants will have high chemical selectivity (avoids false positives), high chemical affinity (avoids flase negatives), tunable fluorescent properties, long term stability, and compatibility with common near infrared active and passive remote sensing hardware. Taggants consist of synthetic proteins selected in a high-throughput screen for their functional properties. These functional properties include optical properties and chemical selectivity/affinity. \u00a0Specific goals include: \u00a0> Generation of a taggant set. \u00a0> Set testing for selectivity, affinity, and optical properties with clear and reliable acceptance criteria. > Confirmatory testing for selectivity, affinity, optical properties, and environmental durability. \u00a0> Providing the system to the Air Force for testing, evaluation, and use.

However, the accuracy of learning algorithms often suffers in applications where there are special cases that learning algorithms systematically misclassify. \u00a0To address this, we propose a new twist to the machine learning approach to entity consolidation in which a domain expert provides knowledge to the system about special cases. This knowledge enables the system to create models that explicitly handle these types of cases. \u00a0\u00a0In a sense, our approach combines the best aspects of machine learning with ideas from the older rule-based approach to entity consolidation. The objective is to take advantage of the statistical characteristics of data sets, while making it easy to create commonsense inference models that can utilize these statistics for high accuracy matching. We believe this approach will significantly improve upon the state-of-the-art accuracy of entity consolidation, particularly for applications that involve heterogeneous data, where special cases are more common.  BENEFIT: The goal of this project is to develop a very high-accuracy entity consolidation system for aggregating entity data from multiple heterogeneous sources. \u00a0In order to make sense of data collected from different sources, it is necessary to understand which entities are being referred to in each document. \u00a0\u00a0Entity consolidation systems are intended to solve this problem, but it can be difficult because two documents may refer to the same entity using somewhat different terms. \u00a0Also, sometimes two different entities have the same name. \u00a0The work in this project addresses many of these difficult problems, so that entity consolidation can be done with high accuracy. \u00a0\u00a0Fetch Technologies is currently working with numerous customers in the background screening industry, the news industry, and various business intelligence markets that are interested in aggregating information about people, companies, locations, and other entities. \u00a0In addition, Fetch also is currently working with government customers that are highly desirous of developing advanced data aggregation capabilities as well",

No knowledge of the streamlines of the flow will be needed in order to calculate the local stress distribution; this will avoid the tracers needed with the oil-film interference approach.  Flexible patches of FRAP arrays, inexpensive due to simple, mass-production-compatible microfabrication techniques, will be interrogated using a light source and camera. FRAP will be independent of the flow species and applied as a very thin, flexible, adhesive material.  The Phase II goals will be to improve the design and fabrication of the sensors, fully calibrate taking into account competing effects such as normal forces and temperature, demonstrate feasibility in a wide range of test environments from subsonic to heated and cold supersonic, and provide prototype units to NASA.

Advanced 4-dimensional Common Operating Picture (4D COP) technologies are required to better support the cognitive challenges of these efforts. To address this need, we propose design, demonstrate, and evaluate user-definable 4D COP capabilities through a Four-Dimensional User-Defined Spatio-Temporal Enhanced Interface Toolkit (FUSE-IT). The FUSE-IT toolkit will allow AOC warfighters to rapidly define, explore, and exploit battlespace visualizations that are automatically correlated in time and space. Two major components comprise our approach. First, we will use an iterative, work-centered analysis, design, and evaluation process to develop 4D visualization and interaction methods for the presentation and manipulation of critical battlespace information and meta-information. Second, we will design these methods to support the fusion and display of heterogeneous information resources through a single, rapidly customizable user interface. We will assess the effectiveness of our approach by leveraging existing in-house, COTS, and GOTS components to rapidly design, prototype, and evaluate promising FUSE-IT visualization and interaction concepts in a spiral design and implementation effort.  BENEFIT: We expect the visualization, interaction, and customization methods embodied by the fully developed FUSE-IT toolkit to have immediate and tangible benefits across both government and commercial applications.

The proposed Phase II effort focuses on the development, implementation and demonstration of the novel Common Radio Resource Management (CRRM) technology, which was conceived in the COATRAN Phase I study. CRRM is devised to form a coherent view of the network performance, and utilize this knowledge to optimally manage the use of the multiple radios of the heterogeneous AF Airborne Network. In doing so, CRRM delivers highly reliable networked communications in the Airborne Network. The COATRAN CRRM technology, which has been proven feasible in the Phase I study for the Air Force application, has enormous potential for military and commercial applications.

Recent advances in sensor technology at NASA and other government laboratories, in academia, and in industry have led to the development of very small mass spectrometer detectors, as well as other analytical instruments needing high vacuum, such as scanning electron microscopes.  However, the vacuum systems to support these sensors remain large, heavy, and power hungry.  To meet this need, Creare proposes to build a miniaturized vacuum system based on a very small, rugged, and inexpensive-to-manufacture, molecular drag pump (MDP).  The MDP is enabled by the development of a miniature, very high-speed (200,000 RPM), rugged, low-power, brushless, DC motor which will be optimized for wide temperature operation and long life during this project.  The vacuum pump has performance that is well matched to the needs of the new generation of miniature analytical instruments.  The pump represents an order-of-magnitude reduction in mass, volume, and cost over current, commercially available, state-of-the-art vacuum pumps.  The new pump will form the heart of a complete vacuum system optimized to support analytical instruments in terrestrial applications as well as on spacecraft and planetary landers.  Furthermore, the miniature high-speed motor will be designed so that it can be used in a wide range of high vacuum pumps, including pure molecular drag, pure turbomolecular, and hybrid turbomolecular/molecular drag pumps that can be tailored to the requirements of specific missions and applications.",

Specific bands of interest are 225-1000 MHz and 1350-2700 MHz. These frequency bands are particularly vulnerable to signal cancellations due to multipath. Moreover, body worn antennas often lead to gain losses (as much are 10 to 15dB less gain). As result of these challenges, during Phase I, we studied multiple body worn antennas in the context of MIMO. Channel capacity, hemispherical power patterns and diversity gain were considered as part of the objective parameters and metrics for evaluating the body-worn antennas ensembles. We showed that even 2 antennas, when positioned appropriately, can deliver significant diversity gain of 15dB as compared to a non-diversity systems. More importantly, we carried out a careful study of 2, 4, 6 and 8 antennas in various mounting locations and determined their metrics at 550MHz and 300MHz. As a result of this extensive study (mostly theoretical, but measurements for single body-worn antennas were conducted for validation) we have determined best locations and specific capacity expectations. During the option period we will also implement a diversity module using selection combining (SC) and consider its performance under several modulation systems and body-worn MIMO scenarios. During Phase II, we will follow this study and results with a demonstration of a body wearable diversity antenna system for increased channel capacity and improve communication links. Concurrently, we will consider optimizations for various warrior outfits, with the goal of delivering a practical prototype for transition. Size, weight and Power (SWAP) will certainly be a focus in our efforts to realize practical diversity antennas for body worn communications.",

For low-power engines  (~1 kWe) operated on heavy fuels such as JP-8 or diesel, fuel atomization and/or vaporization is a key aspect of burner design.  Creare has previously developed fuel atomization technology compatible with JP-8 and diesel that addresses the fuel atomization issue.  In the Phase I project, we utilized our innovative fuel atomization technology to develop a proof-of-concept microburner scaled to interface with a 1 kWe Stirling engine and demonstrated the microburner using Jet-A and gasoline fuels.

However, these sensors gather so much data that the C2ISR operators are becoming overwhelmed and actionable intelligence is being lost in the wave of data. The solution to this problem is not to attempt to replace the human operator, but to leave humans to do what they do well while providing attention-focusing decision support systems that are able to reason about the Commanders intent and the current operational context. We propose to develop and evaluate a full-scope prototype architecture for Perceptual Sensing and Information Displays (PERSEID). PERSEID provides an integrated human/machine approach to creating decision aids that assist C2ISR operators. PERSEID provides an intuitive interface for C2ISR operators to describe the Commanders intent and relevant contextual information that the system incorporates into its C2ISR support tasks. PERSEID uses technologies and methodologies from the areas of cognitive modeling, evolutionary algorithms, and information/meta-information display to draw the attention of the operator to the most salient information.  BENEFIT: We anticipate several potential government transition opportunities, including to programs such as the DCGS-AF (Distributed Common Ground SystemAir Force), which integrates multiple intelligence systems into a single, worldwide network-centric enterprise, enabling interoperability and improved collection and delivery of ISR data.

Our Harmonization Framework (HF) couples tools, protocols, best practices handbook, and tutorials for cradle-to-grave automation and guidance throughout the service lifetime, from initial negotiation and relationship formation between service providers and users, to years of version management. \u00a0HF works with existing services or new projects.

During the Phase I program, 5-stage InGaAs APDs where shown to have a multiplication noise characterized by k=0.02 at a gain of M=20 (20\u00d7 lower than the k-value of commercial InGaAs APDs), operation up to M=2000 (100\u00d7 higher than commercial InGaAs APDs), and 500-ps pulse-pair resolution at a gain of M=100. Voxtel also demonstrated 10-stage InGaAs APDs of the same design which maintain silicon-like avalanche noise levels to a gain of M=1000. Efficient linear-mode single photon counting was performed with receivers assembled from the 10-stage APDs and commercial 2-GHz transimpedance amplifiers. In Phase II, Voxtel will optimize the multi-stage InGaAs APD structure for the best possible sensitivity at the eye-safe 1550-nm wavelength, develop a single-channel flash LADAR receiver chip capable of capturing eight pulse return samples per frame with 250-ps timing precision at frame rates up to 1.5 MHz, and demonstrate the resulting ultra-high temporal resolution flash LADAR receiver in a compact, fiber-coupled, and TEC-cooled package.",

        "abstract": "Emergent Space Technologies Inc. proposes to develop the Ground Enterprise Management System (GEMS) for spacecraft ground systems.  GEMS will provide situational awareness for distributed ground systems, and an understanding of how events and automated actions impact the system in real-time.  Recent software advancements have improved sustainability, extensibility, fault tolerance, and ease of automation for ground systems.  These traits are important for NASA's missions, from Exploration to Earth and Space Science, but can pose challenges, especially when the system has a high degree of interoperability and communications between components that isn't visible to the end-user.  Operators can quickly become overwhelmed with the increased complexity of software components constantly exchanging data and the volumes of information being passed around behind-the-scenes.  In fact, for largely distributed systems, as much \"situational awareness\" is needed for the ground system as for the spacecraft itself.  GEMS will provide a centralized integration framework that is needed to provide operators with transparency into the ground system, its state, and its component interactions.  GEMS will enhance plug-and-play integrations while providing information management and system coordination.  The innovation that enables GEMS is the development of \"data-driven\" algorithms and software adapters that gather data from the various components of the ground system to construct a data model that captures the system state, organizes the data, and displays it to the mission operators.",

The goal of this SBIR program is to enhance the operating tolerance of high efficiency III-V solar cells by employing nanostructured materials in advanced device designs.  A larger fraction of the solar spectrum can potentially be harnessed while maximizing the solar cell operating voltage by embedding thin layers of narrow band gap material in a higher band gap matrix.  Nanostructured devices thus provide a means to decouple the usual dependence of short circuit current on open circuit voltage that limits conventional solar cell design.  While previous experimental work on quantum well or quantum dot solar cell devices has typically employed GaAs as the wide band gap matrix, we take a different approach, instead employing InGaP as the barrier material.  During the Phase I effort, we observed that thin InGaP layers can be extremely effective at reducing the dark current.  A novel device structure resulted in over a 100 mV enhancement in the open circuit voltage of GaAs PIN diodes solar cells without any degradation in the short circuit current.   The Phase II program will aim to further optimize single-junction nanostructured InGaP solar cells and then utilize these cells as building blocks to construct robust, multijunction photovoltaic devices with power conversion efficiencies approaching 40%.  Ultimately, the technical approach employed in this program has the potential of achieving conversion efficiencies exceeding 50% with a single p-n junction device, enabling improved overall performance and lower manufacturing costs.",

        "abstract": "An Adaptive Feedforward and Feedback Control (AFFC) Framework is proposed to suppress the aircraft's structural vibrations and to increase the resilience of the flight control law, in the presence of AE/ASE interactions. Specifically, the adaptive feedforward controller is designed to reduce any atmospheric induced structural vibrations of the aircraft. The adaptive feedback controller is applied as an additive perturbation of the flight control system to suppress any undesired AE/ASE interactions, and prevent the onset of Flutter/Limit Cycle Oscillation (LCO) instabilities within the flight envelope of a flexible aircraft.\nThe proposed research effort fits very well within the scope of the NASA Dryden Flight Research Center topic \"A1.10 Adaptive Structural Mode Suppression,\" specifically within the Integrated Resilient Aircraft Control (IRAC) effort under the Aviation Safety Program. This research will help the original flight control system to robustly recover from or adjust easily to any unforeseen change during its normal operation due to AE/ASE interactions. In addition, practical concerns will deal with the minimal interference with the original rigid-body controller, as well as its feasible implementation using the standard controller's sampling rate frequency.",

        "abstract": "Small UAVs have more than proven their value in the military world and will also be utilized for homeland applications such as border security, law enforcement and situational awareness. Future micro-UAVs (MUAVs) will offer greater utility and lower cost and at the same time require reduced size, weight and power infrared cameras. Uncooled focal plane array (FPA) technology has evolved such that high performance is achieved in the long wavelength infrared (LWIR) band with small pixel pitch and fast thermal time constant. FPA temperature stabilization/cooling is not required thus reducing power and weight. On-FPA analog-to-digital conversion and custom digital electronics significantly reduces power dissipation. This small IFOV with short focal length optics, on FPA dewar, small pitch FPA sensor and custom digital electronics technology allows development of ultra-lightweight and low power infrared cameras for use on micro-UAVs. Black Forest Engineering, on Phase II, will develop and demostrate a 640x480 pixel format LWIR camera on Phase II with weight < 10 grams and power < 1.5 watt camera  integrated within MUAV structural elements.",

XPRT is proposing that RSVP techniques based on the associated RFCs and supporting compatibility among the various COTS products should be used for the edge product to be developed in this effort. This strategy will facilitate the product development, since the detailed procedures and reference software code for some of them are easily available. \u00a0MLPP based flow control and CAC will be leveraged from XPRTs Comprehensive Edge Solutions Technology (CEST).  BENEFIT: The theoretical analyses conducted during this Phase II effort can build foundations for future research and development in the area of QoS, specifically IntServ and DiffServ. For example, studying ARSVP from the angle of exploiting statistical multiplexing for BW savings while meeting QoS expectations, one can develop theoretical boundaries that can be compared to the theoretical boundaries of DiffServ based networks. This approach is in line with DARPAs vision of finding the theoretical boundaries for network protocols to bring our level of analytical understanding of networks to the same level of understanding the boundaries with a single communication channel (e.g., Shannon bound). \u00a0XPRT Solutions envisions that it can market QoS products as stand-alone HW (gateway or edge device) or as SW libraries that can reside on a third party HW with a well defined API. XPRT Solutions, through its development of the CEST product line, has a clear understanding of the value of developing SW that can be used to glue (integrate) networks from different vendors to achieve a required QoS.",

The temperature swing is achieved through cooling to well below metabolic temperatures.  The coolant can be water, liquid CO2 (LCO2), or any cryogenic fluid.  Water or LCO2 is used as coolant by expanding the liquid to below sublimation temperatures when exposed to low pressure or vacuum environments.

        "abstract": "Airbone networks are envisioned to provide seamless connectivity for terrestial and space networks and eable a large number of applications. All these applications require proper routing security support to establish correct routes between communicating platforms in a timely manner. Although the airborne network shares some similarities with conventional wired and wireless networks, the security aspects valid in these conventional networks are not fully suitable to airborne networks due to their unique characteristics such as high mobility and mission-critical applications. The central theme of this effort is to develop an Efficient and Adaptive Routing Security(EARS) solution for airborne networks. In Phase I, we present a generic version of the EARS scheme, and in Phase II we will further refine our scheme by including new security mechanisms and customizing the solution to different routing protocols. The significant advantages of the proposed approach can be summarized as follows:1) it is impervious to network dynamics; 2) it can operate autonomously without an always-on connectivity to external servers; 3) it is efficient in terms of computation and communication overheads; and 4) it can be adaptive to different routing protocols. To our best knowledge, this work represents the first effort for routing security in airborne networks.  BENEFIT: The proposed routing security solution has tremendous potential in military applications. Given the GIG vision, heterogeneous and dynamic RF networks will be common and therefore accurate and timely information delivery is necessary. The proposed algorithms and the developed simulation tool can be applied to various military networks for major programs like Tactical Targeting Network Technologies (TTNT) System, Network Common Data Link (N-CDL) system, Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program, Future Combat System (FCS), FORCENET, etc. IAI is already a contractor on the Future Combat System (FCS) program. We are teamed with Honeywell on the FCS-Platform Soldier Mission Readiness System and with Northrop Grumman on FCS-logistic decision support system. We will leverage these relationships to identify the end military customer (e.g. FCS), and work with these teams to transition our Phase II technology into the FCS and other programs. In addition, our industry partner, Raytheon and Telcordia can also transition these technologies. The market for military applications is quite large. \u00a0Potential commercial applications of our proposed routing security approach include wireless ad hoc networks (MANETs), Wireless Mesh Networks (WMN) and Wireless Vehicle Networks (WVN), where exist both the infrastructure and more mobile gedgeh networks. The size of the market is quite large and may grow rapidly with the commercial demand in network security, reliability and availability.

        "abstract": "The ability to provide positive identification and authentication of data as it is disseminated throughout a network environment remains unsolved for the vast majority of current operational deployments; however, recent advances in steganography and watermarking technology have now begun to provide approaches that address this problem. In combination with traditional encryption, hashing, and time stamping techniques, these technological advances are now able to provide the necessary framework to support proper identification and authentication of data as it traverses a network. The Global Information Grid (GIG) would benefit greatly from such a utility, as the information and applications being distributed across the network have various classification levels.  Pikewerks has spent the past six months developing a prototype digital watermarking capability that provides authentication in a net-centric environment. The prototype system allows incoming/outgoing network traffic to be authenticated and forwarded appropriately using driver and hardware components. The successful development and deployment of this data protection platform could eventually lead to a common network watermarking standard for use across the entire Department of Defense. Similarly, this standard will be of great interest to commercial organizations as they seek protection against inappropriate disclosure and dissemination of proprietary intellectual property.",

        "abstract": "The enabling solid state semiconductor technology in modern electronics and radar systems increases their vulnerability to the effects of high power, fast rise-time EMP, HPM, and UWB pulses.  In recent years, significant advances in the technology used to produce these pulses have been made in the United States and abroad, increasing the need for effective protection against these threats.  However, currently available protection devices are incapable of achieving the necessary combination of fast response time, high power handling capability, and low impact on system performance demanded by modern radar systems. To meet this need, Plasma Sciences Corporation is taking advantage of recent advances in nanotechnology to create a plasma limiter capable of both high speed and high power operation while having minimal degradation on normal system performance.  Existing plasma limiter technology utilizes metallic point-plane electrode configurations, but the advent of aligned carbon nanotube (CNT) arrays presents an opportunity to generate a breakthrough in plasma limiter performance.  Using a CNT array as a field enhancing electrode in a plasma limiter promises to offer faster reaction time, higher power handling capability, lower insertion loss, and greater reliability than existing systems, providing effective protection for radar systems against high power, fast rise-time pulses.",

        "abstract": "Next generation processors attain better performance than existing microprocessors because the abstraction layers better expose the underlying VLSI resources (transistors, wires, pins, ...) and constraints (e.g., wire delay, power, ...). However, the management of these resources and constraints requires the development of more sophisticated hardware and software mechanisms, both to improve efficiency and to ease programmer burden. MaXentric believes the largest advances in the next decade of computer architecture will center around these mechanisms. Our vision is a tool chain of software support that helps the user parallelize applications from choosing the appropriate architecture to analyzing and profiling the application for potential re-organization and improvement. We propose one piece of this chain, codenamed PAMM (Problem-Architecture Mapping for Multi-core) that helps the user select an architecture for a given application and to make optimizations based on that architecture. During Phase I, MaXentric demonstrated the feasibility of the approach. During Phase II, the technical team will build a PAMM prototype for Phase III commercialization.  BENEFIT: Moore''''s law has provided computer architects with a wealth of on chip resources. Next generation processors reflect the latest innovative responses to advances in integration technologies. However, from a programmer''''s perspective, parallelization is still a difficult task with a lack of tool chain support and a small community. Tools developed under this SBIR project will be equipped to support high performance application development projects in the commercial and defense realms. Value added to a project has two flavors. Firstly, these tools will aid in the acquisition of computing resources, allowing project managers to select hardware that best fits their applications and consequently slashing unnecessary costs. Secondly, the tools will assist the programmers in the project as they build their applications, decide how to map them to architectures, and optimize their code for higher performance. Both the defense and commercial sectors are interested in computationally intensive problems that could be accelerated by a well chosen next generation processor.",

The innovation of this work is based upon the complete removal of the GaAs substrate from the epitaxial layers while maintaining the performance of the solar cell device and the re-usage of the GaAs substrate.  Development efforts will focus on the manufacturability of the ELO process towards increasing the throughput and device yield. This effort will concentrate on the development of large scale plating which plays a critical role in the ELO process.  Initial work will be on 4-inch GaAs substrates and will be subsequently transferred to 6-inch GaAs substrates since this provides a significant increase in throughput for material growth and device processing.

        "abstract": "A nonhazardous urine pretreatment system prototype is proposed that will stabilize urine against biological growth or chemical instabilities without using hazardous chemicals.  Untreated urine fosters biological growth, ammonia off-gassing, creation of bio-solids, and inorganic precipitates, which foul water and air reclamation hardware.  The current Russian system employs hexavalent chromium, a strong oxidant and carcinogen, and sulfuric acid to stabilize urine (pH=1.8), while the future American system utilizes Oxone\u0084\u00a5, a strong oxidant, potassium hydrogen sulfate, and potassium benzoate to stabilize urine (pH=2.4).  Urine stabilized by these methods requires triple and double containment, respectively.  Chemical storage, handling, and delivery of pretreatment chemicals are also problematic due to their hazardous nature and low pH, which significantly increases Equivalent System Mass.  The proposed prototype will utilize non-oxidizing biocides in combination with nontoxic and noncorrosive solid phase urine acidification to stabilize urine at much higher pHs (3.6-5.5).  This approach has stabilized urine effectively for over 57 days during the Phase 1 program.

        "abstract": "Heat pipes are widely used for passive, two-phase electronics cooling. As advanced high power, high performance electronics in space based and terrestrial applications produce ever increasing heat fluxes, heat pipes with improved thermal capacity are sought. Illuminex Corporation has demonstrated that using copper nanowire arrays as the wick in heat pipes increases the heat transfer capabilities. Phase I developed processing techniques to engineer copper nanowire arrays on copper sheet that were subsequently incorporated into vapor chamber style heat pipes as the wicking material at the evaporator region. In Phase II, the program will be advanced to manufacture large area copper sheets fully covered with nanowires on one side. This material will be used to construct the entire heat pipe, package and wick. This will enable the development of high performance, lightweight, low-profile (< 1 mm) heat pipes with enhanced thermal transfer properties. The decrease in weight and size is desirable for NASA space projects and will find commercial application in radar systems, servers, and portable electronic devices. The use of less material in heat pipe manufacture will result in lower production costs while the superior performance and smaller size will provide electronic system designers with greater flexibility in thermal management system design.",

On the hardware front, a reliable test and measurement setup shall be constructed in order to determine instances of false alarms, assess environmental challenges, investigate leakage issues, and help to characterize the labels.

ORBITEC is proposing to continue developing high-fidelity lunar dust simulants that better match the unique properties of lunar dust than existing regolith simulants (such as JSC-1AF).  Current lunar regolith simulants do not have enough of the very fine particles, most lack the agglutinitic glass and complex surface textures that dominate lunar dust, and none of them have nanophase iron (Fe0).  High-fidelity lunar dust simulants approximate the size, morphology, composition, and other important properties of lunar dust (including nanophase Fe0).  High-fidelity lunar dust simulants are required to physically evaluate the effects of lunar dust on the operation of all Exploration Surface Systems and to verify the effectiveness of dust mitigation strategies and technologies.  During Phase 1, several prototype lunar dust simulants were created, samples of the prototype lunar dust simulants were delivered to NASA for characterization (TRL 4).  The proposed Phase 2 effort will refine and demonstrate the production process for lunar dust simulants that will be characterized and delivered to NASA for a variety of applications (TRL 6).",

The realization of this promise impinges on the availability of sensitive and selective affinity reagents for their detection.  Existing methodologies for generation of affinity reagents are cost prohibitive and labor intensive.  A niche exists for obtaining high affinity ligands to newly identified biomarker proteins merely from their primary sequence information.   In Phase I we showed proof-of-concept for a high affinity ligand generation system. The process combines an innovative datamining methodology with an automated high-throughput screening method to produce high affinity ligands to protein biomarkers.  Information in existing proteomics databases was exploited (using our automated mining software to be implemented in Phase II) to find high affinity ligand candidates.  A custom high-density peptide microarray of these candidates was created and screened using the protein to identify high-affinity ligands experimentally.  Using this methodology, it will be possible to produce very high affinity recognition agents for biomarkers very rapidly, in a matter of days, easily besting all other existing techniques.",

Unlike conventional high-speed cameras, which produce two-dimensional photographs at moments in time, a streak camera produces a photograph where time is one of the dimensions. A unique property of streak photography that makes it ideal for this application is that objects in the debris field are naturally sorted by velocity. In Phase 1, we built a breadboard scanner system using line-scan cameras operating at 20 kHz, and used this system to obtain streak photographs of debris fields with velocities up to 90 m/s. These experiments helped to establish requirements for the system such as camera line rate and field-of-view, illumination intensity and wavelength, and optimum camera configuration for stereo viewing. In Phase 2, we will build and deliver a prototype scanner system using high-speed Digital Streak Cameras that will be capable of measuring fragments with velocities up to 1000 m/s.",

Paramount to this is exploration missions capable of in-situ analysis of core samples that deliver the stratigraphy of the target. These sample handling technologies must be developed to meet a broad range of potential requirements, including a variety of rock or subsurface materials, rigorous sample preservation requirements, and the general problem of autonomous operation in the presence of dust and with limited resources. Honeybee seeks to develop critical subsystems for a small, low-mass, low-power Rotary-Percussive Corer (RoPeC) capable of autonomous sample acquisition and delivery from a depth of 5 cm. Specific attention will be given to the tall-pole items including the core break-off, retention, delivery, rotary-percussive drive, and gas flushing subsystems.

Previous coring tool development has focused on integration and far-horizon proof of concepts; resulting in complete systems designed around specific requirements. The path forward lies in maturing specific aspects of designs quickly. The Phase 1 research has resulted in a survey of existing sampling systems as well as a conceptual design of the RoPeC with a focus on modularity. In Phase 2, Honeybee will mature the design of RoPeC subsystems; including the integration of a percussive voice coil actuator developed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory for the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) Powder Acquisition Drill System.

Recent developments on polymer coatings demonstrate the potential to meet and exceed all erosion/abrasion resistance and optical requirements by using plasma deposition of Diamond-Like Carbon (DLC) films. INTER Materials is in a unique position to assist SOCOM with the development of a novel DLC surface coating concept for transparent polymers that provides to the helicopter windscreens with erosion/abrasion resistance and optical properties superior to PMMA. Our confidence in this technology is based on: 1) INTER Materials\u2019 experience with erosion/abrasion protection, ballistic tolerance, and laser protection for window/sensor on rotary wing aircrafts; 2) INTER Materials\u2019 promising and innovative multiple layers film deposition system using Plasma Ion Beam Deposition (PIBD) and Plasma Ion Immersion Deposition (PIID) processes; 3) INTER Materials\u2019 ongoing working relationships with technology leaders in PIBD and PIID for DLC coatings; and 4) INTER Materials\u2019 commitment to design and build its own 84\u201d diameter vacuum system for DLC coating of existing new and used MH-6, MH-60 and MH-47 helicopter windscreen prototypes.   BENEFITS: INTER Materials proposes to investigate a novel Diamond-Like Carbon (DLC) surface coating concept for transparent polymers including polycarbonate and PMMA by incorporating an innovative multiple layers film coating system. The multiple layers deposition will be evaluated using two plasma deposition processes separately, Plasma Ion Beam Deposition (PIBD) and Plasma Ion Immersion Deposition (PIID). The objective of multiple layers is to custom design the adhesion, hardness, and erosion/abrasion resistance properties of the DLC coated film. The approach is to explore both plasma deposition processes, PIBD and PIID, then select the process that will deliver the best DLC properties at the most competitive cost for large-curved existing new and used windscreen prototypes of the MH-6, MH-60, and MH-47 helicopters. INTER Materials anticipates that the new DLC polymer surface coating technology will have an excellent commercial potential and a reduced investment risk because it will utilize its current transparent armor manufacturing infrastructure.

A key element of our technology is the stack oriented rather than a framework driven approach which allows it to interoperate with common existing scientific visualization software thereby eliminating the need for the user to switch and learn new software.

Current state-of-art technologies can not provide all features of high energy and efficiency, compactness, narrow linewidth, super frequency and power stability, low noise, and high extinction ratio at the same time. PolarOnyx proposes, for the first time, a high energy (100 mJ) single frequency (< 1 KHz) PCF fiber laser transmitter to meet with the requirement of solicitation. This proposal is based on the spectral shaping sub-mJ fiber laser we have achieved in our labs.  In the high power amplifier stage, PolarOnyx proposes an innovative PCF fiber based regenerative amplifier approach by employing our patent pending proprietary technologies in fiber lasers, that will be able to operate at low repetition rate (10 Hz to 1 kHz) and reach high energy level of 100 mJ. These will make the fiber laser transmitter system superior in terms of wall plug efficiency (over 30%), energy(100 mJ), noise, size, and cost.  Proof of concept experiment has been demonstrated in Phase I time frame. A compact prototype will be delivered in Phase II.",

        "abstract": "This proposal describes an innovative reliability defect detection and fault propagation approach for improving integrated circuit reliability while minimizing impact on area overhead, power consumption, and electrical performance degradation over indigenous libraries. The approach is based on an innovative built in current sensor (BICS) technique designed to provide portability across process independent foundries suitable for digital, analog, and mixed signal design architectures. The BICS approach will be further characterized and validated against a standard set of metrics, including design, area overhead, performance, and power consumption, and further characterized as prototypes in silicon. Phase I included simulation and modeling of feasible designs, process variations, subthreshold leakage, radiation effects, and reliability monitor. These results provided baseline results for a Phase II research effort focusing on validating the theoretical results. A Phase II project will provide various detailed designs, layouts, and parts fabricated using a 180nm Bulk CMOS process to further validate the BICS solution set. The BICS designs will be used to determine its efficacy within a plug and play System Integrated Recovery (SIR) environment being developed by L-3/Jaycor, our collaborative partner.  BENEFIT: Results from this successful research will lead to a cost effective reliability enhanced design (RED) technique for improving reliability of present and future space electronics, especially for space computers. Furthermore, the approach is ideally suited for present, as well as future, ultra large-scale integration (ULSI) integrated circuit (IC) designs based on ultra deep submicron processes. The technique overlays seamlessly in present day IC designs as a supplemental in-circuit reliability monitor for commercial and military electronics. The BICS possesses unique attributes enabling it to become increasingly more effective as circuit densities are increased and feature sizes scaled below 90nm making it ideal for plug and play architectures in operationally responsive space applications.",

        "abstract": "Unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) will play an important role in the nation\u2019s next-generation ground forces. Control of UGVs is accomplished remotely, through a command system that allows an operator(s) to receive sensor data from the UGV and send motion commands to the vehicle. Remote control (i.e. teleoperation) of a UGV is a physically and cognitively complex task, because the operator must command the vehicle based on limited sensory information. This problem is exacerbated when an operator attempts to command a vehicle traveling at high speed. Bridging the gap between current teleoperation systems and a system that can enable robust high-speed teleoperation requires innovation in several areas, including visual sensing, auditory and tactile sensing, and embedded control algorithms. To address the above challenges, Quantum Signal has initiated development of the DRIVER system for high speed UGV teleoperation. The system will be easy to operate, and will enable safe teleoperation of UGVs at high speeds by: 1) Providing a diverse, data-rich sensory environment to the operator via a compact, man-portable interface; 2) Seamlessly embedding intelligent stability control algorithms in the operator interface; 3) Efficiently transmitting sensor feedback and driver commands over a wireless network with limited bandwidth.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:   This proposal addresses the problem with development of a system capable of creating a small size, light beacon on a distant, image-resolved target after laser beam propagation through turbulent medium. Novel solutions to this problem are required, since the conventional target-in-the-loop (TIL) adaptive optic concept is generally not effective in many practical operational environments. MetroLaser has developed an innovative approach for a TIL method for effective compensation of laser beam aberrations induced by deep turbulence. The proposed solution to the problem is based on the analogy between the concepts of a TIL system and a laser cavity. In Phase I of this program, we analyzed the performance of the proposed method and experimentally proved its capability to control the structure and spatial location of the laser beam on the target after propagating through the simulated turbulent medium. In Phase II, we will design, integrate and validate a robust brassboard that will be used for experimental demonstration of a minimal size beacon formation on a distant, extended target with scattering surface. The program will culminate with field testing of the brassboard in the environment with realistic atmospheric conditions.   BENEFIT:   The proposed solution will support numerous applications and critical technologies that require control of a laser beam profile as it propagates through optically non-uniform media. The technique can also be used to mitigate the effects associated with laser beam propagation through mediums with strong optical non-uniformity. The latter is a widespread problem typical for lasercom, underwater laser beam propagation, and perspective medical laser use, where the tissue is optically transparent although it has strong optical non-uniformity.",

Flexible antennas are highly desired in many scenarios, such as pressurized rovers, pressurized habitats, space suits, and any other applications that require conformal profiles. Existing flexible electronics has an intrinsic low switching frequency due to their low carrier mobility.  The CNT network in solution we used has carrier mobility as high as 46770cm2/V\u0095s and a large current-density carrying capacity of ~1000 mA/cm2, corresponding to a high carrying power of over 2000mW/cm2. Such high carrier mobility and large current carrying capacity allow us to achieve high-speed (>100GHz), high power flexible electronic circuits and antennas.

Development of high temperature, high efficiency heat exchangers is critical for next-generation nuclear power and space propulsion systems. In Phase I, Ultramet and Sandia National Laboratories demonstrated the feasibility of using high surface area foam core heat exchanger technology to substantially improve the power conversion efficiency of liquid metal-to-gas high temperature heat exchangers for fission surface power systems. Preliminary design and modeling suggested a substantial improvement in the efficiency of a liquid lithium-to-helium component relative to conventional plate-fin heat exchangers, and hardware fabrication and testing demonstrated the manufacturability, performance, and simplicity of the foam-based design. Open-cell foam is a natural coolant channel that does not require extensive, expensive machining of intricate coolant passages and eliminates the need for braze-bonding or welding of numerous individual sections. Initial testing showed the ability of textured, vapor-deposited lithium-compatible coatings to be uniformly wetted by liquid lithium at low temperature. The technology has the potential to best minimize the temperature difference between the maximum lithium reactor coolant and helium working fluid temperatures, as well as to reduce system mass and volume through the use of high surface area, low density open-cell foam, and increase safety and reliability by minimizing the number of piece parts and associated joints. In Phase II, Ultramet will team with Sandia to expand on the Phase I success by performing comprehensive design and stress analysis, determining physical properties, and establishing performance through high temperature (1000 K) thermal response and flow testing of coaxial heat exchangers using the Helium Flow Loop and Liquid Metal Integrated Test System at Sandia's Plasma Materials Test Facility.",

        "abstract": "Long-term Lunar and Martian systems present challenges to thermal systems, including changes in thermal load, and large changes in the thermal environment between day and night.  The innovation in the program is the development of a variable conductance heat pipe (VCHP) that passively accommodates the changing thermal load and environment.  This allows the heat pipe evaporators (and any attached heat exchanger) to remain at an almost constant temperature. In addition to passively controlling the thermal load, the non condensable gas allows the fluid in the heat pipe to freeze in a controlled manner as the heat pipe is shut down, avoiding damage.  The gas in the VCHP also helps with start-up from a frozen condition.  The overall technical objective of the Phase I and Phase II programs is to develop a VCHP radiator that can passively adjust to changing temperatures/powers in the Lunar and Martian surface environments while maintaining the coolant outlet temperature in an acceptable range.  During the Phase II program, a radiator panel and heat exchanger will be fabricated, then tested in a thermal vacuum chamber. Tests will include thermal cycling, as well as the ability of the radiator to startup from a frozen state.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The use of taggants to mark and identify objects and materials is an emerging technology with many potential applications. One very important taggant application is the ability to remotely identify appropriately tagged materials and objects from airborne platforms. Biological materials, or bio-taggants, have the potential to effectively and selectively mark targets of high interest. Intelligent Optical Systems has demonstrated the ability to enhance the detectability of bio-taggants via a two pronged approach: using specialized, biocompatible quantum dots (QDs) as taggants, and using a specialized time-correlated photon counting system designed to sensitively detect QD fluorescence excited by eye safe laser radiation.  Phase I work indicates that it is possible to detect QD labeled bio-taggants at altitudes of 100 m to 5 km. Phase II work will produce and demonstrate a field deployable prototype capable of deployment on an air platform. A partnership will be established with a military prime contractor to make the taggant detection available for procurement.  BENEFIT:  The proposed quantum dot labeled bio-taggant methodology and time correlation enhancement will result in an entirely new class of military, forensic and law enforcement tools.  Remote detection has applications in monitoring terrorist activities, illegal drug activity, and even the illegal dumping of toxic materials.  In addition, as costs come down, it may be possible to employ this technology for industrial and agricultural activities, such as wide field studies of fertilizer application effectiveness and the use of genetically modified organisms.",

The platform is designed to support a cognitive style of information processing and data fusion. The computational methods are cognitive  in the sense that they implement a logico-mathematical process that is flexible, context sensitive, and hypothesis-driven, emulating the way in which human experts assimilate and interpret arriving data, progressively transforming data into information and understanding, while gracefully adapting or revising old hypotheses as needed based on newly detected events and conditions. The platform uses information framing and multi-layer fusion to organize collected information, to group, filter, and fuse signals intelligence data, and to organize the presentation of data to users and analysts. The framing and fusion algorithms provided by this toolset will be used to support the work and enhance the effectiveness of SIGINT analysts as they assess the relationships between  detection events to discover patterns and trends, improving the accuracy and efficiency of analyst detection, identification, and geo-location of emerging threats.",

However, there is little guidance on how to build or acquire simulators with the appropriate fidelity to achieve specified training objectives, maintain trainee buy-in, and fit within budgetary constraints. Aptima developed the Predicting Requirements for instructional Environment Design to Improve Critical Training (PREDICT), a model-based tool to help professionals understand the effects and costs of their system fidelity options. In Phase II, Aptima will conduct focused experimentation to validate the algorithms that drive the PREDICT model and build a comprehensive cost model to ensure the most relevant costs are considered.

The result will be a stand-alone radar/tip timing radar module for current conventional NSMS users (as an upgrade) and new users.  The hybrid system will use frequency data and relative mode vibration levels from the radar sensor to provide substantially superior capabilities over current blade vibration technology.  This frequency data, coupled with a reduced number of tip timing probes, will result in a system capable of detecting complex blade vibrations which would confound traditional NSMS systems.  The hardware and software package will be validated on an existing compressor rig at MSI.

GFI provides many solutions with good strehl over a wide range of target area which can be selected to place and maintain the hit spot in a desired location.  The sensing technique has been extended to utilize \"intensity only\" data to allow implementation conformal to the aircraft skin.   This SBIR Phase II project will demonstrate the GFI technique in the laboratory.    This lab demo is a moderate fidelity simulation of the turbulence and sensing architecture of GFI during an LT1 (Low Tactical 1) engagement.  Hartmann sensors will be used to produce data identical to a conformal array of sensors.  The aimpoint selection and maintenance process that allow the system to keep the hit spot in the desired region of the target and maintain a good strehl ratio during the burn will be verified.  Anchoring the lab test results to the simulation model will provide a powerful tool which can be used to model the GFI architecture under many different engagement conditions to quantify its performance envelope.   BENEFIT:  GFI beam control is well suited to phasing and correcting a conformal array of HEL fiber lasers through turbulence.  Besides the air-to-air engagements, the technique also applies well to air-to-ground and ground-to-air scenarios, as well as applications such as imaging and aim point maintenance through long horizontal paths.  The speckle processing used in GFI is well suited to HEL diagnostics in that the quality of the hit spot can be measured in real-time.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  As the military continues to move forward with an increased number of sensor and resulting fusion systems, it becomes necessary for these systems to be to communicate efficiently and effectively. This is especially important to the Air Force as they address the persistent layered sensing problem. In this problem, there are a number of sensor and fusion systems that in the past have operated independent of one another in a stovepiped fashion. As the military continue to move toward a more network centric environment, the need for these existing systems to operate with legacy fusion systems as well as newly developed systems become imperative. The goal of this effort is to extend the work complete during the first phase that demonstrated the ability to develop a common representation of a surveillance region through a common tracking number approach. As part of this Phase II effort, we propose to extend this successful Phase I proof-of-concept demonstration to more complex scenarios and environments by researching and developing new algorithms and concepts to solve the distributed fusion and tracking numbering problem.  BENEFIT:  Upon successful completion of this Phase II effort, Black River Systems Company will have demonstrated a data fusion handoff capability that solves a challenging Air Force problem. This will be accomplished by maintaining consistent identification of the target during transition between fusion systems and managing the uncertainty of the tracks during periods of transition all while working with legacy fusion systems.",

Current information interfaces lack a targeted operational focus and provide a broad superset of data, which results in Ground Soldiers becoming overloaded by extraneous or non-critical information. To address this issue, the U.S. Army is developing User-Defined Operational Picture (UDOP) technology that manages incoming information to maximize Ground Soldier effectiveness. However, the Infantry Warrior Simulation (IWARS) and similar simulation-based analysis tools do not currently provide a means of modeling UDOPs and their effect on Ground Soldier performance. New modeling and simulation technologies are needed to address this gap. We propose to develop a system for Modeling UDOPs within Simulated Environments (MUSE) that (1) uses automated analysis techniques to determine what information the Ground Soldier needs to perform effectively, (2) provides tools for constructive simulation analysis that support the modeling and simulation of the information available to the simulated Ground Soldier based on the simulated UDOP\u2019s capabilities and known limits of human information processing, and (3) that can be readily transitioned to operational UDOP systems.",

Existing discrete element method (DEM) or finite element (FE) models lack adequate fidelity for fine cohesive powders comprised of friable particles with irregular shapes and exhibiting substantial bulk dilation upon initial excavation.  As such, they are inadequate for assessing the reliability of regolith excavation and handling systems, and even less so for evaluation of engineering trade-offs between total system mass, power and energy consumption.  Also, current simulation tools do not include the effects of triboelectric and photo-ionization-induced charges on regolith particles.\nBuilding on the successful Phase-1development of a new charge-patch electrostatic model and a comprehensive cohesive particle interaction model for DEM, Grainflow Dynamics proposes to develop a high-fidelity predictive calculational tool, in the form of a DEM module with calibrated interparticle-interaction relationships, coupled with a FE module utilizing enhanced, calibrated, constitutive models which, together, are capable of mimicking both large deformations and the flow behavior of regolith simulants and lunar regolith under conditions anticipated in ISRU operations. This will not only provide unparalleled fidelity but also will leverage the computational efficiency of the continuum FE codes to drastically reduce the simulation time and resources necessary to perform engineering analyses on regolith systems. In addition, the modules will be parallelized to maximize their usefulness in multi-core and cluster computing environments.

This effort will advance InP solar cell development by decreasing the weight and increasing the flexibility of the solar cell while maintaining the efficiency performance.  The innovation of this work is based upon the complete removal of the solar cell epitaxial layers from the entire InP substrate while maintaining the performance of the solar cell and the reuse of the InP substrate. The reusage of InP substrate provides for the first time a clear pathway towards the lowering of the cost of InP cells, which have been limited by the high cost of InP substrates.   BENEFIT:   The proposed Phase II work will focus on the improving the lift-off process of InP-based solar cells on 3-inch substrates and subsequently on 4-inch InP substrates. A significant cost reduction will be achieved through the unique process of epitaxial liftoff (ELO), which will allow the InP substrate to be reused. The majority of the cost of InP-based ELO solar cells will become the cost of the InP-based epitaxial materials and associated processing cost rather than the substrate. The proposed ELO technology platform therefore has the clear potential to reduce the cost of InP solar cells by a minimum of 50% in comparison to the current technology. As the ELO manufacturing process matures and the reliability of the ELO cells become proven, these solar cells can be universally applied to both space and terrestrial market.",

        "abstract": "The Lunar Sulfur Capture System (LSCS) is an innovative method to capture greater than 90 percent of sulfur gases evolved during thermal treatment of lunar soils. LSCS sorbents are based on lunar soil iron compounds that trap sulfur contained in hot in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) product gases. Small amounts of polishing sorbents are used as needed to reduce equilibrium sulfur concentrations to the ppm or sub-ppm level. The LSCS is an effective technology for protecting in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) hardware from damage caused by the corrosive effects of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and other sulfur-containing gases. Saturated sorbents can be regenerated for reuse, and desorbed sulfur can be converted to elemental sulfur. Key process steps include bulk H2S capture on lunar soil, further capture of H2S on polishing sorbent, regeneration of soil sorbent for re-use, recovery of high-purity H2S, and conversion of H2S to elemental sulfur. The LSCS reduces the risk of using Earth-based sorbents for primary sulfur capture by ensuring a ready supply of sorbent in the event of poor regeneration performance or process upset. The LSCS primary sulfur sorbent can be used as a non-regenerable sorbent if necessary without significant consequence to the ISRU process.",

The approach  obsoletes the split lines required to attach metallic flex elements and either metallic or composite spacing tubes in current solutions. Sub-critical driveshaft weights half that of incumbent technology are achievable for typical rotary wing shaft lengths. Spacing tubes are described, which comprise an integral part of the initial tooling but which remain part of the finished shaft and control natural frequencies and torsional stability. A concurrently engineered manufacturing process and design for performance is described which competes with incumbent solutions at significantly lower weight and with the probability of improved damage tolerance and fatigue life. This phase II proposal seeks to produce additional fatigue test articles to supplement the pair of shafts provided during phase I for static evelauation.  The phase II effort will also support the prime contractor test program designed to raise Technology Readiness Level to 6-7.",

Conventional Navier-Stokes and Lagrangian methods have severe limitations in effectively dealing with the complexity and length-scales involved. The proposed research focuses on zonal first principal-based methods for capturing strong rotor tip vortex formation, interactions with rotorcraft blades/body, and vortex convection in distant farfield with high resolution. In this research, an innovative wavelet-based adaptive mesh Eulerian vorticity transport model for vortical wake will be combined with an existing rotorcraft Navier-Stokes model for immersed near-body regions of the rotorcraft, using an appropriate overset technology for dynamic grid interfacing. Feasibility of this wavelet method for Eulerian vorticity transport was demonstrated in Phase I. Research efforts in Phase II will focus on strengthening the unique merits and practical applicability of the methodology. The vorticity transport model will be constructed on an adaptive Cartesian mesh infrastructure with accurate flux and velocity computation schemes to efficiently conserve vortex strength and structure. The wavelet-based multiresolution algorithm, ideally suitable for the data structures will be superimposed on the vorticity model with much increased functionality of mesh adaptation. A space-filling curve method will be utilized to enable massive parallelization for large-scale simulations and analysis of unsteady rotor wake.

Honeybee has heritage in developing mechanisms for extreme, dusty environments. Near-term applications of such a connector include the utility and electrical connections that will be used on the next-generation Lunar EVA suit being developed for NASA JSC by Oceaneering Space Systems, as well as cryogenic utility connections that will be used to pass liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen during in-situ\u00ac resource utilization (ISRU) activities.

Phase 1 breadboard testing showed 53 successful mate/de-mate cycles in the presence of JSC-1AF simulant prior to failure. In addition, this failure appears to be the result of a late addition to the mechanical configuration that can be revised for even better performance. In Phase II, Honeybee will revise the design of the dust-tolerant connector, investigate design configurations for utility connections for ISRU activities, and test a connector brassboard in a chamber capable of closely reproducing conditions on the Lunar surface. This effort will lead to the development of a dust-tolerant electrical connector with a focused application to the Constellation configuration two (Lunar EVA) suits.

An increase in bond strength for primed samples relative to unprimed control specimens was noted; the improvement in the fracture toughness of the bonds was particularly of note.\nThe Phase II effort will focus on the optimization of these primer systems and associated application and activation methods.  Water-based systems will also be developed and demonstrated.",

To address this need and in response to NASA Subtopic X6.03, International Scientific Technologies, Inc. in conjunction with the College of William and Mary, proposed in Phase I the development of hydrogen-rich monomers for high performance polymers, such as aromatic polyimides, and the incorporation of metallic nanoparticles into nanocomposite materials to achieve multifunctional properties.  The Phase II Technical Objectives include synthesis and characterization of hydrogen-rich monomers, fabrication and tailoring of high performance nanocomposite materials, acquisition of test data to determine key parameters of hydrogen-rich, multifunctional nanocomposite materials, and optimization of prototype hydrogen-rich, multifunctional materials.  The Phase I program demonstrated that hydrogen-rich monomers can be prepared and polymerized with metallic nanoparticles.  The feasibility established in Phase I will be realized in Phase II through development of polymeric nanocomposite materials consisting of hydrogen-rich monomers and metallic nanoparticles.  The nancomposite materials will have multifunctional properties, including radiation shielding against galactic cosmic radiation, neutrons and electromagnetic radiation, structural integrity for flexible and rigid structures and habitats, and electrical conductivity for electrostatic control for dust mitigation during lunar missions.",

The proposed system is completely passive with no moving parts and requires no valves to ensure its high reliability.  In order to inhibit propellant contamination prior to operation in space, a unique isolation membrane will separate propellant from the emitter.  Upon heating the isolation membrane dissolves, allowing propellant from a collocated reservoir to flow forward to the electrospray thruster without contamination.  The thruster consists of an array of self adjusting emission sites that are activated by application of an electric field that initiates emission.  The delivered thrust is modulated by varying the applied electric field. \n\nThe significant innovations of the proposed colloid thruster include: a compact, low power, modular thruster system containing no moving parts, which is capable of delivering sufficient thrust for spacecraft tip-off control and ACS applications.",

The developed wireless sensor transmitter will acquire bearing parametric data, such as temperature and vibration information, and wirelessly transmit that data to an engine PHM system.  The electrical design will be complimented by a harsh environment, miniaturized packaging approach that will be integrated with the electrical system to provide prototypes that can be tested in a bearing test rig environment. Several Phase II technology demonstration prototypes will be fabricated and fully tested.  APEI, Inc. targets the achievement of a technology readiness level (TRL) of 6 at the end of this Phase II. TRL6 will be marked by the successful demonstration of the Phase II prototypes in a rig/engine test environment.  BENEFIT:   The main objectives of an engine PHM system are: (1) prevent catastrophic failures from occurring by detecting incipient faults, (2) detecting precursor-to-failure trigger points and (3) to collect and analyze system data using realistic and verifiable prognostic models to arrive at a reliability prediction that can be accurately related to the RUL of a part, component, sub-assembly or assembly. The successful implementation of such an engine PHM system will not only significantly increase safety (due to the detection and diagnostics of incipient faults), but also allow the implementation of condition-based maintenance where engine components are replaced based on RUL, not at regular time intervals (i.e., schedule-based maintenance) greatly reducing operational cost.  Moreover, the successful implementation of this engine PHM system will allow the gathering of highly accurate real-time engine data that can be used during engine performance optimization or for the development of new engines.  The sensing and gathering of highly accurate and reliable engine data is vital for the successful development and deployment of the envisioned engine PHM systems.

This level of improvement in efficiency is significant for space-based systems where overall efficiency is of great value.

        "abstract": "Many aircraft are hardened against the effects of various forms of high power electromagnetic waves, including Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP), High Power Microwaves (HPM), High Intensity Radio Frequency (HIRF), and lightning. These aircraft typically have electrically conducting coatings on their windows, with conducting gaskets that form an electromagnetic seal with the fuselage. These gaskets wear out over time, and must be periodically replaced. We consider here methods for testing the integrity of these gaskets. Gasket integrity is normally tested by placing an RF source on the exterior of the window, and checking for leaked fields on the interior. In principle, this is a straightforward process; however, newer aircraft present some challenges. In some cases, one must remove a significant amount of molding to get access to the interior of the windscreen in the cockpit. A simpler process could save considerable time and reduce the cost of testing. To address this challenge, we propose the use of a Spiral Transmission Line (STL) to detect the presence of fields leaked into a cockpit from damaged electromagnetic gaskets. To excite the field on the exterior, one would use a stripline \u201cblanket,\u201d which is an approximate TEM transmission line.   BENEFIT:   This research will lead to a design for a windscreen shield monitor that will be far more convenient to use than currently available designs. Simplifying the process will reduce the cost, and will also reduce the time the aircraft is down for maintenance. It may also increase the frequency of testing, which will increase the reliability of the shield. This makes the aircraft less vulnerable to electromagnetic pulse, lightning, or intentional electromagnetic interference. A prototype of the shield monitor will be built during Phase II, and it will be tested on aircraft. If this research is successful, then Phase III would involve using the proposed shield monitor in existing aircraft. It would also be ready to incorporate in to future aircraft, as required. It would also lead to new tests to verify the integrity of shielded doors and windows.",

Our proposed Holographic Waveguided See-Through Display (HoWSD) will integrate highly selective waveguiding Bragg holograms into a helmet-mounted display (HMD) that will provide easy-to-access clearly visible information to astronauts during extravehicular activity (EVA). The proposed HoWSD incorporates a unique design and Luminit novel Holographic Optical Elements into a functional HMD, which enables us to meet NASA goals for a functional, unobtrusive display device that can be incorporated into NASA EVA helmets. HoWSD offers a compact, low-profile display with high brightness and contrast, which is fully see-through and high resolution. In Phase I Luminit demonstrated the feasibility of a see-through helmet-mounted display which prepared us for Phase II.  In Phase II, Luminit plans to develop a fully-functional rugged prototype HoWSD that can operate under various illumination levels and demonstrate its functionality.

        "abstract": "Chip-to-chip I/O has become a serious bottleneck, especially in communications between high-speed processors and their memory devices. Integrating a large amount of memory and a powerful processor into a single 3D-IC device could alleviate this problem. Bringing the memory on-chip with a very wide bus and very short vertical interconnects would greatly increase the speed and frequency of I/O between the processor and memory. Designing and optimizing such a device would be a large and expensive undertaking. The proposed program looks to examine the 3D solution in a limited scenario, making minimal changes to an existing memory design and an existing CPU. This will not fully exploit the huge performance benefits of 3D CPU+memory integration, but it will provide a valuable proof-of-concept for future work.   BENEFIT:   The benefit of this project will be the demostration of technology that will fundamentally change the way compute engines are designed. The provision of large fast memories that function as a direct extension of the data processing silicon has direct commercial application and indeed will enable the next major stride in data processing.",

        "abstract": "Lead-lag motions of rotor blades in helicopters require damping to stabilize them. In practice, this has necessitated the use of external hydraulic dampers which suffer from high maintenance costs. High operational (lifecycle) cost has prompted rotorcraft industry to use elastomeric lead-lag dampers that result in \"dry'' rotors. However, complex behavior of elastomers provides challenges for modeling such devices, as noted by rotorcraft airframers. Currently used analytical models oversimplify the complexity of operational environment and make radical assumptions about operating parameters that, at best, lead to excessively simplistic, and often unreal, device models. These first order linear device models require costly and time consuming experiments to construct them; moreover, they do not directly relate to either the material characteristics or the geometric configuration. In Phase-I SBIR, MTC team pursued a fundamentally radical approach wherein elastomeric dampers are derived from first-principle-based modeling rather than device model-based analyses. Our Phase-I program was tailored towards successfully demonstrating closed loop simulation, i.e. a finite element based modeling of elastomeric materials integrated into a multibody dynamics framework for rotorcraft analysis. During Phase-II, comprehensive and sophisticated material models will be implemented and streamlined into a single comprehensive analysis framework. These implementations will be fully validated against bench and flight test data of Bell M429 elastomeric dampers. These program objectives will be accomplished via collaborative tripartite partnership with Bell Helicopter and Georgia Tech.",

Oxygen at pressures up to 3000 psia is particularly desired for refilling storage tanks for lunar and in-flight applications including recharging high-pressure gas bottles for EVA/EMU, lunar rovers and surface hoppers. To address these needs, Reactive Innovations, LLC proposes to continue developing and delivering a compact high-pressure oxygen concentrator that can take low-pressure atmospheric gas and generate a separate stream of high-pressure pure oxygen. During a Phase I program, we applied our high-pressure reactor hardware to separate and compress oxygen from ambient pressure air and oxygen streams in both dry and saturated conditions. We used this information to develop a predictive performance model for the oxygen concentrator to aid in a conceptual design and to allow NASA mission planners to conduct trade studies on metrics including the generated oxygen rate per compressor mass and power requirements. For the Phase II program, we will produce operational prototype electrochemical concentrators that produce 3000 psia oxygen from ambient pressure sources of air or oxygen. These concentrators will be sized to produce 2 kg of oxygen at 3000 psia within a 24 hour time period.

        "abstract": "Compact, solid-state thermoelectric devices provide many advantages in refrigeration and power generation. These highly reliable devices have no moving parts, operate over a large range of temperatures, do not emit toxic/environmentally unfriendly gases and are easily integrated into thermal systems. Despite these advantages, engineering applications have been limited by the relatively low intrinsic energy conversion efficiency of the devices compared to conventional refrigeration systems. This limitation stems from the semiconductor materials comprising the thermoelectric elements (i.e. short legs of active material between the two ceramic faces). To a lesser extent, the engineered dimensions and the thermal/electrical contact resistances of the device play a role in the overall device efficiency. Increasing the intrinsic efficiency of the thermoelectric materials and providing structures that are amenable to custom engineered geometries will open up new opportunities in Army applications such as detector cooling, integrated textile (personal BDU) cooling and conformability to waste heat pipes/machinery for energy recovery.  The results of the Phase I program provided a conceptual illustration of the method for fabricating consolidated nanophase high ZT composites and scaling the fabrication of the consolidated high ZT thermoelectric element arrays into a manufacturing setting. For the Phase II program, Nanohmics and Dr. Stokes will continue the development of FlexTEC high-ZTape, a conformable solid-state cooling device that promises high-efficiency, low-cost, and lightweight integration into Army thermal management systems.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Directed Energy Solutions (DES) is proposing to develop a cryogenically cooled diode laser stack system.  In the proposed effort DES will design, fabricate, test and delivery a cryogenically cooled multiple diode laser stack system.  Output powers of the laser system of 6 kW are anticipated with a scaling option at the 12 kW level.  At the end of proposed effort the system will be delivered to AFRL/RDLS for testing and evaluation.   The proposed effort will leverage past and present DES programs on high power solid-state laser and cryogenic laser systems.  BENEFIT:  There are several key technologies that will be developed during the proposed multiple phase program which possess significant commercialization opportunities.  These technologies are: \u2022 Cryogenic Solid-State Lasers  \u2022 Narrow Linewidth Diode Laser Bars  \u2022 Widely Tunable Diode Laser Devices (smaller market, not discussed below)  DES is developing multiple products based on the key technologies and upon completion of these devices will seek VC funding to bring these devices to market.  Incubic is one venture fund that DES has experience with and would contact about possible product funding.  Each of these technologies commercialization potential will be discussed below. Cryogenic Solid-State Lasers: The developed diode pump technology can be applied to virtually any solid-state material which results in a variety of emission wavelengths.  For instance, high power devices can be demonstrated in Yb (~1030 nm), Nd (~1060 nm), Er (~1600 nm, and 2940 nm), Tm (~2100 nm) and Ho (~2000 nm).  These efficient, compact, high power laser devices with excellent beam quality are in great demand as can be seen by the variety of industrial, academic and military based applications. \u2022 Asset protection \u2013 A high average power eye-safe laser would allow for the protection of US assets against rockets, artillery, and mortars with a significantly reduced risk of collateral eye damage.  The compact and self-contained design of a 100 kW device would allow for a variety of tactical platforms to be used such as UAV, and ground based vehicles.   \u2022 LIDAR/LADAR \u2013 High average power LIDAR/LADAR systems can be made using Er, Tm, and Ho as possible hosts.  In the case of the relatively long excited state lifetime of Er:YAG (10 ms) laser systems with repetition rates of 100 Hz can be made.  This enables a multi joule per pulse laser system with a moderate power master oscillator.  This high energy, coupled with near diffraction limited beam quality is ideal for high resolution LIDAR/LADAR at a distance.  This device would have industrial, academic and military based customers \u2022 Pump Lasers \u2013 Frequency doubling of a cryogenic Yb:YAG would allow for efficiency high energy pumping of Ti:Sapphire.  The variable pulse repetition frequency and pulse length make this type of laser source ideal for pump an fs Ti:Sapphire amplifier.  In addition high power OPOs can be made with these efficient pump sources \u2022 Spectrally diverse lasers - The cryogenic solid-state laser is an ideal pump source for high energy Raman lasers.  These lasers can be operated continuous wave or pulsed.  The variety of Raman active materials would enable nearly complete spectral coverage from the visible to the mid-wave infrared. DES is developing a 30 W cryogenic Yb:YAG laser which can be operated continuous wave and pulsed.  Upon completion of this device, DES will seek out VC funding to produce the product targeting the aforementioned markets.  Incubic is one venture fund that DES would contact about possible product funding. Narrow Linewidth Diode Laser Bars The development proposed in this multi phase effort can also be applied to narrow linewidth diode laser bars and stacks.  Narrow linewidth diode laser bars has clear commercialization potential for optical pump sources for solid-state lasers such as Er:YAG and Yb:YAG (970 nm line).  In addition, Alkali metal lasers may also require narrow linewidth pump lasers for efficient operation.  DES has extensive experience in the production of optical singlet delta oxygen (SDO) using linewidth narrowed diode laser bars.  This SDO technology kills bacteria and viruses and oxidizes VOCs and other chemical agents by using only air (oxygen) and light (from diodes).  Therefore, it represents a unique capability for sterilization, decontamination, pollution mitigation, and air quality improvement applications in hospitals, homes, commercial buildings, manufacturing and power generation plants, and government installations and vehicles.  Its effectiveness in killing cells is steeped in 20 years of research associated with Photodynamic Therapy where SDO is used to kill tumorous tissue in a light activated cancer treatment.  Its usefulness in oxidizing chemicals to safe products is well established.  What has been lacking is an effective way to make SDO in the air in large quantities. DES has overcome this last obstacle to commercialization.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  This Phase II SBIR proposal presents Spire\u2019s plan to build, test, and deliver ultra-high power, cryogenically cooled diode laser array modules designed to optically pump the AFRL cryogenic Yb:YAG thin disk laser.  Spire-designed epitaxial wafers will be grown and fabricated into diode laser bars for optimal 940 nm output power at liquid nitrogen temperature operation.  These bars will be incorporated into >2 kW CW sub-modules, to be then combined into >6 kW optical pump modules for the existing AFRL disk laser.  Spire will also produce additional 940 nm cryogenic diode laser array modules from purchased diode laser bars to obtain comparative performance data.  Spire\u2019s cryogenic diode laser arrays will be based on relatively low-cost CEO impingement coolers, which were successfully demonstrated during Phase I on a complementary MDA-funded program.  The >2 kW diode laser pump arrays will consist of twenty-two bars fitted with cylindrical lens arrays to produce collimated laser beams for uniform disk illumination.  Both copper and diamond heat spreaders directly under each laser bar will be investigated and compared for high power operation.  Spire will work closely with AFRL personnel for delivery and use of several diode laser array pump modules.  BENEFIT:  The performance of commercially-available high-power solid state lasers such as the Nd:YAG and Yb:YAG has reached upper limits of output power in the low-kW range.  At these power levels, the thermal conductivity of the solid-state lasers is not high enough to dissipate the thermal loading resulting from the optical pumps, and detrimental effects such as thermal lensing, thermal stress, and overheating prevent further significant increases in optical output power.  By operating such solid-state lasers at liquid nitrogen (LN) temperatures, these detrimental thermal effects are greatly reduced because of the large improvement in thermal conductivity of almost all materials at or near LN temperatures.  Diode laser arrays used to optically pump these solid-state lasers are also expected to benefit from such cryogenic cooling for the same reasons and, are expected to have significantly better reliability and optical efficiency.  For example, the Phase I work at Spire demonstrated that a 60 W room temperature (RT) diode laser bar emits 150 W at LN temperatures.  The combined benefits of LN operation of both the solid-state laser materials and diode laser pump array materials are expected to result in improved high power solid-state laser performance, making reproducible multi-kW output power levels a commercial reality.  Commercial applications of such high power solid-state lasers include metal welding, soldering, cutting, precision shaping and annealing for automotive, aircraft, ship-building, and industrial heavy construction.  Higher laser power levels are expected to result in increased manufacturing speed as well as improved laser performance and reliability, resulting in reduced operating cost.",

The system uses a two color Quantum Well Infrared Photo detector (QWIP) to improve the accuracy of energy release from wildfires, thereby improving our understanding of the carbon cycle. \n\nThe system includes a multi-sensor step-stare imager, position and attitude sensor, data communications link, and a data processing system with; feature extraction (such as fire detection), image geo-coding, and image compression.  \n\nThe sensor head is an innovative design combining high resolution framing devices (cameras) with a step-stare scanning mirror.  This configuration results in high spatial resolution imagery and wide area coverage.  The design of the sensor head is flexible allowing for a variety of imagers including; visible and IR cameras and/or hyperspectral sensors.

        "abstract": "Any manned missions to extraterrestrial locations will require shelter structures for a variety of purposes ranging from habitat usage to biomass production.  Such shelters need to be constructed in such a way to minimize stowed volume and payload weight.  The structures must also be very durable and have the ability to survive punctures without collapsing.  Ways of increasing available crew-load volume without greatly increasing launch weight or volume are also sought.\nInflatable structures are ideal candidates for habitat structures for several reasons: (1) they feature the low stowage volume and payload weight required, (2) deployed volume can be easily increased without large increases in launch weight or volume, (3) they offer unique opportunities for incorporating intelligent and/or multifunctional systems such as self-healing capability, power generation and storage, sensor systems, and radiation protection.\nAdherent Technologies, Inc. is proposing an inflatable, rigidizable shelter system based on our Rigidization on CommandTM (ROC) technology.  The proposed shelter system features not only the required low stowage volume and lightweight character, but also feature a self-healing foam system incorporated into the final structure to minimize the damage caused by any potential punctures to the structure.  The Phase I program successfully demonstrated the self-healing foam concept.  This system will be optimized in Phase II and incorporated into a fully functional subscale prototype habitat utilizing ROC composite outer layers, self-healing layers, thermal and micrometeoroid protective layers, integrated lighting, and power systems.",

        "abstract": "This proposal addresses the space optic community\u2019s need for an optical bonding material that demonstrates superior stability in the harsh space environment. Adhesives used in space must exhibit near-zero degassing, tolerate drastic temperature changes and be hardened to ionizing sources of radiation. The tolerance for these properties are restricted even further when applied to adhesives in the optical path, as is the case for solar cell coverglass adhesives. As the power systems have become more advanced, the limits of Dow Corning\u2019s DC93-500 have been exceeded. Infoscitex proposes to further develop a space grade optical bonding technique comprised primarily of a radiation-hardened silicate-like network combined with elastomeric linkages. During Phase I, Infoscitex demonstrated that the proposed silicate-elastomer hybrid bond (SEHB) exhibited the following advantages over DC93-500: Enhanced resistance to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, optical transmittance and clarity and thermal stability.  Infoscitex is uniquely positioned to insert candidate bonded samples into ongoing radiation resistant coverglass development testing. Phase II prototype coverglass interconnected cells (CICs) fabricated with the SEHB technology will be delivered to AFRL or platform manufacturers for prequalification. Infoscitex has teamed with an optical products supplier and a solar array manufacturer to commercialize the SEHB technology after the SBIR Phase II.  BENEFIT:   The proposed optical bond technology demonstrated superior UV resistance and transmittance compared to organic polymer adhesives and DC93-500. Initially, Product development and commercialization will be focused on DoD satellite criteria for solar cell coverglass bonding then will expand into non-DoD markets such as communications satellites and other space based optical path bonding applications.",

A unique property of the proposed instrument is that it requires little or no calibration. The Phase II project entails construction a field-ready prototype and deploying the sensor on various field missions undertaken by Aerodyne's particle measurement research group.  Aerosol particles affect the radiative balance of the earth directly, by scattering and absorbing solar and terrestrial radiation, and indirectly, by acting as cloud condensation nuclei.

The derived performance model was then be used to determine the aircraft flight envelope, performance parameters and the maneuver limits. The estimated data can be used as the basis for designing safe landing guidance laws for damaged aircraft.\n   Phase II research will refine the algorithms developed during the Phase I research and create a standalone software implementation.

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase II program will develop a space solar cell adhesive that will lose less than 3% transmittance from 400 nm to 2000 nm after 15 years in geosynchronous or medium earth orbit.  In order to achieve this, transmission, adhesion, and proton-, electron- and UV-resistance must all be improved.  The current standard,  DC-93500, is vulnerable to proton attack, but Oxazogen\u2019s adhesives are based upon novel patented hyperbranched POSS elastomers where phenyl content can be precisely controlled to achieve optimum proton resistance, while Ce(IV) isopropoxide levels can be controlled to achieve optimum UV resistance.  As well as being used to bond cover glasses to solar cells, these materials also have the ultimate potential to replace the cover glasses altogether, resulting in lower weight cells, more densely packed cell arrays, reduced arcing and significant cost savings.  Oxazogen\u2019s commercial partner, EMCORE Photovoltaics, Inc., holds 50% of the global market share in space solar cells.  During Phase I, Oxazogen developed formulations with excellent transmittance and adhesive performance, and EMCORE performed radiation-resistance testing.  During Phase II, adhesive and coating formulations will be optimized, and used to fabricate and to test the performance of prototype EMCORE space solar cells with and without cover glasses.    BENEFIT:   The adhesives and coatings developed in this Phase II SBIR will generate revenues through materials sales and patent licensing.  With the increasing effort on space applications by the military and increasing emphasis by NASA on space exploration the market for solar adhesives will continue to assume ever increasing importance and the growth is expected to accelerate in the years to come.  The market is driven by an ever-increasing demand for lower weight, higher efficiency across a wider range of wavelengths, and better durability and end-of-life (EOL) performance.  This technology has dual-use in military satellites, and in civilian communication, television broadcasting, weather forecasting and global position systems (GPS) satellites in medium earth or geosynchronous orbits.  It also has the potential to protect terrestrial electrical components (e.g., power supplies, relays, cable connectors) and electronics (e.g., assemblies and circuit boards) from temperature extremes, high humidity, thermal shock and radiation.",

        "abstract": "The proposed PII capitalizes on the positive PI results that established the feasibility of a modular, common, integral, shell/structure interface for segmented, tensionless, reflective RF apertures.  The resulting common-interface mounting system concept has been intentionally designed so that Mevicon\u2019s Membrane Aperture Shells can be mounted on a wide range of potential current and future support-structure architectures.  Activity will focus on the critical path interface items of innovative shell mounting, roll-stowage compliance mechanisms, launch-constraint methods that are critical to realizing the promise of the very low areal density (70 to 180 g/m2), compact roll-stowage, and self-deployment that are key features of Mevicon\u2019s RF proven Membrane Aperture Shell Technology.  Development work is focused on the ORS Common Aperture requirements, but the resulting technology will be applicable to a broader range of aperture applications and structure approaches.  Building on PI successes, we will, together with our PII industry transition teammates, continue to advance shell/structure interface solutions, perform detailed design and component studies, develop demonstrators and \u201creadiness for flight\u201d testbeds, and develop a flight design, thereby improving TRL levels.  This will prepare the way for a space flight demonstration, which is a key step in any realistic commercialization plan for space hardware.  BENEFIT:   The potential pay-off of the proposed research can be summarized at the highest level as \u201cLess Mass, More Responsive,\u201d reflective, doubly-curved RF apertures.  The proposed technology is a cross cutting one and is directly applicable to the needs of the ORS for a Common RF Aperture Solution, as well as to many of the AF technical areas (RS, SSA, CCC, DCS, ISR) as the reflective apertures can be used for host satellite functions (typically RF communication), as well as on the payload side (signal or image collection).  The basic advantage is that both more-affordable apertures for the same size and larger apertures for the same mass have positive cascading impacts throughout the satellite design, enabling either on launch vehicle more mission from a given bus or the use of smaller bus components.  While the end goal is to development a segmented RF reflector aperture approach capable of meeting the ORS Common Aperture requirements, this Phase II is focused on developing an innovative, modular, segment/structure interface solution for dual-roll-stowed shells that can support a range of support structure concepts.  This maximizes the commercialization transition path opportunities.  Once developed and flight demonstrated, this will open additional opportunities for government satellite applications, as well as commercial space applications, particularly in the areas of space-based RF communications and space science.  There are possible applications as solar concentrators for potential use in solar dynamic power generation and future space orbital propulsion (solar thermal propulsion).  Terrestrially, applications are foreseen in transportable emergency apertures for commercial telecom, back-packable solar concentrators for water heating, cooking, and distillation.",

This work aims to address the DoS attack from a system aspect and design an integrated scheme by adopting three commonly used defense strategies in our daily life as well as warfare. Accordingly we propose three DoS mitigation strategies and organize them into a pipeline structure, namely, DoS prevention, DoS detection and DoS response. Two specific wireless standards are considered, IEEE802.11 and IEEE802.15.4.

Current state-of-the art space mirrors do not satisfy the ULHCMs (Ultra-Lightweight Hybrid/Composite Mirrors) concepts that require 1 to 5 kg/m2 of areal density. An innovative new mirror fabrication approach is needed to address these current technical obstacles. UES successfully demonstrated the technical feasibility of hybrid mirror replication through the proposed novel fabrication processes during the Phase I period. Hybrid mirrors, with sizes up to 4-inches in diameter and an areal density below 5 kg/m2, were integrated by combining metal mirror facesheets and ultra-light inorganic sub-structures, along with an inorganic adhesive.  In the Phase II program, we will continue to refine and tune the processing variables for producing the needed properties, and will develop a robust hybridization process.  This process will be utilized during the Phase III program to fabricate a large-sized mirror (> 20 inches) that is ultra-light (an areal density < 3 kg/m2), mechanically and chemically stable, and that shows an outstanding optical quality as well as a high optical stability.  BENEFIT:   The successful completion of the Phase II program will demonstrate a novel hybridized mirror replication technology that can produce cost-effective, ultra-light, and space quality mirrors.

        "abstract": "The ongoing drive to increase the performance and efficiency of propulsion systems has led to increasingly severe operating environments, particularly for the components in the hot sections of turbine engines. One potential life-limiting area of future engines is the turbine disk where significant dwell fatigue may occur if engine temperatures are elevated. The mechanism for this reduction is not fully clear but is related to effects of grain boundary creep and surface oxidation / corrosion. The study proposed here will seek to develop advanced surface chemistry and modification techniques for the nickel-base superalloys used for turbine disks to limit dwell fatigue damage and promote higher operating temperatures in the engine.  Key factors that will be studied include: (i) computational approaches to designing novel coating compositions that exhibit minimal interdiffusion and hence excellent compatibility with the substrate owing to chemical activity matching; (ii) the manufacture and testing of selected compositions; and (iii) the application of good performing coatings onto selected regions of a turbine disk. A targeted significant outcome of this study is the establishment of novel and cost-effective surface modifications that confer greatly improved component reliability and durability.   BENEFIT:   This research is anticipated to result in technology that enables higher use temperatures for turbine disk components resulting in improved capability and efficiency for next generation propulsion systems of interest to future turbine, rocket, ramjet and scamjet engines. Specifically, the advanced environmental compositions and application approaches developed in this work will improve the resistance to creep fatigue of high strength superalloys. This will lead to the realization of many advanced gas turbine engine designs while leading to several percent thrust improvement or specific fuel consumption reduction for current turbine engines. These new capabilities will permit improved engine designs and operating levels on a range of Air Force platforms.",

        "abstract": "Protein biomarkers are finding increasing application in Force Health Protection and health surveillance. However, very few biomarkers have been verified and validated to-date. This deficiency can primarily be ascribed to the scarcity of reagents (affinity probes). There is a need for assays to measure biomarker candidates, which must be accompanied by the development of reagents for detection. Currently, no miniaturized system to develop reagents in a cost-effective, high-throughput format is commercially available. The goal of the proposed research is to develop a microfluidics-based high-throughput reagent generation platform using capillary electrophoresis (CE) to enable the discovery and directed evolution of molecular probes from combinatorial libraries using an in vitro protein selection technique. The platform will be adapted to develop immunoassays using the probes selected. Key benefits include faster screening, reduced reagent consumption (cost savings), thermostable probes, and automation.  In Phase I, we successfully demonstrated the generation of high quality combinatorial probe libraries using innovative protein engineering strategies. Proof-of-principle of the microfluidic screening concept was also established. In Phase II, the microfluidic system will be refined and used to develop reagents for selected biomarker targets, including those of interest to USACEHR. A multidisciplinary team with proven expertise in microfluidics, protein engineering, and device development has been assembled.",

This approach has been shown to provide high fill factor and low light imaging, as well as to hold promise for improving the survivability of the image sensor under intense light conditions.  We have made preliminary exploration of methods of improving the survivability of the sensors even further, by thickening the coating and making circuit and structural changes to the underlying ROIC.  We propose to explore the effects that these coating, circuit, and structural changes have on the optical response of the sensor (light gathering efficiency and resolution, in particular) and to the survivability of the sensor under high light conditions.  BENEFIT:   An optically ruggedized sensor has a number of commercial and military applications, especially when the core sensor design is scalable to provide cameras ranging from 2MP to significantly larger variants (>100MP).  The most immediate market for such sensor is the U.S. government, namely for military systems.

Phase I results show that this combination yields extremely low areal density reflective mirror surfaces and boundary support structures, leading to significant reduction of downstream system performance requirements and hence cost for space and eventually terrestrial reflective optical systems of interest to the AF and DoD.  In the PII we propose to continue to demonstrate the combination of the four areas, continue to refine membrane reflector production global figure authority and quantify readiness for flight and performance trends.  This prepares the way for potential PIII transition opportunities.  BENEFIT:   The proposed innovation has strong promise to yield an extremely cost efficient, and extremely low areal density optical reflector technology.  As such it would find direct applications in a range of space based optical systems in application areas of interest for the AF, DoD, and other Government organizations in the area of earth and deep space situational awareness/observation, space weather monitoring, space science and astronomy.  The same basic lightweight aperture technology could also be directly applied to a range of coherent and incoherent LIDAR and LADAR applications as well as optical elements of LaserComm terminals.  With additional research into promising coating techniques, directed energy applications are foreseen as well.  While the delta in terms of areal density advantage are greatest at optical wavelengths, multiple additional application areas exist for longer wavelength applications in the Near and Far IR, THz, microwave, and RF wavebands.  There are also potential applications as solar concentrators for use in power generation (either solar dynamic or concentrated Photovoltaic) and future space orbital propulsion (solar thermal propulsion or solar sails) applications.   Optically powered fast steering mirrors/chopper and eventually low order adaptive optics actuators (i.e. deformable mirrors or even active primaries) are also envisioned.  Terrestrially, the biggest return on development is expected in the area of optical apertures for prosumer amateur astronomy, university level 1-2 m telescopes, and as secondaries for professional astronomy telescopes.  As fabrication costs come down, applications are anticipated in transportable backcountry emergency apertures for commercial telecom, back-packable solar concentrators for water heating, distillation and cooking.

Such a novel use of current sharing in a balanced amplifier topology, along with a metamorphic HEMT (mHEMT) technology results in the smallest and best performance for this design.

Further reduction in size for the amplifiers is demonstrated with the use of lumped elements and lumped element hybrids in the place of distributed elements.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Helical magnetic flux compression generators have been used for five decades to amplify electrical energy and current from high explosives. Although they can now be modeled quite accurately, there are practical limitations, based on internal electrical breakdown, that limit both their compactness and ability to operate at high output voltages. The Care\u2019n LLC proposes to overcome this limitation through careful application of 3D electrostatic and inductive electric field calculations based on magnetic and electric vector potentials. Furthermore, we will assess the heretofore unaddressed issue of MHD field generation due to the motion of insulating gas through the magnetic field. The results of these studies will be incorporated into the FCG modeling code, CAGEN, which already accurately calculates the performance of helical FCGs, without any empirical factors, in the absence of electrical breakdown. The code will then be used to explore optimization strategies that take into account, explicitly, electrical breakdown thresholds.  BENEFIT:  We believe that the result of completion of the Phase II R&D effort will be a robust and validated explosive flux compression generator modeling code that both calculates expected performance with unprecedented accuracy, and furthermore provides design information about electric fields within devices. These fields are the present limitation for miniaturizing generators. With this new design tool, researchers will be able to design new explosive generators for a wide variety of military and commercial applications. Heretofore, unless new generators were small excursions from proven existing designs, long experimental development were required to establish performance limitations and achieve desired specifications. Such a development path is not only costly in terms of development time, but experiments \u2013 being only single-shot \u2013 tend to be very costly. Our new design tool will allow considerable savings in development time and cost. We expect that during a Phase III, the CAGEN code will go through considerable refinement in terms of user friendliness and the rigorous testing associated with commercial software development. The Care'n LLC is planning two commercialization pathways. The first is the incorporation of the results of this project into the HFCG modeling code CAGEN. The second is the possibility that the oil servicing companies would find very small, highly efficient HFCG advantageous to their oil stimulation services.",

        "abstract": "The project objective is to implement, validate, and optimize an integrated computer software module suite for calculating molecular adiabatic electronic energies and quantum chemical wave functions using spectral theory methods. To this end, a computational kernel is scripted for high-performance calculations of the electronic structures of chemicals & materials made from H, B, C, N, O, and F atoms. The computational kernel comprises four integrated component modules which perform the following series of individual calculations:(i) phase-consistent degenerate atomic eigenstates employing large-scale configuration-interaction methods in both real Cartesian-Gaussian and Slater-orbital representations;(ii) diatomic wave functions and Hamiltonian \\& metric matrices constructed in the antisymmetrized outer-product representation of phase-consistent atomic eigenstates; (iii) aggregate molecular metric matrices in the ordered atomic spectral-product representation required for enforcing overall electron antisymmetry; and (iv)aggregate molecular spectral-product Hamiltonian matrices assembled from the atomic, diatomic, and metric information, employing Wigner rotation matrices for all angular atomic coordinate dependencies. Representative electronic structure calculations are performed of H, B, C, N, O, and F atom-containing compounds employing Lanczos diagonalization methods and on-the-fly evaluations of molecular Hamiltonian matrix elements. The computational kernel software, documentation of the module suite operation, and a report of benchmarking results constitute the deliverable items from the project.  BENEFIT:   The computational kernel devised provides the basis for construction and operation of a diverse selection of applications software modules designed for specific chemical purposes, including but not limited to determinations of structural extremal-energy configurations, associated minimum energy paths connecting such points, molecular electronic expectation values, including charge and spin densities, dipole and transition moments, and vibrational force constants, to mention some representative examples, on-the-fly classical and quantum Monte-Carlo simulations of molecules, clusters, and condensed matter, and the free-energies of molecular association when integrated into appropriate statistical-mechanical code suites. Target problems addressed by such applications software modules based on the computational kernel include the rational design and synthesis of new chemicals and materials, fabrication of nanoscale electronic and optical devices, and development of physiologically relevant macromolecular structures in the presence of solvent for small-molecule drug design and pharmacological purposes.  A potentially significant commercial market for this technology, to be developed under Phase III continuation projects, is provided by Air Force and other DOD, DOE and NASA technical needs; the requirements of new compound development in the chemical industry; and the large NIH related high-technology biomedical and pharmaceutical research communities focused on development of therapeutic drugs and in vivo nanoscale bioimaging devices.",

Turbo-Brayton cryocoolers are an ideal candidate for these payloads.  The technology is reliable and space proven with one unit having provided over 6 years of successful operations on the Hubble Space Telescope without any change in performance.  Recent advances in component technologies have dramatically reduced the mass and increased the efficiency of turbo-Brayton cryocoolers.  Current turbo-Brayton cryocoolers are comparable in mass and efficiency with competing cryocooler technologies at modest loads and higher, and they have the inherent integration benefits of negligible vibration emittance and the ability to cool distributed loads and loads distant from the heat rejection site with minimal performance penalties.  The net result of these benefits is significant reductions in overall payload mass.  During this program, we will develop a turbo-Brayton cryocooler for a specific DoD mission.  BENEFIT:   The result of this program will be a reliable, efficient, and lightweight cryocooler for space missions.  The cryocooler addresses the near-term needs for the Space Tracking and Surveillance System and the Third Generation Infrared Surveillance programs and will be applicable to future space-based surveillance and missile-defense systems.

        "abstract": "The US military must provide the right information to its warfighters in a timely manner.  This must be done securely, to a large variety of mobile devices across different networks, in different formats, and using multiple protocols. Mobile devices should be used to receive information from the network, gather data, and send it to the network. The commercial products for these purposes do not meet many military requirements, such as security and Net-Centricity. The military has a major problem in connecting legacy systems, and adding new, proprietary commercial systems would only exacerbate the problem. We propose a system to manage information from and to a wide variety of mobile devices across networks called a Secure Information Mobile System (SIMS) that will integrate with the military Net-Centric approach. It is a standards-based, extensible, secure and unified approach to coordinate multiple devices over multiple networks, while minimizing information overload. SIMS utilizes commercial products and standards, including Semantic Web technologies, and both new and legacy military communications systems, including airborne networks, UAVs and space assets. It will both forward and gather information to and from a variety of devices, accept new devices and software readily, and be domain independent.  BENEFIT:   This system is designed to deliver and receive information from a wide variety of devices, integrate legacy, military and commercial mobile information systems, in order to provide the warfighter with the right information at the right time.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project addresses the need for compact and efficient detectors in the terahertz spectrum. Terahertz radiation is capable of penetrating fog and moderate density objects such as composites, wood and fabric at substantially higher resolutions and shorter ranges than radar. Although broadband THz detection has been reported in numerous literature accounts, there still is no cost effective and compact high resolution THz detection technology that operates at room temperature. Such features are keys to rapid and wide deployment of the technology. Pyroelectric thermal detectors are excellent candidates for broadband THz detection. The proposed technology employs novel materials processes to realize room temperature pyroelectric THz detector devices that are at least one hundred times more sensitive than commercially available devices. The technology is highly amenable to monolithic linear and two dimensional arrays for spectroscopic and imaging applications. In Phase II, SRICO would expand on the success of Phase I to achieve room temperature pyroelectric detectors with sensitivity approaching 100x the current commercially available devices. By application of suitable absorbers, the new thin film detectors will be operable over the entire terahertz spectrum of 100 GHz to 30 THz.   BENEFIT:   Applications of the new device technology include non destructive evaluation and inspection of aerospace materials and structures, imaging, spectroscopy and surveillance. Using spectroscopic techniques, THz radiation can be used for stand-off detection and imaging of aircraft structures, suspicious materials and chemicals. Deployment of these newly developed detector devices would result in successful implementation of a large number of important defense, industrial, medical, and environmental applications. Pyroelectric detectors may also be used as a transfer standard in the calibration of other terahertz detectors.",

Despite the tremendous improvements in coating technologies to enable huge increases in operational temperatures, continued advances using conventional, purely materials-science approaches have resulted in diminishing marginal returns in the last 25 years. The problem is that the turbine blades heat up as a result of radiative and conductive heat transport. Using MEMS-fabrication methods, we will develop a technique to coat the blades with Bragg reflectors, tailored to the spectrum of the radiation, that will decrease the thermal radiation from the surface to the turbine blades tenfold, thereby providing the means to (1) increase turbine-blade lifetime; and (2) attain considerably higher operating efficiencies by operating the engines at significantly higher temperatures. In our baseline Phase II program we will (1) demonstrate an optimal system\u2014fabricated utilizing MEMS technology\u2014that is designed to minimize radiative heat transport; and (2) demonstrate low-thermal-conductivity TBCs that reduce conductive heat transport. In addition, should our Phase II optional tasks be funded we will develop smart erosion sensors and microstructure with decreased thermal conductivity.",

        "abstract": "Aerius Photonics is proposing a highly practical and effective plan to develop a scene projector that allows the polarization state of each pixel to be independently and dynamically controlled at full frame rates.  The projector would utilize a single unpolarized resistor array system with a 4 polarization state linear micro-patterned polarizer.  The resultant scene projector will be capable of projecting the three linear Stokes vectors to represent any arbitrary linear polarization by adjusting the output from each pixel in each resistor array independently.  The benefits of this approach include the following: (1) reduced risk, (2) precise polarization control for each pixel, (3) compatibility with the cryogenic vacuum operation, (4) and the ability to generate the full linear Stokes vectors for compatibility with future polarization sensitive imaging sensors.   BENEFIT:   This system will quickly allow laboratories to test their imaging systems for polarization with a simple change to their current-generation scene projector systems.  Since many of the newer seekers and seeker development programs are utilizing polarization as a means for discrimination, Aerius\u2019 system will allow testing of the units without adding a substantial amount of new hardware.  Aerius expects that this product would provide a seamless migration from unpolarized scenes to polarized scenes.

A warfighter will require timely and accurate updates on changes in his/her local environment.

In order to be able to describe features and the changing environment, a principled model that can capture spatial and temporal dependencies is needed. A model, while interesting in its own right, requires ancillary development in order to be useful; thus, a spatio-temporal query language is needed. Additionally, information that is stored according to the spatio-temporal data model (STDM) and is accessed through the spatio-temporal query language must be expressed in terms compliant with relevant standards and integrated into an architecture that is relevant to both GIS and the net-centric service oriented environment.

With the possible exception of the FMG, these generators probably cannot be built to survive the high G-force environments of munitions.  Shock Wave Generators (SWGs) are very similar to flux compression generators, with the exception that magnetic field compression occurs within a material such as aluminum powder, with its insulation oxide coating, or other suitable dielectric or semiconductor that becomes conducting under the influence of a strong shock. FCGs function with a void in the inductive volume, usually filled with air or a specific gas such as sulfur hexafluoride.  Thus, a conventional FCG usually has a coaxial aluminum tube, armature, which is filled with explosive within the outer housing or stator.  This, configuration is intrinsically very difficult or impossible to harden to high G loads, >10,000 Gs.

During Phase I research MDC used piezoelectric actuator/sensor pairs to perform Lamb wave testing on composite plates with drilled holes, delamination and impact damage.  Subsequently pattern recognition methods were used to classify the presence, type and severity of damage.  This method proved very successful, demonstrating 100% accuracy in determining damage presence and type, and 99.9% for rough damage severity across 9000 tests.

The tool will be incorporated both as a plug-in component for the Geospatial Analysis and Planning Support (GAPS) Toolbox and as a Web Service application compatible with the Commercial Joint Mapping Toolkit (CJMTK) environment.  During our Phase I effort, we developed and tested an iterative approach for solving the exponentially complex site selection problem, which combines a greedy search for coarse localization and a simulated annealing search for final location fine-tuning.  The algorithm provides accurate and timely results when evaluated against the government provided 1200 x1200 terrain cell challenge problems.  In Phase II, we propose to meet the larger challenge problem requirement (12,000 x 12,000 terrain cells), develop and demonstrate a Web Service application, and transition the technology into the operationally fielded GAPS Toolbox.  At the end of Phase II, the productizing of the application will be well under way in anticipation of technology transition.",

A video see-through display using a chroma-key is another option.  Head-mounted cameras register the \u2018blue-screens\u2019 and video capture hardware processes the final image by restricting the superimposed image to areas identified in the video.  The final result provides the user with a video of their surroundings and virtual images overlaying the blue-screens. Image quality is limited by the camera resolution and color registration is subject to sufficient lighting conditions.  In Phase I of this research we learned that a head-mounted projection display is limited by the quality of available retro-reflective screens and currently does not offer a viable option for a wide field-of-view display suitable for out-the-window simulation.  This proposal describes an innovative HMD design that integrates these technologies and leverages strengths from each, providing natural see-through, superior visual performance, and real-time occlusion of objects in the training environment.",

        "abstract": "Many airborne vehicles require thick polymeric coatings on complex, concave and convex surfaces, which may be metallic, composite, or ceramic. The common method for applying these coatings involves spraying many individual layers, and allowing solvent flash and drying between each layer. A coating which is built up to 0.250\u201d thickness, may require more than 100 layers of sprayed on coatings. This approach requires long staging times in a spray booth, issues with solvent emissions and abatement, detailed robotic programming to follow a complex curvature, and may still require grinding, sanding, and thickness measurement at the end to assure a uniform coating has been applied. Our proposed innovation allows for the injection molding of a thick coating in a single step directly on the aircraft. A tool which is machined to mate to the curvature of the substrate surface, providing a fixed spacing, can be mechanically or vacuum attached to the surface, creating an injection molding cavity. A thermosetting polymeric system can be mixed and injection molded into the cavity as a 100% solids formulation, thus eliminating all solvents. Once cured, the tool is removed manually or mechanically, depending on size, leaving the molded coating on the surface.",

This multi-purpose visualization solution is referred to as a switchable vision block (SVB).  In phase I, driver crew stations of the Abrams, Bradley, and Stryker were considered to determine which one was most amenable to the implementation of a SVB.  Based on space availability and possible occlusion of displays, we selected the M17 vision blocks in the Stryker driver compartment as the host for the SVB.  We also researched newly available optical and display components; view-mode switching techniques; micro-fabrication methodologies; and interface technologies to develop concepts for the SVB.  During Phase I we constructed an EO switch mirror based on a prior ORI concept. We developed six SVB configurations from which we down-selected to one on the basis of minimum number of optical elements and simplicity of the view mode switch.    The recommended SVB concept consists of an optical subsystem with three optical elements; a switch mirror; a display subsystem and an SVB to vehicle interface subsystem housed in an additional physical module below the basic vision block; and the SVB housing subsystem.    In phase II of this project, we will design, develop, characterize and demonstrate a prototype of the recommended SVB.  This will be done in two stages.  In stage 1, we will implement an SVB for stand alone demonstration in December, 2008.  In stage 2, an engineering prototype will be implemented for demonstration and evaluation in a Stryker driver compartment environment in December, 2009.

Importantly, this program will take full advantage of the testing and design work conducted during the SBIR Phase I effort and DARPA is generously offering available hardware developed during the MSEG program for use in this Phase II program.  The capacity of the proposed SPEAR system will take best advantage of this available hardware.  Sized to deliver 1.3 kW of electric power and 5.3 kW of cooling (1.5 tons of refrigeration), the SPEAR demonstration system will provide load following electric power, cooling and heating capability suitable for military electronics shelters.",

        "abstract": "Today\u2019s contemporary operating environment is filled with individuals and crowds that are tactical assets to adversaries.  When confronted by crowds, soldiers face the ambiguity of identifying who is friend or foe, and likely don\u2019t possess the requisite cross-cultural communication skills to adequately respond to rapidly changing threats.  Poor choices result in escalation of hostility threatening lives and the mission.  Learning appropriate skills to deal with individual and group behaviors is imperative; and a range of game-based technologies show promise to close the training gap.  Forterra and Charles River Analytics propose to integrate game technologies and crowd modeling approaches to produce a highly scalable virtual training system suitable for the COE.  We propose to build from Phase I efforts that analyzed architectures and capabilities of various technologies and to implement a working prototype system that will support distributed virtual training with large numbers of synthetic and virtual avatars in an asymmetric warfare environment.  A feasibility demonstration will be performed as a culminating event and a non-proprietary application programmer\u2019s interface will be published.  Emphasis will be placed on solutions than can be commercialized to support similar training needs in combat medicine, emergency preparedness, and related corporate training exercises.",

Extending Phase I and related technologies for the assessment of DC-DC switched mode power supplies, Impact will provide innovations that result in a new operations and maintenance support capability from embedded monitoring and enhanced built-in test to ground station and depot-level support. Key innovations in gray-scale health assessment, time to failure modeling, and diagnostic test integration will support a capability leveraging increased understanding of failure progression in electronic systems for improved test and maintenance. Working with AMRDEC, Engineering Support Division, in conjunction with the Apache program office, Impact will develop and test the prototype system on the Modernized Target Acquisition and Designation Sight (M-TADS) power supply. The technology will build upon previously developed DC-DC PHM technologies while innovating new AC-DC health management, more robust time to failure modeling, and test system innovations to enable broader deployment across maintenance levels. The integrated PHM system will maintain verticality of test, important for validation, supportability and maintainability of fielded systems.

These novel actuator concepts will require minimal electrical power for their operation and they are lightweight and occupy small volumes. The actuator concepts are very simple and modular in design; can provide linear and partial or full rotary actuation; are capable of being integrated into the structure of the projectile, mostly as load bearing structural components; and therefore have the potential of providing a very low cost actuator solution to almost any gun-fired munitions, both subsonic and supersonic, mortars and small missiles. Due to their basic design, the present actuation devices and their related components are well protected against very high firing acceleration loads, vibration, impact loading, repeated loading and acceleration and deceleration cycles that can be experienced during transportation and loading operations. The guidance and control system of a projectile equipped with the proposed actuation devices should be capable of achieving significantly enhanced precision for both stationary and moving targets, thereby achieving significantly greater probability of hit.",

Augmented reality, or the superposition of correctly orientated 3D models into the field of view using a head mounted display, could provide a way of bringing the realistic tactical behaviors seen in video games and military simulations to infantry training. A major hurdle in deploying this technology is the accurate determination of the soldier\u2019s position and head orientation in the environment. To overcome this problem Cybernet proposes the use of a hybrid sensor approach that determines the user\u2019s pose by fusing video data from an HMD mounted camera and a variety of other sensor modalities (MEMS accelerometers and gyroscopes, ground plane homography, GPS, and potentially LIDAR). To enhance the realism of the augmented reality simulation the system will provide a novel user interface that uses, position, voice, gait and stance detection, and gesture recognition, to interact with non-player characters in the simulation.

We propose a PackBot-Raven team to conduct sentry operations, including building surveillance and stakeout at points of exit/entry. While the Raven sends back visual data to the operator, the PackBot will independently be processing its own visual data, using its onboard algorithms to help determine which data may be of interest, and it will send an alert message to the operator.

The primary goal is to use airborne LIDAR data to generate 3D road network geometry augmented with physical attribution.  We will utilize RoadMAP, our road network extraction system, which currently performs local-area processing to extrapolate from a road starting point to delineate complete road features. Under this SBIR, we will incorporate both co-registered airborne LIDAR data to directly determine road height, pitch, and slope, and co-registered multi-spectral source (MSS) data to estimate surface material properties.  By pre-processing LIDAR/MSS imagery to create a \"traffickability map\", automated road starting points will be detected that contain likely avenues for roads. Our Phase I results demonstrate that creating the traffickability map successfully classifies road-like features regardless of whether they are in flat, sloped, or undulating terrain. The map is created in world coordinates so that other geo-referenced data can easily be correlated and incorporated into RoadMAP's decision making modules. Additionally, a machine learning module will be integrated into RoadMAP to improve the level of automation within the interactive road extraction process.",

MEMS technology made possible autonomous wireless sensor nodes via the use of widespread, tiny sensors in large numbers.  However, the sheer number of sensors requires a huge number of batteries, which can be very heavy, hard to deploy, and difficult to replace.  Large geographic coverage of surveillance sensors requiring hundreds or thousands of batteries, with a limited life span and temperature tolerance, may not be practical, especially due to their maintenance and replacing the discharged batteries in hostile territories.  Therefore, it is important to have a self-sufficient carefree power source that can generate electric power from its environment.  Maximizing the use of wireless sensors will reduce the cost of maintenance and manpower.

Due to increased electric field stress, it is a challenge to design large power densities in high voltage applications. Existing methods to address the high voltage issue, result in the introduction of undesired parasitic reactance, which adversely impacts the efficiency and reliability of the converter power stage. To properly address the problem, the research intends to investigate the technical feasibility of using a resonant topology to utilize the unwanted parasitic reactance in the power stage.",

One weak point in the current IFOG based navigation system the slip rings based data link. The slip ring suffers some rare intermittent faults, which are due to moisture trapped inside the slip ring. These glitches may cause big navigation errors in rate gyros like IFOG. Our solution to minimize these glitches caused by the slip rings is to replace the slip rings by an extremely reliable wireless data link. The design of this wireless data link for FOGN is difficult because FOGN uses a spherical gimbal set (SGS) and the only openings that RF signals can propagate through layers of gimbals are small pin holes. During Phase II of this project, we will design a wireless data link based on Multi-band Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (MB-OFDM) radio, and integrate it with Boeing\u2019s Micro-Thermal Control SGS to demonstrate that the proposed wireless data link is more reliable than slip rings.",

This wear life is a factor of 3 to 4 times the current C/C clutch material being used for the STOVL version of JSF (F-35B).  The experimental testing performed in Phase I has been done at full scale conditions (full speed and full inertial mass or engagement energy) using a custom built single rotor-single stator clutch test machine.  This full scale, full speed, full energy Phase I testing has eliminated the technical risk associated with extrapolating results from lower surface speed subscale test approaches that have previously been used.  In addition, RCI has one other friction material system also tested under full scale conditions whose friction behavior (dynamic coefficient of friction) is significantly higher than the current C/C friction material.  Higher COF values at high speed engagement conditions can greatly reduce clutch clamp load forces which will extend clutch rotating equipment (bearings, gears, etc.)life.  These advancements will be optimized early in Phase II and full up clutch test and demonstration work will be performed at Rolls Royce Corporation, Indianapolis, IN during the second half of the Phase II program.

        "abstract": "Although uncooled infrared imaging technology has made remarkable progress in the last two decades in resolution and sensitivity, a major limitation of 2-D infrared focal plane arrays is the lack of true on-chip spectral discrimination. Multi-spectral detection capabilities at the pixel level are especially beneficial for early threat warning applications in terrestrial or airborne surveillance since they enable rapid, efficient and multi-dimensional scene interpretation. Imaging systems that gather data in multiple spectral bands can discriminate both absolute temperature and unique spectral signatures of objects in the scene, and effectively reject spurious information and background clutter from an infrared image. The proposed Phase II effort aims at incorporating on-chip multi-spectral IR detection into commercial monolithic thermal imaging arrays. It builds on an innovative 3-D high-speed frequency-selective microbolometer array design developed in Phase I for demonstrating a three-color imaging FPA in the 8-14 \u00b5m spectral range without the need for cryogenic cooling or moving parts. Foster-Miller proposes to design, build and characterize breadboard-level prototypes of stackable arrays of wavelength-selective microbolometric sensors fabricated using standard IC microfabrication techniques.

Refinement of the key performance parameters will be carried out, and the integration of the ACDS into algal biodiesel production will be investigated. Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Large-scale biodiesel fuel production from algae should reduce the economic uncertainty tied to energy costs, increase national security due to less dependence on imported oil, and reduce environmental threats from global warming",

        "abstract": "High Intensity Discharge (HID) lamps are used extensively for large area lighting \u00bf such as for parking lots, streets, and warehouses \u00bf and are increasingly being used for general lighting in stores and homes.  Improving the efficiency of HID lamps would result in significant energy savings.  This project will develop an inexpensive, robust coating that is applied to the outside of an HID lamp and reflects IR and UV photons back into the lamp, thereby heating the plasma and generating a greater output of lumens for a given electrical energy input.  Moreover, this increase in efficiency will be achieved with a single-layer coating as opposed to the multilayer coatings that are expensive to apply and are not economically viable.  In Phase I, coatings were applied to off-the-shelf HID lamps, and photometric and thermal properties of the lamps were measured.  The results showed that the efficacy of coated HID lamps was up to 22% higher than that of uncoated lamps, with better color rendering.  Lifetime testing resulted in no degradation of the coating or bulb for hundreds of hours of operation.  Phase II will involve a two-pronged approach:  development of (1) a plug-replaceable coated HID lamp that can be used in existing lamp installations, with efficacy improvements of 10% to 15%; and (2) an optimized coated lamp/ballast system for new construction, with efficacy improvements of 20% to 25%. Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The single-layer coating developed in this project could be applied for pennies per bulb, and the deposition process will be compatible with large scale production.   Because HID lighting accounts for about 200 TWh per year in the U.S., a 20% increase in the efficacy of HID lamps would result in a savings of 40 TWh per year, based on present HID use.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Owing to certain intrinsic advantages, a surprisingly large number of upper-extremity amputees prefer simple cable operated prostheses and split hook terminal devices for many activities. For disadvantaged amputees in the United States and in developing countries, such systems often present the only viable restorative option. ADA Technologies and its supporting network of amputees and prosthetists believe a powerful way to help these users is to create a lightweight, robust, and corrosion resistant new split hook offering two refreshing functional improvements: 1) a means to readily adjust pinch force to match task need and to minimize the muscular energy expended effecting grasp; and 2) more visually appealing gripping contours that deliver stable, quality grasp without damaging the user's possessions. Consistent with ADA's mission to develop innovative new conventional prosthetic technologies that benefit users worldwide, the Primary Objective of this SBIR program is to create a versatile next-generation split hook terminal device that delights upper-extremity amputees in the United States and abroad and that can be manufactured for low cost to facilitate global distribution. In Phase I, functional grasping contours developed through previous research were combined with an innovative pinch force adjustment mechanism in a visually appealing design. Collaboration with outside fabricators ensured this design fully leverages materials and processes to minimize manufacturing cost. Field trials of the prototype device verify it delivers excellent grasp functionality, and evaluators enthusiastically praised its adjustable pinch force capability. Because ADA's split hook is lightweight and requires on average 53% less energy to operate than benchmark units, the company's expert advisors believe the device will significantly benefit transhumeral and at-risk amputees plagued by cumulative trauma injuries and trapezius muscle pathologies arising from prosthesis usage. Moreover, the device's low manufacturing cost, robustness, and immunity to galvanic corrosion make it ideal for disadvantaged amputees in developing countries, over 82% of whom survive by agrarian occupations. Phase II comprises establishing manufacturing infrastructure and validating the performance of production hardware under strenuous conditions representative of subsistence farming and ranching. Clinical testing with transhumeral amputee subjects will examine potential benefits of the device for these users. The company will also complete tasks required by law to launch its split hook as a commercial product into the worldwide marketplace. Phase III encompasses manufacturing and supplying the split hook to clinicians and humanitarian agencies in the United States and in developing countries. In keeping with the spirit and intent of the SBIR program, this approach maximally leverages NIH funding to directly benefit men and women who must cope daily with the limitations and consequences of upper-limb deficiencies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In the United States and developing countries, affordable upper-extremity prosthetic components are much needed as escalating costs and increasing technological sophistication have for many amputees placed most existing products out of reach. The split hook technology described here incorporates key functional innovations while leveraging new materials and manufacturing processes to benefit amputees who prefer conventional prostheses and those for whom few or no other options exist. The device is designed to delight users, improving their quality of life by helping them become or remain productive members of society through renewed self-sufficiency, sense of purpose, and personal dignity.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glycan (carbohydrate microarrays), carrying tens or hundreds of different sugars that are immobilized on solid surfaces in a spatially discrete pattern, possess a wide variety of potential applications in glycomics including rapid determination of the binding profile of carbohydrate-binding proteins, detection of specific antibodies for the diagnosis of diseases, characterization of carbohydrate-cell recognition events and the high-throughput screening of inhibitors to prevent carbohydrate-protein interactions. However, platforms that would enable construction of high quality carbohydrate microarrays and sensitive and rapid determination and characterization of carbohydrate-protein interactions have not kept pace with, for example, equivalent technology in genomic and proteomic research. To address this need, we have developed a unique novel 3-dimensional platform which we have demonstrated successfully for fabrication of high sensitive carbohydrate microarray in Phase I research; this platform could potentially allow us to screen thousands of different carbohydrate probes for binding to proteins including receptors and antibodies. In the Phase II project, we propose to build on our feasibility work to develop advanced carbohydrate microarray platform for high throughput glycan analysis. Specifically, we propose to (1) optimize a 3D glass-substrate microarray platform that will function with the existing fluorescent-based glycan analysis methods; (2) systematically compare of the effect of platform surface chemistry to glycan functions and epitope-displays; (3) develop epitope-defined high avidity N-glycan microarray for prostate cancer glycan-based biomarkers discovery, and (4) to develop 3D SPR substrate platform and a label-free surface plasma resonance (SPR) carbohydrate microarray system. The Phase II project results and deliverables will support the Phase II commercialization goals for implementing a Supercarbohydrate glass substrate for carbohydrate microarray fabrication that the fluorescent detection can be applied for the glycan analysis, and a Gold SPR platform substrate for carbohydrate microarray fabrication that the label-free detection can be applied for the glycan analysis. Follow-on products will include well-defined carbohydrate microarray for tumor biomarkers, and a label-free SPR imaging system for high throughput glycan analysis. The value of the platform substrates and the microarray system will bring to both the primary and secondary markets should attract large corporations as partners to support commercial development, marketing, and distribution.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Interactions between carbohydrates and proteins define a wide range of biochemical mechanisms in the human body. At present there is no commercially viable tool for rapid screening and investigation of these carbohydrate interactions. The proposed work will develop and demonstrate a microarray tool to allow researchers to probe carbohydrate biochemistry to elucidate disease and drug mechanisms and identify cancer biomarkers.",

        "abstract": "The proposed phase II project focuses on an economically and environmentally important project, which is to develop and document efficacy of wheat seed treatments that will increase yields and enable a reduction in nitrogen fertilizer use in this crop. Nitrogen fertilizer not taken up by crops is readily leached into waterways as nitrates and nitrates that enhance algal blooms that, when they decompose, result in hypoxic zones where plant and animal life cannot survive, thus giving rise to `dead zones' in lakes, bays and estuaries. It may also be converted to nitrous oxides that enter the atmosphere and contribute to global warming. The amounts of nitrogen fertilizer applied to wheat average about 75 lb/acre and there are about 60 million acres of wheat in the USA, so there are about 1.5 billion pounds of N fertilizer applied to wheat each year at a cost to farmers of about $375 to 750 million dollars. We anticipate that we can decrease the amount of N required to 50 lb/acre, for a cost savings of $120 to 240 million dollars. In addition, we expect to increase wheat yields by about 6 bushels (average with T. harzianum T22, which already is deployed on about 1 million acres of wheat; the new ones are expected to be better).",

Several compounds were tested in vivo and showed effective protection in rats challenged with lethal toxin and in mice infected with the spores of B. anthracis Sterne strain. The overall goal of this continuation project is to prove that the most promising candidate compounds are protective in relevant animal models of inhalational anthrax against the deadly Ames strain of Bacillus anthracis. The specific aims of the study are: (1) Synthesis, purification and in vitro characterization of the three previously selected most active 2-cyclodextrin derivatives. (2) Development and validation of analytical methods for the detection of cyclodextrins in biological samples. (3) Efficacy testing of three selected compounds in mice challenged with Bacillus anthracis (Ames Strain) using an aerosol route of infection. (4) Testing of the toxicity and pharmacokinetic properties of the two most potent compounds in rabbits. (5) Efficacy testing of the compounds in rabbits challenged with Bacillus anthracis (Ames Strain) using an aerosol route of infection to select drug candidates with the best protective and pharmacokinetic properties and lowest toxicity. In the long-term, in-depth preclinical tests and a Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy adults to demonstrate the drug's safety and tolerability will lead to the development of a new anti-anthrax treatment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bacillus anthracis is widely considered as one of the most likely biological weapons threats; however, there is currently no effective treatment for post-symptomatic inhalational anthrax. Traditional antibiotic therapy does not always work at this stage mainly because of the accumulation of anthrax toxin, which is considered a major virulence factor in anthrax infection. For this reason, there is an urgent need for the development of anti-toxin therapeutics, which could be administered after exposure as a supplement to traditional antibiotic intervention.",

To date, the workhorse in this area has been the SRF system developed by Cornell in the mid-1990\u00bfs for the CESR-B machine.  However, as the quest for higher performance continues, this system is being stretched beyond its design limits.  Required increases in input power, increases in detrimental higher order mode (HOM) power, and new requirements for pressure-vessel-code compliance demand an advanced design for these systems.  This project will adapt new developments in HOM absorbers to the development of an advanced SRF cryomodule system that provides higher luminosity.  Phase I developed conceptual designs for the cavity and cryomodule by implementing more-structurally-robust helium vessels and providing for a high power coaxial power coupler.  In addition, a concept for a next-generation HOM absorber, with broader frequency response and higher power capability, was developed.  Phase II will involve the fabrication of the cavity and cryomodule.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Newborn screening is currently performed by collecting dried bloodspots from infants and then sending them to a lab for analysis. Lysosomal storage diseases alone number greater than 40 and there is an increasing necessity to screen for a number of disease conditions for which therapies are becoming available. Tandem mass spectrometry is an excellent multiplex detection technology widely utilized in newborn screening, but when applied to enzyme assays it is very expensive, time consuming, labor intensive, and more importantly the multiplexing power of mass spectrometry is not leveraged because each assay has to be performed individually. There is a need for an inexpensive, rapid, automated, and scalable technology for performing newborn screening assays that a mass spectrometer is not well-suited to perform. A digital microfluidic system for performing enzymatic assays in newborn screening will enable walkaway automation and multiplex several assays very inexpensively. Based on Advanced Liquid Logic's successful demonstration of digital microfluidic manipulation of nanoliter-sized droplets of enzymatic reagents and sample for dispensing from on-chip reservoirs, high speed transport, mixing, splitting and dilution, and absorbance, fluorescence, and luminescence detection of the assays, a disposable lab-on-a- chip will be developed. In phase I, we have successfully demonstrated a multiplex fluorescence enzymatic assay on a digital microfluidic cartridge to setup screening for Pompe, Fabry, and Hurler disorders on dried blood spot samples. Phase II work will focus on increasing the throughput of the cartridge to screen for 6 lysosomal storage disorders for which therapies exist including Pompe, Fabry, Hurler, Hunter, Gaucher, and Maroteaux-Lamy, on 96 dried blood spot samples yielding a total of 576 enzymatic assays on a single cartridge. Also, a pilot screening study will be performed in collaboration with Duke University and North Carolina State Lab of Public Health, which would involve screening about 10,000 dried blood spots on the digital microfluidic platform. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Newborn screening is performed on every infant born in the US and there is a growing interest in increasing the number of conditions screened for. In this project, a digital microfluidic platform will be developed to screen for many treatable conditions simultaneously using much lesser volume of blood from an infant. It would be greatly useful in identifying treatable diseases earlier.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will develop a digital wireless streaming stereo audio system for the hearing impaired. Phase I has successfully demonstrated a novel technology that can be integrated fully into modern behind-the-ear hearing aids to receive audio from consumer electronics devices such as cell phones, televisions, stereos, and personal media devices. The system uses on a small transmitter that plugs into standard headphone jack to digitize and transmit the audio to the hearing aid. In hearing aids, capturing sound close to the source before it is combined with background noise offers better signal to noise ratio. In the case of consumer electronics devices, hearing aid users encounter difficulties with sound quality when using the integrated speakers of such devices. These devices often provide a standard audio output which offers a low noise signal. Existing methods to transmit audio signals to hearing aids from consumer electronics devices include Bluetooth, magnetic coupling (digital and analog), and FM. FM radios are prone to interference and distortion and are being replaced by digital wireless solutions. Bluetooth consumes too much power to be directly integrated into small hearing aids, so these solutions require larger batteries in modules external to the hearing aid. Magnetic coupling can be made low power but can only transmit for short distances. There are many reasons why previous connectivity systems have experienced poor adoption rates and most are related to the intermediate relay module found in current solutions. The proposed solution will be the first to eliminate this relay module to allow direct long-range transmission to a micro behind-the-ear (BTE) hearing aid. The proposed wireless technology will offer larger distances (15 ft.) than magnetic coupling solutions and lower power (less than 200uW) than all digital alternatives. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: According to a Better Hearing Institute's (BHI) recent survey of 56,000 households, 31.5 million Americans have hearing loss. Hearing loss affects 1 in 10 Americans and 1 in 4 households. Furthermore while 95% of individuals with hearing loss could be successfully treated with hearing aids, only 23% currently use them.

        "abstract": "The recent emergence of the Silicon Drift detector (SDD), for use in energy dispersive x-ray spectrometry (EDS), has made possible x-ray event streams with count rates as high as 1-10 Mcps. A problem with existing digital signal processing, as applied to SDDs, is the significant presence of coincidence peaks above the x-ray background. These coincidence peaks occur with amplitudes comparable to low-concentration species. In specimens with x-ray peaks arising from two or more elemental constituents, the coincidence peaks can occupy a sizeable portion of the spectrum between the high abundance peaks, leading to false identification of elements and significant errors in quantification. NIST seeks advanced digital signal processing techniques to overcome this severe limitation to SDD application. The objective of the Phase II work is to provide NIST a prototype digital pulse processor that demonstrates an order-of-magnitude reduction in coincidence counting, at an output count rate of 500,000 cps. Our Phase I work and continuing development in anticipation of a Phase II award suggest that the requirement can be met and likely exceeded, with the additional bonus that other parts of the event stream can also be recovered instead of rejected, leading to significant improvements over current state-of-the-art pulse processing.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II seeks to develop a surface texturing technique that will significantly improve sunlight coupling into various types of solar cells. Surface textures are mandatory to record efficiencies in solar cells. The Omni-Directional Antireflective Coating (Omni-AR) solution showed a reduction in reflection in a large range of incident angles (omni-directional) over a broad spectral range (400-1200 nm). Improved solar cell efficiency of over 10% was demonstrated (experimentally).  The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be a low-cost, broad-spectrum, omni-directional and substrate-independent surface texture antireflective coating. It is expected to have a significant impact on current and future solar cell technologies. The ability to provide near ideal performance of antireflective coatings to solar cells without a vacuum process is a major step in reducing the cost of solar electricity. This solution-based deposition technique makes it possible to provide a single coating technology that should work with all types of solar cell materials and structures. This project will significantly improve the conversion efficiency in both current and future solar cells (~10%) with a minimum cost increase (~4%).  This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).",

        "abstract": "This proposal addresses the planned improvements to advance the Rotorcraft Comprehensive Analysis System (RCAS) during Phase II of this SBIR. Significant improvements will be implemented to expand RCAS functionality, accuracy, and usability. RCAS functionality will be greatly expanded with the addition of new complex rotorcraft components that allow users to model exotic configurations easily and with high fidelity. The functionality and accuracy of RCAS aerodynamics calculations will be enhanced through updates to the airloads, induced velocity, and interference aerodynamics models. In addition, the airloads calculations will be improved through the expansion of the Peters, Hsieh, and Torrero airloads module implemented in Phase I of this SBIR. Improvements to convergence characteristics, and the implementation of more robust routines for handling program data, will make RCAS much more efficient when modeling large and complex models. RCAS user efficiency will be improved through the coupling of RCAS with widely used external programs to allow users to easily import/export data between programs. To improve RCAS usability, an intuitive graphical user interface for model input, analysis, and output will be implemented. The graphical user interface, designed in Phase I of this SBIR, will greatly enhance user efficiency and confidence through improved feedback, flexibility, and help.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes the development of a web-based collaborative Virtual Learning Environment for teaching freshman university physics, called the Virtual Physics Lab (VPL). The VPL will deliver an individualized self-paced learning experience using high-end multimedia lectures, and interactive virtual-reality simulations. The multimedia lectures are delivered using a synchronized multimodal combination of both highlighted text and speech that is delivered by near-photorealistic intelligent animated virtual instructors. The multimedia lectures include interactive Flash animations, movies, and 2D/3D animated illustrations. The VPL's interactive simulations are delivered in a video-game-like 3D virtual environment using physics-based models to simulate physics concepts such as pendulums, impact, buoyancy, magnetism etc. The VPL is highly interactive and uses pre-topic, in-topic, and post-topic questions to keep students engaged and to assess whether or not students need further training in any given subject. The VPL also includes collaborative/competitive mini 3D computer games that use relevant physics principles to increase the students' interest about the material being taught, and to add entertainment and competitive dimensions to the learning experience. The VPL's interactivity and the visually stimulating instruction will result in faster assimilation, deeper understanding, and higher memory retention by the students than traditional\ntext-book/classroom learning.  The VPL has the potential to radically change the way physics is taught. Due to the current exponential rate of increase in human scientific and technical knowledge, there is a need for students to assimilate more knowledge at a faster rate. Current classroom and text-book instruction delivery methods cannot satisfy this need due to a variety of reasons, including, delivery of the lecture in non-engaging and minimally interactive way, use of antiquated static graphical illustrations, variability of teacher skill, lack of one-on-one teacher attention, and variability of student learning styles and speeds. The VPL will help overcome those limitations. Particularly, it will enhance the quality, accessibility, and speed of learning. It will enhance the student experimentation, creativity and problem-solving capability. Freshman university physics was chosen because it is one of the essential foundations for training high-caliber engineers and scientists who will ensure the continued leadership of the US in developing new technologies and in conducting cutting-edge scientific research. The US market for the proposed learning tool is estimated at 500,000 licenses per year. A larger market exists worldwide in English language speaking countries, and for future versions of the VPL that will be translated into other languages.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The main objective of this project is to develop a new therapeutic to improve the outcome for patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer. The indication is a first-line adjuvant to be combined with radiation therapy for prostate cancer. The desired outcomes are improved local control rate, decreased recurrence and improved disease-free survival. This grant will enable development and evaluation of ProstAtak(tm), a product aimed at improving the outcome of prostate cancer patients, in a randomized Phase 2 clinical study. Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in men in the US with approximately 30,000 deaths expected in 2006. Current therapies provide an excellent 5yr survival prognosis for the 230,000 new annual diagnoses. However, each year 60,000-100,000 men develop prostate cancer recurrence for which they receive surgical or pharmacologic castration, a life extending but non-curative therapy. Castration negatively impacts quality of life. Drugs that decrease recurrence of prostate cancer and do not diminish current success from standard therapies would be of great significance. ProstAtak(tm) is a biologic drug composed of an adenoviral vector with the Herpes thymidine-kinase gene (AdV-tk) formulated for prostate delivery followed by an oral antiherpetic prodrug. When combined with standard surgery or radiation, ProstAtak(tm) has been shown to generate a systemic vaccine effect through a technology termed gene mediated cytotoxic immunotherapy (GMCI(tm)). AdV-tk, the principal component of ProstAtak(tm), has an excellent safety profile with over 300 patient doses delivered in multiple Phase 1 studies, and a non-randomized Phase 2 study. Prostate cancer has shown susceptibility to ProstAtak(tm) alone, and in the context of GMCI(tm) with radiation. The purpose of this application is to support design, implementation and evaluation of a randomized Phase 2 controlled trial of ProstAtak(tm) with radiation compared to placebo with radiation in localized intermediate-risk prostate cancer. A working group of urology, radiation therapy, pathology, immunology and biostatistics experts from top academic institutions has been assembled to collaborate in the development and conduct the proposed studies. A clinical protocol from this group has been prepared. The intermediate-risk group was selected based on positive results from the non-randomized study, the potential to differentiate outcomes in this patient population, and because standard treatment for this stage provides an opportunity to easily incorporate GMCI(tm) without adding significant discomfort to the patients. The proposed trial will be the first to prospectively evaluate efficacy of AdV-tk in humans and, if successful, may lead to the first drug with early stage prostate cancer as its primary indication. A secondary objective is to prospectively evaluate surrogate end-points for early stage prostate cancer.",

        "abstract": "Ammonia has an important role in the chemistry of the atmospheric environment and air quality.  Ammonia emissions are a major environmental concern, yet they remain poorly quantified.  There is a need for a sensitive ammonia instrument to monitor emissions and evaluate their effects on local and regional environments.  An instrument capable of continuous monitoring is required to understand diurnal patterns, trends, and correlations of ammonia with other atmospheric species including particulates.  This instrument needs to be portable, operationally simple, and affordable to be relevant to widespread ammonia measurements.  In the Phase I program we demonstrated feasibility of developing a lower cost, highly sensitive compact instrument for autonomous real time monitoring of ammonia.  The instrument is based upon Tunable Infrared Laser Differential Absorption Spectroscopy (TILDAS) using Quantum Cascade lasers.  We identified two possible cell designs for the instrument:  an in-line astigmatic multipass cell design and a second novel cell design using low cost components.  We have designed lower cost collection optics and simpler cooling approaches for the laser and detector.  The incorporation of these innovations and a novel cell will lead to a lower cost, more commercial air monitoring instrument for ammonia and other important atmospheric tract gases.  The objective of the Phase II project is to fabricate and demonstrate a fully functional, affordable, highly sensitive, rapid response, robust and portable instrument for autonomous real time monitoring of ammonia.  The instrument will have compact size to fit in a rack mountable box and be capable of long term monitoring.  The instrument will use mid-infrared quantum cascade laser absorption to accurately quantify ammonia with a precision of 0.3 parts per billion (PPBV) in a 1 second measurement without cryogens or calibration gases.  The reduced cost ammonia monitor will be possible with the develop-ment of our novel multipass absorption cell. The cell will allow design of an instrument that is reduced to its optical essentials\u00bflittle more than a laser, an absorption volume and a detector.  The cell will be either an in-line astigmatic cell or a novel proprietary multipass cell based on low cost components.  The development of a sensitive, affordable instrument for ammonia detection has wide benefits for atmospheric and environmental research.  This novel compact QCL instrument will have extensive commercial applications in areas such as air pollution and air toxics monitoring, regulatory monitoring, breath analysis for medical diagnostics, combustion exhaust research, and plasma diagnostics for semiconductor fabrication.",

In order to predict future carbon dioxide concentrations under various mitigation strategies, a much better quantitative understanding of the sources and sinks of atmospheric carbon dioxide is required.

Because of the coupling of the water and carbon dioxide cycles, measurements of isotopic water vapor also are required to quantify the carbon cycle.  This project will develop an advanced laser-based instrument for the simultaneous real-time measurement of isotopologues of CO2 and H2O.  This instrument will be suitable for field-measurement of isotopic fluxes by eddy covariance, allowing the determination of wide area emission and deposition of CO2, and allowing the partition between plant photosynthesis and respiration fluxes.

This concentrator can serve as a suitable inlet for the miniature particle collector being developed under the parent project; and that will also be suitable for many other exposure, toxicology and ultrafine particle characterization applications.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Over 6.3 million fractures occur each year in the United States alone (Praemer et al. 1999) and approximately 15% of fractures exhibit delayed or impaired healing. The clinical applications currently used to treat delayed fracture require open surgery to insert an autologous bone graft. If open surgery is confounded by co-morbidity or is deemed otherwise undesirable, a minimally invasive injectable therapy would provide patients and physicians with another treatment option. Growth factors, particularly bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are employed for a range of indications including spinal fusion and fracture healing due to their potent osteogenic activity (Mont et al. 2004). An injectable BMP carrier would provide a carrier for the minimally invasive application of this powerful family of therapeutic molecules. (*1) During the Phase I funding period, we explored a novel approach toward developing an injectable delivery system for BMPs, specifically FDA-approved BMP-2. We generated two formulations for this potential product: a collagen matrix on which BMP-2 binding peptides were covalently attached and a second where a collagen matrix was mixed with a bifunctional peptide, comprised of a binding domain with high-affinity for collagen and another domain with high-affinity for BMP-2. The first formulation fulfilled our in vitro efficacy criteria, but failed to form a stable hydrogel leading to its failure in our in vivo osteoinduction model. The second formulation, containing bifunctional BMP-2: collagen peptides appeared to satisfy both our in vitro and in vivo performance criteria. The technology developed in Phase 1, and proposed here for commercial optimization in Phase 2, represents a unique biomaterial, potentially useful for a number of medical indications. Our Phase 2 proposal has 3 discrete aims: 1) optimize peptide sequence and synthesis for commercial scale production and formulation; 2) examine the biocompatibility, toxicity and stability of each modified hydrogel and 3) test the in vivo osteogenic efficacy of our injectable carriers in a rabbit osteotomy model. The development of a new delivery matrix, using peptide binders for BMP-2, may allow for a greater degree of controlled growth factor release. Specifically, an injectable BMP-2 formulation would allow for the treatment of fractures with a minimally invasive procedure. Broadly applied, injectable growth factors are likely to enhance the biological components of healing, encouraging simpler surgical intervention, faster healing and improved outcomes. By combining noninvasive injectability with a targeted, molecular therapy we hope to increase localized retention of biologics while decreasing their dosages, and concomitant expense. (*3) We feel this platform for BMP-2 delivery could be used as a model for other growth factors, such as PDGF-BB, TGF-3 or GDF7, for which Affinergy has already developed high-affinity binding peptides. Guiding our prototype BMP-2 delivery system toward commercialization represents our first step toward investigating the broad applications of injectable growth factors. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Growth factors called Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMPs) are currently used to promote osteogenesis and fracture healing. Over 6.3 million fractures occur each year in the United States alone and approximately 15% of fractures exhibit delayed or impaired healing. The clinical applications currently in use, however, require open surgery to insert the carrier/BMP combination at the site of healing. There would be considerable clinical benefit from the ability to deliver BMPs via a minimally invasive procedure. In this proposal, we present a novel approach to continue the development of an injectable delivery system for BMP-2 that improves the retention and effectiveness of a growth factor at the site of repair. Expanding this technology to other therapeutic proteins could generate novel interventions for additional medical indications.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Of the nearly 5 million patients who visit a physician for tendon pain each year in the US, approximately 200,000 go on to have a surgical repair. And while surgical repair has a high-rate of symptom relief, recovering patients are routinely immobilized for several months. Increased tendon strength, during shorter time courses has been reported in animal models using the localized delivery of growth factors with surgical tendon repair. In particular, the growth and differentiation factors 5 and 7 (GDF5 and GDF7) are required for proper tendon formation, and have been shown to dramatically improve healing when applied to damaged tendon tissue. Here we propose the manufacture of a peptide-based coating, permitting the loading of these growth factors to the sutures used during surgical repair of tendon tissue to promote their sustained release. Using phage display technology, Affinergy has screened libraries expressing billions of peptide sequences, searching for those peptides which bind biologic therapeutics and synthetic materials. From previously identified peptides, several were identified which bind to suture materials, however GDF7/5 binding peptides were not immediately available from those already synthesized. Therefore a new round of phage display biopanning was performed with immobilized GDF7 as a target. For this round of phage display, a focused phage library was used, originally designed to find peptides specific for BMP-2, another TGF-  superfamily member. This library revealed several peptide sequences capable of binding GDF7 with sub  M affinity. After identifying these sequences, a conjugation strategy, attaching suture- and GDF7-binding peptides through a biotin:streptavidin system, was used to test their potential efficacy as a bifunctional linker molecule. These conjugates were capable of retaining bioactive GDF7 to a suture surface, as well as sustaining its release to surrounding cells. Finally, these peptides were synthesized as one continuous linear peptide, to generate a bifunctional peptide, which did not exhibit similar affinity compared to the streptavidin conjugate linkers. New IFBM formulations are therefore proposed, which replicate the peptide composition and orientation of the streptavidin conjugated molecules. Early optimization of IFBMs using new linkage chemistries and orientations have resulted in bifunctional peptides which enhance GDF7 attachment to suture surfaces. We are therefore eager to initiate additional optimization activities to further enhance these peptides. These data provide initial proof-of-concept evidence that bioactive GDF7 can be delivered on the surface of sutures through a novel GDF7:suture binding peptide. Exploring the in vivo function, and initiating product development is now essential to determine the therapeutic efficacy and commercial viability of this growth factor delivery platform.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: With the most active senior generation in history rapidly emerging, the need for innovative therapeutics to treat problematic joints and tendons continues to grow. Here we present data from the successful completion of our Phase I research program, developing a peptide-based suture coating for the controlled delivery of growth and differentiation factors (GDFs) to surgically repaired tendons. The prototype coating developed in Phase I will be further optimized in Phase II, using new peptide conjugation and ligation chemistries devised by Affinergy. We will also further validate our peptide coatings in preparation for an in vivo animal model of surgical tendon repair. These animal studies will provide the first evidence for the efficacy and feasibility of our peptides for the localized delivery of GDF on suture after surgical repair.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Infection surrounding metal implants is a common and sometimes devastating cause of implant failure in a number of fields including oral, craniomaxillofacial (CMF), orthopedic, and cardiovascular surgery. These infections, which arise from the establishment of biofilms on device surfaces, not only necessitate new surgeries but in themselves present a significant threat to life and limb. New technologies that decrease microbial colonization of metal implants would reduce these infections, mitigating their severity. Affinergy has developed bifunctional affinity peptides, called interfacial biomaterials (IFBMs), that promote the attachment and retention of drugs, proteins, and cells on the surface of medical devices. Using phage display, we have identified specific peptide sequences that bind with high affinity to a number of metals and another specific set of peptide sequences that bind with high affinity to vancomycin. Linear synthesis of these sequences as a single IFBM permits the attachment of vancomycin directly to the surface of a metal implant at point-of-care. However, Affinergy's current drug delivery coatings are limited to stoichiometric interaction between a single peptide molecule and an antibiotic. To increase the amount of antibiotic loading per surface area, we have developed self-assembling peptides (SAPs) comprised of the lead parent metal-binding and vancomycin-binding peptides, which appear to assemble into higher-order nanostructures. SAPs enhance vancomycin loading on metal by 20-fold relative to IFBMs. The goal of this proposal is to use our lead SAPs to generate a three-dimensional surface coating from self-assembling affinity peptides, capable of binding and retaining significantly higher concentrations of a drug to a device surface. Our preliminary data suggests that SAPs show improved vancomycin loading and efficacy in antimicrobial assays. This research program is designed to further development of a prototype self assembling coating system, attaching vancomycin to metal at point of care. In Aim 1, we will optimize the primary structure and formulation of the vancomycin- and metal-binding SAPs, as well as deveop a strategy for commercial scale synthesis. In Aim 2, we will assess SAP stability in biological fluids and confirm the peptides' biocompatibility and retention of function following storage and sterilization. Finally, in Aim 3, we will characterize the in vivo antimicrobial activity of vancomycin linked to metals using our lead candidate SAP formulation. Successful completion of these aims will provide us with the data necessary to establish relationships with large medical device companies, whose resources will be leveraged to achieve Affinergy's goal of bringing an improved antimicrobial device coating system to market. In addition, the modular nature of this technology may lead to rapid development of follow-on products with SAPs for other drugs or binding materials.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Infection surrounding metal hardware is a common and sometimes devastating cause of implant failure in a number of medical fields including oral, craniomaxillofacial (CMF), orthopedic, and cardiovascular surgery. Infections arising from the establishment of pathogenic biofilms on device surfaces not only necessitate new surgeries but in themselves present a significant threat to life and limb. Bacteria established on metal hardware within a biofilm are essentially impossible to eradicate by means other than explanation. Methods that decrease infection rates associated with metal implants would clearly benefit society and significantly reduce healthcare costs. We propose to develop a self-assembling affinity peptide coating that will promote attachment of antibiotics at point of care to a wide range of metal implants to decrease microbial colonization on their surfaces.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunts are used to treat pediatric and neonatal hydrocephalus in severe cases, representing approximately 1/3rd of affected infants. Due to the high susceptibility for infection and mechanical breakdown, the failure rate of VP shunts is around 30-40%. A need therefore exists to improve infection prevention for this procedure, likely by reducing microbial colonization and subsequent biofilm formation on the surface of these indwelling materials. The shunt itself is composed of a plastic valve, with silicone tubing leading from the lateral ventricle to a benign region where evacuated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) can be reabsorbed. The majority of infection occurs within 2 months of implantation, and has been attributed to skin-dwelling flora. Therefore viscerally-derived infections are not typical. External ventricular drains (EVDs), which drain CSF externally, also exhibit similar infection rates from these sources. Current strategies to prevent infections represent a range of medical practices and technological advances. Systemic antibiotic administration is commonly used perioperatively but has been reported to exert a limited effect on infection rates. Using antibiotic impregnated materials for localized prevention of microbial colonization has become an exciting new prevention strategy validated through several clinical studies. The proposal here uses a novel antimicrobial approach, using high affinity peptide coatings to attach antibiotics noncovalently to VP shunt tubing. Affinergy has developed a range of peptides capable of binding implanted biomaterials, and therapeutic agents which we have termed interfacial biomaterials (IFBMs). During the Phase I funding period, we identified peptides which bind to the silicone tubing of a VP shunt, and combined this sequence with our known antibiotic-binding peptides against vancomycin. We demonstrated the capability of this vancomycin:silicone IFBM to load and deliver vancomycin on the plastic tubing of a VP shunt to prevent infection. Further, we demonstrated the antimicrobial efficacy of the vancomycin:silicone IFBM in vitro and performed preliminary biocompatibility testing on the peptide. Similar results were obtained using vancomycin-loaded microparticle delivery from a PLGA:silicone IFBM. Clinically, our IFBM-mediated delivery approach has several advantages including: 1) surgeons can choose any shunting materials or more than one class of antibiotics that best suit the patient rather than having one particular product with the antibiotic treatment material; 2) peptide and antibiotic combinations can be applied to shunts at point-of-care, minutes before their implantation and 3) and drug-binding modules can be interchanged for new therapeutic strategies. Successful completion of this Phase II program will result in a peptide-based antibiotic delivery prototype, ready for further Phase III studies of in vivo efficacy. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Because ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunts exhibit a high rate of infection, there exists a strong need to enhance their ability to withstand microbial colonization. While current strategies involve impregnating these materials with antibiotics, new treatments will hopefully allow physicians to apply their choice of antibiotic on any VP shunt material. The coatings developed by Affinergy employ bifunctional, high-affinity peptides to attach therapeutic molecules to an implanted material surface. During this research program, we will continue testing of our vancomycin:silicone IFBM peptide capable of delivering vancomycin to VP shunts. Here, we will develop peptide components to attach alternative antibiotics, optimize our lead IFBM for product development and conduct more exhaustive biocompatibility testing, and test its antimicrobial efficacy in an in vivo infection model. Completion of this Phase II program will result in a peptide-based antibiotic delivery prototype, ready for Phase III studies to continue moving this IFBM into development.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project aims to develop talactoferrin (TLF, recombinant human lactoferrin) as a therapeutic agent to treat prematurely born neonates. The treatment will be given orally shortly after birth to prevent nosocomial infections (NIs) due to abnormal bacterial invasion of neonatal intestinal epithelia and consequently to limit systemic bacteremia and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). The overall incidence of prospectively studied NIs in hospitalized neonates has been reported to be 10.8 NI/100 patients. The incidence increases with decreasing birth weight, being as high as 81.8 NI/100 patients in Very Low Birth Weight group (birth weight lt 1500 g). Recent data from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development-sponsored  Neonatal Network  indicated that 29% of infants born at 25 to 28 weeks' gestation and 46% of infants born at less than 25 weeks' gestation experience a serious NIs during hospitalization in the NICU. The most common NI sites were sepsis and NEC. We therefore focus development of TLF on providing a sustained way to prevent and treat consequences of NIs in infants born prematurely and weighing from 750 to 1500 g at birth. The study shall enroll a total of 396 infants in a double-blind, randomized prospective study where TLF or placebo will be administered, in addition to the standard of care, to preterm infants before 24 hours of age. The study shall consist of four study groups: 1) mother's milk + placebo, 2) mother's milk + TLF, 3) formula feeding + placebo, and 4) formula feeding + TLF. The Phase-I part of the study shall determine the safety of TLF (at a dose of 300 mg/kg) when administered orally for 30 days. Using the total of (4 x 30) = 120 patients, safety of TLF shall be evaluated by determining the incidence and severity of adverse clinical events including laboratory and radiographic abnormalities. It is anticipated that adverse events might not be related to TLF, but rather to preterm birth, and TLF may mitigate those complications of prematurity [e.g., bronchopulmonary dysplasia]. The subsequent, continuous Phase-II part of the study shall ascertain the efficacy of TLF to enhance post-natal growth and to attenuate the incidence of nosocomial infections (including bacteremia, pneumonia, urinary infection, necrotizing enterocolitis [NEC] plus  NEC scares , and meningitis). All 396 patients recruited into the study (Phase I and Phase II) shall be used to evaluate efficacy of TLF. The Primary Endpoint shall be the time to regain birth weight, daily weight gain, and number of days to hospital discharge, Incidence of nosocomial infections [late-onset bacteremia, pneumonia, necrotizing enterocolitis, urinary tract infection, and meningitis] and incidence of  NEC Scares ,  neonatal sepsis syndrome  or  systemic inflammatory response syndrome  without proven evidence of infection. Additionally, Secondary Efficacy Parameters shall evaluate the number of days on mechanical ventilation and/or nasal positive airway pressure, number of days on supplemental oxygen, and overall morbidity and mortality (%). A consortium of clinical centers has been formed to ensure adequate number of patients and the rate of recruitment to complete the project within 2 years from its initiation. The consortium includes the Southern Illinois University School of Medicine (St. John's Children's Hospital), The University of Louisville (Kosair Children's Hospital and the University of Louisville Hospital) and University of Southern California (Children's Hospital of Los Angeles and Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center). Effectiveness of TLF in controlling NIs in neonates would likely find a logical extension to other populations of patients. More than 2,000,000 NIs occur each year in the USA (in infants and adults). This represents a major unmet medical need as well as a significant market. Marketing approval for TLF to treat NIs would be of great benefit to the patients and the community, and would also be of a substantial commercial value.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Barrier membranes are an important adjunct to regeneration therapy aimed at restoring the form and function of the mouth. Commercially available barrier membranes are used in dental surgeries to help retain bone grafting materials, to help exclude epithelium and connective tissue from entering into sites of desired bone and ligament regeneration, or for the combination of these reasons. Whether restoring lost bone around teeth or implants, or in larger areas of the jaws affected by trauma or disease, too often there is inadequate gum tissue to cover the membranes which can lead to membrane exposure, extensive membrane contamination, and procedural failure which is unacceptable. Our data suggests that biologically activating membranes made of chitosan (a versatile, biocompatible, resorbable material used in wound bandages) with our proprietary biologic - a small and soluble heparan sulfate-rich co-activator of growth factors - hastens gingival healing over exposed membranes in the mouth. RandD for this project is directed at development of a bioactivated chitosan regenerative membrane that is highly effective in maintaining gingival health and integrity where membranes are unavoidably exposed to the oral environment after placement, thereby promoting more predictable outcomes for a wider range of regenerative procedures in the mouth. RandD for this project falls along three lines: biologic development, membrane development, and in vivo testing. More specifically, we will 1) advance the prototype biologic used in phase 1 studies, 2) advance our chitosan membrane formulations to incorporate bioactivation with the most clinically appropriate handling characteristics, and 3) test the product candidates in animal models for efficacy. Toxicology and safety testing will be performed with the goal of having product candidate(s) ready for human clinical trials by the end of this phase 2 project. We expect this technology to improve success rates of oral bone regenerative procedures to treat periodontal disease, to place dental implants, and in cases where maxillofacial reconstruction is needed, therefore meeting patient needs and commercial needs in a large market. There is an absence in today's standard of care for bioactivated regenerative membranes and this proposed technology addresses that need with a rationally designed RandD plan with an understanding of the existing market, competitors, or potential partners.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Agenta is developing biologically enhanced regenerative membranes that are used in surgical procedures such as bone grafting. Bone regeneration is often necessary and critical to successful restoration of form and function in the mouth, and procedures called guided tissue regeneration using barrier membranes are essential to achieving optimal results. Whether restoring lost bone around teeth or implants, or in larger areas of the jaws affected by trauma or disease, too often there is inadequate gum tissue to cover the membranes and the graft sites which can lead to membrane exposure and procedural failure. Our data suggests that augmenting membranes made of chitosan (an excellent biodegradable material used in wound bandages) with our proprietary biologic improves gingival healing over exposed membranes in the mouth. Chitosan is a versatile, biocompatible, resorbable matrix with hemostatic and antimicrobial properties. Our goal is to provide chitosan with the additional biological advantage of enhancing wound closure with our proposed technology. We expect this technology to improve success rates of oral bone regenerative procedures to treat periodontal disease, to place dental implants, and in cases where maxillofacial reconstruction is needed, therefore meeting patient needs and commercial needs in a large market.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will build a Scalable Game Design tool and curriculum, with the goal of increasing the participation of students in Computer Science (CS). K-12 computer education fails to attract the necessary number of students to CS - especially at the middle school level, where students make critical career decisions by judging their own aptitudes towards math and science. This is a serious problem because, despite the growing need for IT workers, enrollment in undergraduate CS programs is dropping at alarming rates. Scalable Game Design provides an ideal balance between motivational and academic concerns of CS. This approach is based on the existing Fluency with Information Technology framework recommended by the National Academies of Sciences and will be aligned with the emerging National IT education standards (ISTE NETS). This project will explore Scalable Game Design by building a low-threshold, high-ceiling design tool, called AgentCubes, featuring Incremental 3D modeling, animation, programming, and visualization. The project will incorporate the tool into a 3D Gamelet Design curriculum to provide an attractive route to the effective design, development, and deployment of an exceptionally large spectrum of games - ranging from simple 2D Frogger-like games to 3D Sims-type games.  The proposed technology has a high potential to increase the number of K-12 students interested in Computer Science (CS), which in turn should result in larger enrollments at the university level. Without stronger CS enrollments the US cannot maintain an internationally competitive IT workforce. A less programming-focused, more\ndesign-based IT curriculum is likely to increase the participation of women and minorities. Initial results from our  feasibility study indicate that Incremental 3D approaches work across ethnicity and gender. The proposed 3-stage classroom integration strategy is based on a pipeline of required, elective, and transitional modules that introduce students to making simple games, move to more advanced games and computational science applications, and transition to traditional programming models. This strategy maximizes the exposure of public schools students in general, and women and minorities in particular, to computer science because all students will at least take the required one-week module. Furthermore, as a general end-user tool to create interactive 3D applications, the proposed technology will be useful beyond educational game design. Potential applications include computational science simulations, computational thinking tools and serious games with potential users such as university students, scientists, and engineers.",

        "abstract": "An inexpensive imaging instrument to quickly locate leaks of methane and other greenhouse and VOC gases would reduce that cost and effort expended by industry to comply with EPA regulations.  In Phase I of this SBIR program, a new gas leak visualization camera was demonstrated using Agiltron\u00bfs infrared image sensor, which our company has under advanced development and expects to manufacture in large volumes at much lower cost than any existing technology.  In Phase I, using methane as an example target gas, we were able to detect leaks on the order of 10 SCFH with only ambient IR illumination, by using our sensor together with proprietary methods of optical filtering and image processing.  Building on this proof of principle, the Phase II prototype will be 10X more sensitive and entirely free of false alarms.  The final product will be smaller, lighter, and much less expensive than any competing system, about $2,000 end user cost compared to $70 - 100K for currently available solutions.  This will enable wide distribution in industries such as refineries and pipelines and for local businesses including natural gas maintenance, supermarkets and automotive and HVAC repair shops.  In addition to methane, a wide variety of gases with absorption bans in the 6 \u00bf 12 \u00bfm IR range can be detected including SF6 and refrigerants, supporting compliance with EPA regulations for VOC and greenhouse gases.  The unit is switched in sensitivity form one gas to another with a user-changeable filter.  In Phase II Agiltron proposes to develop and test a prototype methane product which will incorporate sophisticated software algorithms and optimized optical designs to reach higher sensitivities along with ruggedness and east of use.  An LCD display will show an overlay of the gas leak plume with an ordinary visual image, making it easy for relatively untrained personnel to locate leaks very quickly.

        "abstract": "Non-Meat and Poultry Product (Non-MPP) food processing plants manage their effluent to satisfy environmental regulations concerning waste discharge. Currently, many non-MPP plants mechanically screen out large pieces of organic material (biosolids) that are processed for use as livestock feed. However, minute biosolids in liquid suspension collected from the food plant's effluent are generally disposed of by land application or by land filling due to contamination by chemicals used to flocculate the biosolids out of the wastewater. APS previously demonstrated the technical and economic feasibility of using PFC, a new flocculation compound, across a broad spectrum of non-MPP food processing industry segments to recover from non-MPP plant processing/waste water unadulterated digestible nutrients useable as livestock feed. The first objective of this project is to determine the actual cost impact of utilizing PFC under full-plant operating conditions to collect significant amounts of biosolids from the processing/waste water generated from a select number of non-MPP food processing plants. The second objective of this project is to conduct livestock feeding trials to determine the impact on growth performance and feed efficiency from utilizing the PFC-collected biosolids as significant inputs in test rations. The third objective of this project is to conduct tissue and bone analysis from a cross-section of test animals to evaluate the retention by these animals of the residual chemical components of PFC contained in the test diet. APS will temporarily modify the processing/waste water treatment system at each targeted non-MPP food processing plant to allow for the treatment of the effluent with PFC in a manner that will allow for the recovery of the biosolids contained in liquid suspension and to record the necessary input and output parameters to satisfy objective one. The recovered biosolids will be utilized in university-based and monitored feeding trials required to satisfy objective two. The research conducted at the targeted non-MPP food processing operations is expected to show that the use of PFC is both practical and cost effective. In addition, the follow-on livestock feeding trials are expected to show no significant negative impact to growth performance or feed efficiency from utilizing PFC-collected biosolids as part of a properly designed and nutrient-balanced feed ration. Finally, analysis of the bone and tissue samples from the feed test animals required to satisfy objective three is expected to show no significant uptake of any residual PFC chemical components that may be found in the test diets. This project is expected to show the use of PFC in the recovery of nutrient-rich biosolids from processing/waste water generated at non-MPP food processing facilities can be cost effective and will produce low cost and/or cost competitive unadulterated feed ingredients usable in livestock feeding programs. Finally, a byproduct of the successful diversion of valuable nutrients from waste disposal to a value-added use is the environmental benefit of eliminating or reducing a significant and costly waste stream.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): More than 4.5 million Americans currently suffer from Alzheimer's Disease, a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by loss of memory, changes in personality, agitation, disorientation, loss of coordination, and finally, total loss of day-to-day functioning. Alzheimer's is a staggeringly expensive disease, costing the American economy more than  83.9 billion annually. The Alzheimer's Association estimates that by 2050 between 11.3 million and 16 million Americans will be Alzheimer's victims, and that the overall economic impact of the disease will increase four-fold. Much of the cost of Alzheimer's is born by Medicare and Medicaid. There is currently no treatment that halts the overall progression of the disease. As such, there is a great need for a significant breakthrough in Alzheimer's prevention and treatment. There is a growing consensus that Alzheimer's is a multifactorial disease and it is possible that a  cocktail  of medicines or ingredients may be needed to successfully delay its onset or progression. The Akeso Health Sciences (Akeso) medical food cocktail is composed of standardized herbal extracts, vitamins, and minerals that are demonstrated in the basic science and clinical medical literature to impact the biochemical and pathophysiological processes involved in Alzheimer's Disease. During Phase I of this SBIR project, the investigators formulated the cocktail and conducted initial feasibility tests on cognitive function in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's Disease. The medical food cocktail was effective in preventing cognitive decline and reducing Alzheimer's-related neuropathology compared to transgenic mice on regular mouse chow only. Normal non-transgenic mice fed the cocktail exhibited improved cognitive function. For Phase II of this SBIR project, the investigators propose to test the efficacy of the cocktail in improving cognitive function in several animal models of Alzheimer's Disease that exhibit more advanced Alzheimer's-related neuropatholgies and severe neuronal loss. The cocktail will be tested in 2 additional transgenic mouse models and in a longitudinal study in an aged canine model. If such a medical food cocktail proves feasible and cost effective for use as a complementary or alternative therapy for Alzheimer's Disease, the devastating economical and societal costs of Alzheimer's may be drastically reduced. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Building on the results of a successful Phase I SBIR project, the investigators propose to test the efficacy of a medical food cocktail consisting of standardized herbal extracts, vitamins, and minerals in improving cognitive function in several animal models of Alzheimer's Disease.

Current tissue expanders either require external inflation or are immediately swelling potentially re-opening the surgical implant site. Also, no current tissue expander is re-shapable, reducing their usefulness. Phase I research showed that hydrogels could be generated which had the desirable properties of reshapability, 2-3 weeks of the lag time prior to expansion, and post-degradation high mechanical strength. These properties could also be controlled by changing chemical composition of the hydrogels. Phase II research will focus on combining these desired properties into a few optimized prototypes and subsequently testing of these prototypes for safety and efficacy in animal models to generate tissue expanders ready for clinical trials. Specific Aim 1 is to synthesize more delayed swelling hydrogels each possessing three requirements ideal for tissue expanders. Akina has already identified one hydrogel prototype with desired properties. Six optimized prototypes will be selected to carry forward to the next stages. Specific Aim 2 is to examine the efficacy of selected tissue expanders in the rat model. This will screen the six prototypes down to the one which is most effective as a tissue expander. Specific Aim 3 is to examine the toxicity of the tissue expander identified in Aim 2 and test its efficacy in the dog model. Safety of this prototype will be determined using ISO 10993 testing to ensure the hydrogels are non-toxic and biocompatible. An intra-oral dog model will be utilized to determine the efficacy of the hydrogel prototype in a setting representative of dental use. Specific Aim 4 is to produce a delayed swelling tissue expander ready for clinical studies. The hydrogel prototype that has been shown to be safe and effective in the animal studies will be used to prepare application to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for approval of clinical studies. Successful completion of this Phase II study will generate novel, delayed-swelling, hydrogel based, tissue expanders which do not suffer the drawbacks of current tissue expansion technologies. These tissue expanders will be easily re-shapable, have delayed expansion, have good post-degradation strength, and be shown to be safe and effective in animal models. Akina's delayed swelling tissue expander will provide substantial advantages over the current tissue expander on the market, and thus immediate impact to the field is expected. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This Phase II SBIR project will generate re-shapable, delayed-expansion, hydrogel-based tissue expanders for use in dental and other reconstructive surgeries. These tissue expanders will overcome problems associated with current technology, such as eliminating exterior equipment and allowing custom fitting of the expander to the tissue by the surgeon. This technology will reduce the incidence of morbidity associated with this surgery, thus promoting general public health.",

Several drugs are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating influenza infections, but successful treatment depends on knowing the specific antigenic subtype and administering these drugs within the first 48 h of illness. Recent outbreaks of avian influenza H5N1 in East Asia have fueled concern over another pandemic and emphasize the need for comprehensive strain sub-typing in surveillance and diagnostic applications. The objective of this Phase 2 Project is therefore to develop and field test a sample-to-answer RT-PCR array kit for influenza detection and antigenic sub-typing in diagnostic and surveillance settings, with an emphasis on simple, low-cost microarray technology that can be deployed and used in peripheral hospital labs. The performance goal is a sample-to answer result in 2 hours or less at an input target concentration of 102 viral particles per mL nasopharyngeal swab. Early adopters at Wadsworth Center, Columbia University, Little Company of Mary Hospital and the CDC will assist in the pre-clinical verification of the technology on amended and blind clinical samples.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To address the urgent need for better treatment and diagnostic testing of HIV infected people in resource-limited settings, we propose in this Phase II SBIR to further develop an electrochemical testing system (eSystem) developed by Alderon Biosciences, Inc. for determinations of HIV viral load in clinical samples. Alderon's long-term goal is to produce, validate, and gain FDA approval for a facile and affordable (lt  10) HIV viral load test, sensitive to below 500 copies/ml, that gives same-day results using an inexpensive and portable instrument. Currently available FDA-approved HIV viral load tests require expensive instrumentation, utilize complex molecular biology procedures, and can cost gt  100 per test. Our hypothesis is that Alderon can develop a far more facile and affordable system for accurate viral load measurements and drug susceptibility testing that will enable viral load testing to be done in resource-limited point-of-care (POC) environments. The innovation in the new HIV viral load tests proposed by Alderon lies in the use of advanced electrochemical detection methods for quantifying the activity of reverse transcriptase (RT) in clinical samples. The viral RT enzyme plays an essential role in viral replication, regardless of HIV subtype. Because the enzyme's presence is highly correlated with that of the viral RNA, RT activity assays are a recognized (but not FDA-approved) alternative method for monitoring viral load. Unlike PCR-based assays that have problems quantifying the often-changing RNAs of some HIV subtypes, RT activity tests work equally well for HIV-1 (regardless of subtype) and HIV-2, can be done without highly skilled technicians, and are less subject to problems of contamination. Alderon's Phase I work has shown feasibility of an electrochemical approach to quantification of viral RT activity, with the potential for greatly improved performance (time and cost per test) relative to optical assays. Alderon's proposed 3 year Phase II SBIR project has 4 Specific Aims that will lead to eSystem improvements and accurate detection of HIV load in facile and low-cost same-day tests. Aims 1 and 2 focus on improvements in the instrument and sensors that will make the viral load assays more affordable and simpler for use in resource-limited settings. Aim 3 improvements of reagents and assay protocols will further reduce assay time and complexity. Aim 4 validation of eSystem performance in viral load tests with a wide range of samples will set the stage for FDA approval and product commercialization. Collaborative work with the UNC Center for AIDS Research will establish the correlation between results of eSystem assays and viral load results obtained by alternative FDA- approved methods. Product commercialization will be facilitated by collaborative work with Magellan Biosciences, whose engineering expertise will aid in the development of reliable and robust instruments and viral load test kit components that can be produced in facilities certified for good manufacturing practices. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: An estimated 33.2 million people are now living with HIV disease worldwide and in 2007 it claimed the lives 2.1 million people, including 330,000 children (World Health Organization). To address the urgent need for better treatment and diagnostic testing of HIV infected people, Alderon Biosciences, Inc. proposes to further develop a low-cost and easy-to-use electrochemical testing system (eSystem) for determinations of HIV viral load in clinical samples. Alderon's approach will make it possible to perform viral load testing in primary care or point-of-care (POC) environments and aid in monitoring and treating HIV positive patients in resource-limited environments.",

        "abstract": "Current state-of-the-art X-ray imaging detectors use energy integration, where the simple integration of X-ray events during the exposure period forms images.  Unfortunately, such indiscriminate operation is sub-optimal for digital radiography or CT imaging because of its inability to reject scatter, thus reducing contrast in reconstructed images, and the limited resolution of the detectors, which results in image blurring.  These deleterious effects are particularly problematic for high-energy X-ray inspection systems for munitions, where important small-scale defects on the order of 100 to 250 microns are easily obscured due to the prevalent scattering.  However, a new generation of X-ray detector to be developed during Phase II is expected to have photon counting and energy recording ability, even when incident flux is very high.  The use of such detectors will improve resolution and contrast in images, while significantly enhancing their signal-to-noise ratio, and assist in identifying material compositions.  Our Phase I research successfully demonstrated the feasibility of developing such a detector based on a semiconductor X-ray sensor coupled to a novel digital pixel sensor readout.  For X-ray energies typically used in inspection systems, this detector would provide high efficiency, high resolution, and photon counting capability with at least five levels of energy discrimination.",

These items tend to account for a significant amount of the cost per detector channel, which limits the size of the experiment and the number of detector channels.  A novel method for signal digitization is required to reduce these costs.  This project will investigate the use of a CMOS solid-state photomultiplier (SSPM), integrated with an on-chip ADC, as a cost effective method for digitizing the photodetector signal.  Phase I showed that a detector designed with large-area solid-state photomultiplier can provide energy resolution equivalent to that of a traditional photomultiplier tube, but at a fraction of the cost.  Phase II will develop a large area (~1 cm x 1 cm) device with on-chip signal processing and integrated digitization.  The work will provide the required schematics, processes, and mask sets for full production of these devices, so that they can be implemented for nuclear physics experiments. Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  These devices should find use in a variety of experiments as a viable alternative to the traditional method for scintillator readout.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High Resolution Detectors for Single Photon Cardiac Imaging Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is a powerful, noninvasive medical imaging modality that mathematically reconstructs the three dimensional distribution of a radionuclide throughout the body of a human patient or a research animal. Typically, the collected data are displayed and evaluated as a set of two-dimensional images through the organ or diseased area under investigation. SPECT allows quantitative study of the function in the investigated region and therefore is an extremely useful tool for understanding organ and tissue physiology including that in the heart. SPECT is very commonly used in identifying as well as localizing coronary artery disease and as many as 90% of all myocardial perfusion studies are now performed using SPECT. Thus, SPECT is playing a critical role in cardiac imaging, providing both diagnosis as well as prognosis. However, there is urgent need for improvement in the instrumentation that is currently used for this imaging modality and expand its capabilities in order to exploit its full potential. At present, the performance of SPECT systems often is limited by the detectors used in these systems. Modern SPECT systems consist of scintillation crystals coupled to photomultiplier tubes as detectors. Important requirements for scintillators used in SPECT applications include high light output and high energy resolution, reasonably fast response and high gamma ray stopping efficiency. Ideally, the scintillator should also be inexpensive, rugged and easy to manufacture. Currently, NaI(Tl) is the detector of choice in SPECT systems and it is relatively inexpensive and its light output is fairly large. However, the poor energy resolution of NaI(Tl) often limits SPECT performance. The energy resolution of NaI:Tl is limited by its relatively poor proportionality. If scintillators with higher energy resolution at typical SPECT energies (~140 keV) were available, the essential process of scatter rejection would improve. Furthermore, dual-isotope imaging, which is a unique property of SPECT, would also become possible if scintillators with high energy resolution became available. The goal of the proposed effort is to investigate a new high resolution detector for SPECT studies. Enhanced scatter rejection can be expected along with possibility of dual isotope imaging. The Phase I project will be aimed at demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed concept, while the Phase II project will be aimed at optimization of the new detector, implementation of the prototype module and detailed performance evaluation.",

Unfortunately, however, the current state of the art area detector technology has significant performance limitations in terms of sensitivity, position resolution, and count rate capability, logistic complications, or non-real-time output. Relatively new digital readout technologies have potential to overcome many of these limitations, but unfortunately they are limited by the current neutron-sensitive scintillator technology. Current scintillators are associated with a tradeoff between detection efficiency and spatial resolution; have low discrimination between neutron and 3-ray events, and are slow in response. The development of new scintillators that overcome these difficulties and provide enhanced signal-to-noise ratios will result in improved detectors that will play a vital role in the effective utilization of neutron sources to facilitate important discoveries. We propose to address limitations of the current neutron scintillator technology by developing a large area, low cost, structured scintillator that can simultaneously provide very high spatial resolution, high detection efficiency, low sensitivity to gamma radiation, and fast temporal response. Furthermore, structured nature of the proposed scintillator will minimize lateral spread of scintillation light, thereby providing images with superior contrast. The novel scintillator thus developed will be integrated into the current digital readouts to demonstrate fabrication of detectors that will fulfill the demanding needs of the current and planned experiments at various institutions around the globe by conducting tests at such national laboratories as ORNL and NIST. The commercialization efforts will be undertaken in collaboration with an industrial partner who has well established production capabilities and marketing groups around the globe. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Neutron radiography and diffraction are used in many important medical and non-medical imaging applications, yet its full potential is far from realized today because of the lack of suitable high-performance sensors and detectors. The proposed high spatial resolution structured scintillator, when used in conjunction with a high-resolution photodetector or other readout, will result in a high-performance neutron detector with very low gamma-ray sensitivity. The novel scintillator proposed here will advance the state of the art in neutron imaging for such important applications as determining the structure and function of proteins, and for the discovery of biological processes taking place on a sub-molecular level, the knowledge of which is necessary for the development of advanced drugs and treatments for cancer, AIDS, heart disease and other serious illnesses. Additionally, novel detectors based on the proposed neutron sensor will be of critical importance for our national security, for threat detection and reduction, and in the areas of advanced materials research. A detector based on the proposed scintillator will significantly enhance the sensitivity, image quality and usefulness of neutron imaging systems, while reducing their cost.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent extraordinary developments in synchrotron radiation sources have enabled the growth of powerful research techniques such as time-resolved X-ray diffraction studies, essential for understanding dynamic biological phenomena and recovering phase information in X-ray crystallography. To make the most effective use of these advanced synchrotron sources for important protein studies, however, new, efficient, high-throughput detectors are needed. Such detectors will enhance the quality of the molecular models that are the end product of the macromolecular crystallography process. Toward achieving this goal, several novel readouts based on new designs of charge-coupled devices have been developed. However, current X-ray-to- light converters provide low light conversion efficiency, low X-ray absorption, and a tradeoff between spatial resolution and efficiency, and significantly limit the performance of these powerful new CCD devices. To address these issues, we propose to develop a novel semiconductor scintillator that promises to produce as much as a three-fold increase in light yield over the known brightest scintillators, high X-ray absorption due to its high density and high effective atomic number, a fast decay without any afterglow, emission in the wavelength range that is most suitable for CCD-type devices, and orders of magnitude higher radiation resistance than current scintillators. Beyond the excellent scintillation properties of this new and advanced scintillator, it will be fabricated in a microcolumnar form, which will provide very high spatial resolution. When combined with a suitable readout, this scintillator will enable realization of the high speed, large area, high resolution detectors needed for important time-resolved X-ray diffraction and other studies. During Phase I we successfully accomplished each of our stated goals and demonstrated the feasibility of our new scintillator technology. Building upon this foundation, the goal of the Phase II research is to further develop the technology to grow microcolumnar films capable of providing an as-yet unattained combination of very bright signal, negligible afterglow, high spatial resolution (in excess of 20 lp/mm), and excellent temporal resolution, all of which are necessary for time-resolved X-ray diffraction studies in particular, and for high speed X-ray imaging and digital radiography in general. Our Phase II scintillators are expected to measure 25 x 25 cm2 or larger in area, with efficiency in excess of 98% for X-ray energies typically used in time-resolved studies, and at least 3 orders of magnitude higher radiation resistance compared to current state-of-the-art scintillator screens. After fabrication, the films will be characterized in detail in terms of their morphology, scintillation properties, optical properties and imaging performance at RMD. Films will then be integrated into a specially developed high-speed readout by RMD and evaluated at the BioCAT beam line at the Advanced Photon Source (APS) at ANL, to demonstrate their performance superiority compared to current state-of-the- art scintillator screens. Applications of a scintillator with the exceptional properties described range widely - from macromolecular crystallography to medical imaging, and from nondestructive testing to polymer research. As such, the commercial potential for this sensor is particularly high. We and our collaborators at the APS and our potential commercial partners believe that due to its extraordinary properties, this scintillator will have widespread use in many important synchrotron-based applications. During the proposed Phase II research, we will undertake efforts to successfully develop and market these screens through our own resources and in collaboration with our commercial partners. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will develop and evaluate a unique scintillator that will provide a factor of three higher light than the brightest commercial scintillators, emission in the red region of the spectrum, high density and high effective atomic number, fast decay time with no afterglow, and orders of magnitude higher radiation resistance compared to the best current scintillators. The availability of such a sensor will enable advancements in the high speed X-ray imaging detector technology needed for many critically important biological studies, such as static and time-resolved scattering from macromolecules. In turn, this will facilitate addressing the important  protein folding problem  and the study of phase transitions in model membrane systems, the understanding of which is vital for many biotechnological applications, such as the design of various drug delivery systems.",

        "abstract": "The next generation of silicon-based detectors for tracking charged-particles in high energy physics experiments will impose demanding requirements.  One of these requirements involves the need for thermally efficient, low mass, dimensionally-stable support structures exposed to high radiation fields.  This project will develop specially processed carbon foam for use in sandwich structures that support silicon-based detectors.  The approach will be based on a thermally enhanced, very-low-density carbon foam material, ideally suited for transporting electronic heat to an embedded cooling tube in the structural sandwich member.  In Phase I, test articles, with a 600 fold increase in thermal conductivity over virgin foam, were produced and tested.  Cooling tests, with pre- and post- temperature cycling, demonstrated good results, and no failure of the foam was observed.  In Phase II, the thermal resistance in high flux regions will be lowered by adding high conductivity fibers that are uniquely oriented to enhance joint thermal and structural properties.  Performance enhancements will be evaluated using representative sandwich structures with the thermally enhanced foam cores.  Extensive thermal cycling tests will be conducted to verify joint integrity.Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The carbon foam should find use as a replacement for honeycomb core materials in physics detectors where lightweight thermally conductivity is needed.  In addition, the carbon foam technology could have applicability to the core material for high temperature heat exchangers for military and commercial aircraft, replacing Inconel and Hastelloy X fins",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of this project is to develop a tumor-targeted TCR-IL2 fusion protein, ALT-801, as an immunotherapeutic for treatment of p53-positive cancers. The TCR portion of this fusion protein is specific for a peptide derived from the tumor-associated protein p53 presented in the context of HLA- A2.1. This high-affinity TCR is designed to guide the approved anti-cancer drug, interleukin-2 (IL-2), to the tumor site to enhance the IL-2 anti-tumor activity and to minimize toxicity associated with IL-2 treatment. In a number of xenograft tumor models, ALT-801 inhibited the growth or caused regression of primary tumors derived from human p53+/HLA-2.1 cancer cells and exhibited significantly better anti- tumor activity than recombinant human IL-2 alone. Mechanism-of-action studies suggest that the fusion protein binds to immune cells and guides these cells to the tumor site where they mediate their anti- tumor activities. Based on these results, ALT-801 has been advanced as a clinical candidate for the treatment of cancer patients with locally advanced or metastatic p53-positive malignancies to evaluate the safety, immunogenicity, pharmacokinetic profile and to establish the maximum tolerated dose level (MTD). The fusion protein's ability to stimulate immune cells and anti-tumor activity was also measured. Patients have been enrolled in three different dose level cohorts and the MTD has been determined. ALT-801 is well tolerated at the MTD level. Data from the treated patients also indicate that ALT-801 has a substantial longer serum half-life (i.e. ~ 3.3 hr) than that of recombinant human IL-2 and achieves the corresponding targeted serum levels. ALT-801 treatment increases serum INF3 concentration without inducing TNF1 in the patients' sera and stimulates peripheral blood mononuclear cells, indicating immune cell activation that may play a role in antitumor responses. Tumor assessment showed stable disease in approximately 50% of the treated patients with tumor shrinkage observed in some patients. Based on these findings, advancement of ALT-801 into Phase II clinical testing is warranted. Under this proposal, a Phase IIa trial will be conducted to continue the evaluation of ALT-801's efficacy and safety in the target indications where tumor responses were observed in the Phase I trial. The following specific aims will be pursued: 1) generate sufficient ALT-801 clinical material to support Phase II human clinical studies, and 2) conduct a Phase IIa human clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ALT-801 in subjects with refractory metastatic melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, head and neck cancer and prostate cancer at the MTD dose level. Achievement of clinical endpoints proposed by this study will prompt an expansion of enrollment in the appropriate indications to provide data necessary for advancement of ALT-801 into pivotal clinical trials for FDA approval.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of the proposed research is to examine the safety and efficacy of a novel tumor-targeted immunotherapeutic in patients with refractory metastatic melanoma, renal cell carcinomas, head and neck cancer and prostate cancer. This is a second phase of a human trial of the immunotherapeutic which has shown to provide clinical benefits for patients having these cancers. This may lead to a safe and effective approach to treat patients with refractory, metastatic cancer.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A key rationale of this project is the growing need for an improved low-cost, high sensitivity multigene mutation profiling method for tumors. An important example is the recent recommendation of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) to screen all patients diagnosed with metastatic colorectal cancer for KRAS mutations in the primary tumor or a site of metastasis. Mutations in KRAS and other genes downstream of EGFR have been found to be highly predictive of resistance to anti-EGFR therapies. A second example is the case of cancer recurrence, where mutations in several genes have been found to be highly correlated with metastatic relapse, although further research is still needed before the efficacy of particular multigene mutation panels are established. In general, a lower-cost, higher sensitivity method than conventional DNA sequencing capable of scanning for mutation in multiple genes from tumors including from FFPE blocks is needed to improve current CRC tumor screening and accelerate the development of new screening assays. During Phase I, a new method based on mass spectrometry of in vitro expressed proteins (MASSIVE-PRO) was developed for such a purpose. Initial studies demonstrated that as low as 1- 2% mutant population could be detected in three test genes: APC, KRAS and P53. Since MASSIVE-PRO is a scanning technique, only the WT sequence of a gene needs to be known in order to discover a new mutation which is added to the gene signature. During Phase II, research will focus on the improvement of MASSIVE-PRO and its application to molecular profiling of CRC tissue with particular focus on developing an assay to more accurately predict mCRC patient's resistance to anti-EGFR drugs. Advanced techniques for cell-free protein expression and mass spectrometry will be introduced to significantly improve the ability to detect and characterize mutations including the use of reconstituted extracts, primer design, MS-MS sequencing, isotope depletion, multiplex processing and detection and automation. We will obtain and analyze 200 tumor samples stored as FFPE blocks from CRC tissue archives along with correlated patient history in collaboration with Dr. Paul Schroy, Director of Clinical Research for the Section of Gastroenterology at the Boston Medical Center and Dr. Brent Zanke, Vice-President of the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research Tumor Bank. Choice of target genes and regions scanned is based on recent studies showing that mutations in KRAS, BRAF, PTEN and PIK3 result in resistance to anti-EGFR drug therapy. For the purpose of ultimate clinical implementation, regulatory (FDA) approval, and marketing of a molecular profiling assay based on MASSIVE-PRO AmberGen will work closely with both Genzyme Corporation and Quest Diagnostics, Inc., two of the largest diagnostic companies in the U.S. All results will be statistically analyzed in collaboration with Prof. Josie Dupuis, Associate Professor of Biostatistics at Boston University School of Public Health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There exists an increasing need to develop a low-cost, high sensitivity method for scanning for mutations in the DNA from tumors. In the case of colorectal cancer, one example is the need to identify those patients who are resistant to anti-EGFR drugs. Current methods for mutation detection, such as conventional DNA sequencing are not sufficiently sensitive to be used routinely in clinical practice. This project aims to develop a novel low-cost, high-throughput method for profiling CRC tumors based on cell-free protein translation and mass spectrometry, which if successful will reduce the high mortality rate of the over 150,000 U.S. citizens diagnosed each year with CRC.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of this project is to develop a comprehensive molecular diagnostic assay for the detection of clinically relevant genetic abnormalities in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), and myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs). An estimated 44,000 new leukemia cases were predicted for 2008, with more than 21,000 deaths. Leukemia and MPDs are a group of similar diseases of the immune system that have different symptoms, treatment targets, and prognoses. Risk stratification for these diseases has shifted from morphology and cytogenetic analysis to molecular markers. The variation in clinical outcome based on disease subtype underscores the very real need to ascertain for each individual patient the combined cytogenetic and mutational events that underlie the disease; thus, these markers are used as an aid in diagnosis. Furthermore, the products of these cytogenetic and mutational alterations are being exploited as molecular targets for novel therapies. Thus, these treatments will require companion diagnostics for comprehensive detection of molecular signatures that are predictive of treatment outcome. During Phase I we established the feasibility of detecting a small set of mutations with clinical relevance to leukemias and MPDs by demonstrating specific detection of a small set of mutations using a multiplex bead array system. Furthermore, we demonstrated simultaneous detection of mutations and translocations in a single-tube assay format. This resulted in the launch of an RUO diagnostic kit for the detection of NPM1 mutations (Signature(R) NPM1 Mutations). The primary goal of this Phase II grant is to expand the assay into a comprehensive system for simultaneous detection of a suite of sequence-level mutations and cytogenetic abnormalities. In addition to expanding the availability of molecular assays for leukemia/MPD testing, our single-tube, bead array format will simplify adoption into diagnostic laboratories in a manner that reduces overall assay time, operator hands-on time, and training time and provides a software interface that simplifies reporting and facilitates reimbursement. We will develop a set of synthetic controls as well as a software interface for test selection and reporting and perform stability testing and other assay performance experiments. We will also work with clinical collaborators to evaluate the test in a diagnostic laboratory setting on clinical patient samples. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this Phase II SBIR project is to develop a reliable and cost-effective diagnostic test kit for mutations found in leukemia patients. Detection of mutations using our test will allow physicians and patients to choose the most effective treatment for each individual patient while improving efficiency and driving down costs in the molecular diagnostic laboratory.",

Microarrays have found widespread use in biology and medicine as important tools for evaluating gene expression and genomics. Using these tools, clinical researchers are driving the characterization of the molecular signatures of disease as they relate to both prognosis and therapy. By resolving the detection of complex analyte mixtures, microarray technology offers tremendous promise to improve patient care in situations in which clinical decisions must be informed by classifiers based on inputs from large sets of features. Broader implementation of diagnostic microarrays will require the development and manufacture of enabling technologies that are robust and reproducible and can be performed reliably and efficiently in the clinical diagnostic laboratory setting. Rigorous control of design and manufacturing processes of these products is essential to achieving inter-lot, inter-laboratory consistency and obtaining regulatory approval and reimbursement. The solutions to these issues should enable much more widespread implementation of diagnostic microarrays and the corresponding advances in human healthcare that are promised by molecular diagnostics.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The long-range goal of this project is to restore functional movement to low-functioning stroke patients using a novel therapeutic regimen and robotic device called  AMES,  an acronym for Assisted Movement with Enhanced Sensation. In AMES-as it is currently used-the patient's affected limb is moved cyclically with the AMES robotic device while the sensation of motion is enhanced by an AMES muscle vibrator applied to the antagonist muscle(s). The patient simultaneously assists with the imposed movement using biofeedback of voluntary joint torque. In a Phase I clinical trial (Cordo 2008), AMES was determined to be effective at restoring functional movement in both upper and lower extremities of low-functioning chronic stroke subjects (gt1 yr post-stroke), several of which were plegic. At enrollment, most of these subjects had no more than 30% of normal strength in the affected arm or leg. Despite this success at treating these highly disabled stroke subjects, AMES treatment usually did not restore functional movement at the fingers, wrist, or ankle if the joint was plegic. EMG recordings were taken of these subjects during AMES therapy, and all retained the ability to activate voluntarily their 'plegic' muscles. However, because this muscle activity was so weak, and because it competed with antagonistic co-contraction, these individuals were unable to counteract the opposing forces in order to move the joint. The goal of this proposed project is to incorporate EMG biofeedback into the AMES device and regimen for plegic stroke patients, as an alternative to joint torque biofeedback when no joint torque can be produced. Phase I of this project focused on eliminating electrical and mechanical noise in EMG recordings caused by the tendon vibrators, and on prototyping software to test the feasibility of combining the AMES regimen with EMG biofeedback. The goal of Phase II is to further develop the hardware and software associated with EMG biofeedback and muscle vibration, and to test the efficacy of AMES with EMG biofeedback on stroke patients with hand extensor plegia. There are 3 specific aims proposed in this Phase II application. Specific Aim 1 is to develop further the presentation of EMG biofeedback on the AMES device by designing and integrating a 2-channel EMG amplifier into the device and making the biofeedback more engaging to patients. Specific Aim 2 is to develop new, more reliable and user-friendly technology for muscle vibration, including the vibrator itself and its positioning mechanism. Specific Aim 3 is to test the efficacy of AMES with EMG biofeedback at 3 sites (Emory University School of Medicine, Oregon Health and Sciences University, and the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago) in a randomized, controlled clinical study of 64 chronic plegic stroke patients. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project addresses a sub-group of chronic stroke patients with hand plegia in extension, but who retain some ability to activate voluntarily the 'plegic' muscles. Our earlier studies suggest that as many as a third of the approximately 4 million stroke victims in the US with chronic motor disabilities have hand and/or foot plegia. The proposed technology is designed to reverse co-contraction at plegic joints and to restore functional movement. This Phase II project will test the efficacy of using biofeedback to retrain muscles in conjunction with a new therapeutic regimen called  AMES,  and to bring the AMES therapy device to the threshold of commercialization.",

In Phase II we will install RHHP in several hospital Intensive Care Units, where we will combine the hospital's census and RHHP's hand hygiene events to calculate hand hygiene events per patient per day, the standard measure of hand hygiene compliance. We will also measure the hospital acquired infection (HAI) rate. We will compare the hand hygiene compliance and the HAI rate in a baseline phase, when no voice messages play, to those rates in an intervention phase, when voice messages play. We will demonstrate that not only does hand hygiene increase in the intervention phase, but that the hospital acquired infection rate decreases as well. The result will be significant savings in lives and financial costs to the hospital. Further, RHHP reduces HAIs without using antibiotics, so it contributes to public health by minimizing the development of antibiotic-resistant organisms. We will optimize RHHP's hardware, software, phase lengths and message delivery parameters in Phase II, and investigate several research topics that can only be considered with the help of RHHP's detailed hand hygiene compliance measurements. At the same time, our collaborator Renoir Group will help us offer a simple version of RHHP for sale to customers convinced of its value by our Phase I results. In Phase III our collaborator A.C.C. Systems, Inc. will help us manufacture and market a more sophisticated RHHP to hospital chains. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Random Hand Hygiene Prompts will reduce the hospital acquired infection rate in hospitals where its voice messages play. As a result, fewer hospital patients will be colonized with infections on discharge and fewer infections will arise in the general public. Random Hand Hygiene Prompts will also reduce hospitals dependence on antibiotics. Then fewer strains of antibiotic-resistant bacteria will emerge, making it possible to treat more infections in the public with antibiotics",

Careless or malicious tampering with these networks could disrupt the network, invalidate data, and otherwise ruin experiments supported by the networks.  Security measures \u00bf fire walls, intrusion detection, etc. \u00bf used with regular networks are inadequate to protect these high-performance networks, which run at 10 Gbps to 40 Gbps.  Therefore, this project will develop robust, user-friendly security measures for both the control plane and the data plane, without sacrificing network speed, performance, or availability.  The approach will utilize a software security system that relies on a network of intelligent agents.  Phase I demonstrated the feasibility of using this system to protect control messages on a high performance network from cyber attack, with no loss of network speed, performance, or functionality.  In Phase II, the system will be implemented on the same hardware used by real-world high-performance networks.  Then, the system will be evaluated by an independent laboratory that will try to defeat the system. Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The control and data plane security system should be applicable to the high performance networks now being used in several key government agencies.  It is likely that these networks will become more widespread in the commercial environment as demand for high bandwidth increases",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetic and non-diabetic nephropathies and the Metabolic Syndrome are associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) - a program comprising proteinuria, accumulation of profibrotic collagen in the renal interstitium and relentless decline in renal function. CKD remains an unsolved challenge for the nephrologist, as it almost inevitably leads to end-stage renal disease, a life-threatening condition that necessitates renal replacement therapy. Currently approved therapies aimed at halting CKD are incompletely effective, evidenced by the dramatic and rising rates of requirement for renal replacement therapy. Scatter factor/hepatocyte growth factor (SF/HGF) is a renotrophic factor that is mitogenic for renal epithelial cells, exerts antifibrotic effects within the renal interstitium and stimulates renal repair. Clinical feasibility of SF/HGF administration is however limited by a number of logistical and financial issues relating to gene or protein therapy, especially in the setting of chronic diseases wherein orally bioavailable therapeutics are preferred. Using a drug-discovery engine comprising phage display, molecular modeling, rational drug design, targeted proteomics and preclinical biology, Angion Biomedica Corp. has identified BB3, an orally bioavailable small molecule SF/HGF mimetic. BB3 activates the SF/HGF receptor c-Met and recapitulates the bioactivities of SF/HGF in every assay tested to date. Similar to SF/HGF, BB3 downregulates the fibrotic program in activated astrocytes, hepatic stellate cells and renal fibroblasts. In preclinical models of dermal, pulmonary and hepatic fibrosis, BB3 is therapeutic, opposing profibrotic collagen deposition and preserving tissue microarchitecture. Our SBIR Phase I data indicate that orally administered BB3 is therapeutic in experimental CKD, attenuating mortality, limiting proteinuria and opposing renal interstitial collagen deposition. Additionally, data from a pilot study suggest that in a preclinical model of Metabolic Syndrome, oral administration of BB3 reduces proteinuria and attenuates renal interstitial collagen accumulation. From a drug development and regulatory perspective, a chronic (6- month), oral, escalating-dose, good laboratory practice safety study of BB3 in rat and dog is ongoing under the aegis of the NIH Rapid Access to Intervention Development program. Of significant clinical relevance, BB3 has successfully completed a Phase I acute safety clinical trial in healthy volunteers; a Phase IIA pharmacokinetics and tolerance study of BB3 in patients presenting with renal insufficiency is underway. The present SBIR Phase II application is designed to make a comprehensive and in-depth analysis of BB3 efficacy in preclinical models of CKD. Dose-dependence, dose schedule and therapeutic time window of BB3 will first be established in experimental CKD. Renal antifibrotic effects of BB3 will be evaluated together with standard-of-care and in models comprising co-morbid disease. Successful completion of the proposed work, together with the current clinical status of BB3, will enable us to enter this drug candidate into a safety and efficacy trial in CKD.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ischemic Stroke continues to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Currently approved thrombolytic therapy suffers for a narrow therapeutic window and clearly other therapeutic strategies are needed, such as neuroprotective or restorative agents. Unfortunately the quest for a therapeutic remains beset by a history of failed clinical trials involving promising neuroprotective candidates. Instead of targeting a single pathway in the cascade leading to ischemic neuronal damage, treatment with multifunctional compounds or supplements of endogenous multirole factors might be better choices for preventing ischemic brain injury. One of the most exciting areas of research for treatment of cerebral ischemia is the use of angiogenic growth factors, agents that exert direct neuroprotective effects and augment blood flow to the ischemic region. Scatter factor/hepatocyte growth factor (SF/HGF) neurotrophic, reduces cerebral infarct size, augments cerebral blood flow and promotes neuritogenesis and synaptogenesis, the growth of mature, functional neurons specifically in the per-infarct region or penumbra. These cellular effects lead to improved memory and learning in long term rodent studies even when HGF is given 7 days after the start of the ischemic insult. While administration of SF/HGF as gene or protein therapy has potential for the treatment of ischemic stroke, the therapeutic feasibility of this approach is limited by the presence of the blood-brain-barrier, and other issues such as immune and inflammatory responses evoked by adenovirus proteins, inherent instability of proteins in solution, their limited tissue half-life and cost-prohibitive production. We have identified Refanalin, an organic small-molecule SF/HGF mimetic that crosses the blood brain barrier , exerts neuroprotective effects (even when administered in a delayed setting) and augments psot ischemic blood flow in rat models of temporary and permanent mid-cerebral artery occlusion, tMCAO and pMCAO, respectively. This research effort is a collaborative agreement between Angion Biomedica Corp. and Dr. David Warner of Duke University to rigorously and independently test the dose, therapeutic window, and therapeutic duration of Refanalin in short and long term rat models of tMCAO and pMCAO, and addressing gender differences and activity in aged animals. This aggressive research plan will meet most of the recommendations of the Stroke Therapy Academic Industry Roundtable (STAIR) of 1999, which still remains the standard for preclinical drug development for stroke neuroprotective and restorative drugs. With the anticipated, positive outcome for Refanalin in our studies, Angion will be prepared to complete preclinical development, including testing Refanalin in non-human primate models before approaching the FDA with an IND package. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Ischemic stroke is a major cause of death in the United States. Unfortunately attempts at finding new neuroprotective therapies have failed miserably in clinical trials. Refanalin, a small molecular weight mimetic of HGF has been shown to protect brain cells in animal models and may prove to be a novel therapy to treat ischemic stroke.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Emphysema is a major cause of death and disability and afflicts approximately 2 million people. The disease cost more than  2.5 billion in annual health care expenses and causes or contributes to the death of 100,000 people each year in the United States alone. The disease is characterized by destruction of the alveolar wall, permanent enlargement of the airspaces and loss of lung recoil capability. Currently approved treatment regimens merely offer symptomatic relief and do not reverse the disease. New effective treatment options are urgently needed, particularly those which reverse the course of disease. Recent studies suggest that hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), a pleiotropic cytokine, has multiple activities that lead to lung regeneration. Such activities include promotion of elastin synthesis, suppression of apoptosis, suppression of inflammation, induction of angiogenesis and stimulation of proliferation of lung epithelial and endothelial cells. HGF production in pulmonary fibroblasts of emphysema patients is known to be impaired. Using gene transfer, HGF has been shown to ameliorate emphysema in animal models, and it can in fact induce a reversal of emphysema in animals with established disease. Thus, experiments with HGF demonstrate the great potential for targeting the HGF signaling pathway for the treatment of emphysema. To overcome the drawbacks of protein- or gene-based HGF delivery in vivo, we have recently developed a small-molecule mimetic of HGF, BB3 (a.k.a. Refanalin). This agent recapitulates the full-range of bioactivities of HGF tested in vitro and in vivo. Refanalin is currently in clinical development for short term intravenous use in kidney transplant patients. It is also being studied as a potential therapeutic in other indications where tissue regeneration is thought to be of critical importance. We have previously found that induction of emphysema by porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE) administration in the rat can be suppressed by co-treatment with BB3. Importantly, we found that daily oral administration of BB3 can reverse established emphysema in the PPE-induced rat model. Additionally, we demonstrated efficacy of BB3 in the TSK1/+ mouse, another model of established emphysema. These results suggest the potential of BB3 as a therapeutic for emphysema with the exciting prospect of reversal of the disease. To further pursue BB3 as emphysema therapeutic, we propose to (1) characterize dose and time dependence of the in vivo efficacy of BB3 in the porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE)-induced rat model of established emphysema, as well as response biomarkers and molecular markers related to protection and regeneration of the lung. (2) Establish the optimal oral dosing regimen for efficacy of BB3 and test the in vivo efficacy of BB3 in the TSK1/+ mouse model and the TGF-(1-induced Balb/c mouse model, two genetically determined models for established emphysema and (3) Test the in vivo efficacy of BB3 in established cigarette smoke-induced emphysema in the mouse. By completing these three specific aims, we will collect important information about the efficacy of BB3 in a breadth of experimental models, in different species and with different genetic backgrounds and molecular stimuli contributing to the establishment of the disease. Furthermore, we'll evaluate molecular markers related to the efficacy of BB3 and to the mechanism of action to stimulate lung regeneration in established emphysema. These data will therefore provide a basis for potential further development of BB3 as a therapeutic for emphysema. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pulmonary emphysema is a major cause of death and disability that affects approximately 2 million people and costs more than  2.5 billion in annual health care expenses. It directly causes or contributes to the deaths of 100,000 people per year in the United States alone. The disease is characterized by destruction of the alveolar wall, permanent enlargement of the airspaces and loss of lung recoil capability. Currently approved treatment regimens merely offer symptomatic relief and do not reverse the disease. New effective treatment options are urgently needed, particularly those which reverse the disease. Angion Biomedica Corp. has identified BB3, a small molecule mimetic of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) with excellent drug-like properties. Like HGF, BB3 has the potential to stimulate regenerative processes in the lung and thus reverse established emphysema. With support of an SBIR Phase 1 grant, we have found that daily oral administration of BB3 can indeed reverse established emphysema in the PPE-induced rat model. Additionally, we demonstrated efficacy of BB3 in the TSK1/+ mouse, another model of established emphysema. These promising results show the potential of BB3 as a therapeutic for emphysema with the exciting prospect of reversal of the course of disease. The objective of this phase II SBIR application is to further pursue BB3 as potential emphysema therapeutic. By establishing the exposure levels required for efficacy and by testing efficacy of BB3 in a variety of preclinical models of established disease with different genetic backgrounds and different molecular stimuli contributing to the establishment of the disease, we anticipate to collect important information about the breadth of efficacy of BB3, the oral efficacy in emphysema models and potential response biomarkers. This will provide a basis for potential further development of BB3 as a therapeutic for emphysema.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke is leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the US. Research on the pathophysiological basis of stroke has produced new paradigms for prevention and treatment, but translation of these approaches into improved clinical outcomes has proved to be painfully slow. Preventive strategies focus primarily on reducing or controlling risk factors such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and lifestyle; in patients with severe stenosis, carotid endarterectomy may be indicated. Cerebral angioplasty is used investigationally, but the high restenosis rates observed following coronary angioplasty suggest this approach may pose unacceptable risk for many patients. Therapeutic strategies focus primarily on acute treatment to reduce injury in the ischemic penumbra, the region of reversibly damaged tissue surrounding an infarct. Thrombolytic therapy has been shown to improve perfusion to the ischemic penumbra, but it must be administered within three hours of the onset of infarction. However, new clinically useful agents must be efficacious when given at considerably longer intervals after the onset of ischemia as most stroke patients do not arrive for medical treatment but for several hours, much later than the short, efficacious window of other agents such as the thrombolytics. Targeting Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP-1) in the setting of ischemic stroke may provide therapeutic benefit over a long time window, as research studies have demonstrated that PARP-1 inhibition will protect the neurovasculature from the primary ischemic insult and also later when additional cells die as the result of the induced inflammatory response. In this proposed study we will investigate the acute and long-term effects of our lead compound, ANG-2864 in rat models of temporary and permanent ischemic stroke.

We have evaluated the effects of Refanalin/BB3 in preclinical models of ischemic stroke, hepatic, renal, pulmonary and myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury including models of hepatic, renal and lung transplantation. Treatment with Refanalin/BB3 was associated with reduced mortality, improved organ function and preservation of tissue microarchitecture. These efficacy data (not presented here) and the efficacy of BB3/Rf to attenuate spinal cord injury and ischemic stroke as described in the preliminary results section, coupled with an excellent safety profile and ideal drugability characteristic, makes Refanalin/BB3 an ideal candidate for evaluation in other indications where HGF has shown efficacy, such as ALS. During our phase I grant period we have successfully confirmed that Refanalin prolongs survival of a commonly used mouse model of ALS. In addition, immunohistochemical analysis confirms the exciting result that Refanalin does indeed mimic the activities ascribed to HGF in this setting. We are excited to further investigate the efficacy of refanalin, and have independent verification of activity in our collaborators laboratory, with detailed mechanism of action studies; as various neuorotrophic factors have failed in the clinic, likely due in part to the extreme difficulty of adequately delivering such macromolecular, polypeptides, which will not cross the blood-brain barrier, to the CNS. Refanalin/BB3 will not have such limitations.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recently HGF has demonstrated excellent efficacy in a mouse model of ALS.

In fact, deaths from complications of liver fibrosis/cirrhosis are expected to triple over the next decade as a result of the hepatitis C epidemic and the growing incidence of liver disease associated with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Currently available therapies, including antivirals, are largely ineffective in treating the underlying fibrosis, and in the majority of cases, liver transplantation is the only effective cure. Acute liver failure (ALF) is commonly associated with the alcohol-acetaminophen syndrome, its clinical course is unpredictable and polarizing, with death as the outcome in a large percentage of cases. Given the lack of specific therapy, organ transplantation is the only clinically effective strategy. Hepatic growth factor (HGF), as known as scatter factor (SF), has been shown to be efficacious in reducing both liver fibrosis (chronic) and acute liver failure (acute). The feasibility of SF/HGF as gene or protein therapy however is limited by issues relating to immune and inflammatory responses evoked by adenoviral proteins, inherent instability of proteins in solution, their limited tissue half-life and the exorbitant costs associated with such therapy.

BB3 duplicates the bioactivities of the native protein in every assay tested to date. Particularly, BB3 possesses cell protective, anti-fibrotic, and regenerative activities and shows efficacy in reducing liver fibrosis and acute liver injury. The overall objective of our program is to advance BB3 to the clinic as a first-in-class antifibrotic for liver fibrosis and cyto-protective agent for acute liver injury. From a clinical perspective, a Phase I acute safety trial of intravenously administered BB3 has been successfully completed in healthy volunteers and BB3 was found to be well tolerated. Absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination studies indicate that BB3 is eliminated via its conversion to metabolites, with the liver and kidneys being the primary routes of metabolite elimination. Prior to evaluating BB3 efficacy in any patient population, including patients presenting with liver fibrosis, it is necessary to evaluate BB3 PK and safety in renally and/or hepatically compromised patients.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Kidney transplantation is the most effective therapeutic modality for end-stage renal disease. Given the increasing demand for donor kidneys, more centers today are transplanting kidneys that were previously considered unsuitable. Extended donor kidneys include kidneys from non-heart-beating donors, aged donors, donors with mild-to-moderate hypertension, or kidneys subjected to prolonged cold ischemia and exhibiting increased ischemia-normothermic reperfusion injury and delayed graft function, therefore necessitating dialysis in the recipient. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), also known as scatter factor (CF), is a renotrophic growth factor that exerts tissue protective and tissue reparative effects. Several studies have demonstrated beneficial effects associated with HGF treatment in experimental models of renal ischemia-reperfusion injury and renal transplantation, suggesting that HGF administration represents a therapeutic strategy to reduce the incidence and/or duration of DGF. Unfortunate clinical application of gene or protein therapies, are limited by immune- mediated responses, cost-prohibitive production schemes and relatively short-half life of the protein in vivo. Small molecule mimetics of bioactive proteins that recapitulate the desirable activity of the full-length protein hold significant promise in overcoming these drawbacks of gene- or protein-based therapeutics. Funded by the NIH SBIR program, and using a product discovery engine comprising phage display, 3- dimensional molecular modeling, protein chemistry and preclinical biology, we have identified BB3, a small molecule HGF mimetic. BB3 activates the SF/HGF receptor, c-Met, and has recapitulated the bioactivity of HGF in every assay tested thus far. Our SBIR Phase I and II studies indicate that the BB3 exerts cytoprotective effects, mediated, in part, via increased nitric oxide production, upregulation of anti-oxidant defenses, and inactivation of pro-apoptotic proteins. In in vivo models of renal ischemia-reperfusion injury, treatment with BB3 attenuates renal cell death and improves renal function. Consistent with the delayed postischemic expression of the SF/HGF receptor c-Met, treatment with BB3 24 hr following renal ischemia- reperfusion improves urine output, attenuates renal dysfunction and reduces mortality. Importantly, in a canine model of renal ischemia-reperfusion injury (conducted independently by Dr. Martin Mangino, Virginia Commonwealth University), BB3 treatment 24 hr following renal ischemia-reperfusion improves renal function. From a clinical development perspective, a Phase I clinical trial evaluating acute safety of systemically administered BB3 in healthy volunteers has been completed; no dose-limiting toxicity was observed. In addition, a Phase Ib clinical trial evaluating pharmacokinetics and safety of BB3 in stable adult patients on chronic hemodialysis has also been completed. BB3 pharmacokinetics and metabolite profile in this cohort is no different than that observed in healthy volunteers and the drug is well-tolerated. Based on these results, the present SBIR Phase II competing renewal is designed to conduct a pilot Phase IIa study evaluating safety and efficacy of BB3 in patients who have undergone renal transplantation and subsequently presented with DGF defined by poor renal function requiring dialysis.

The developed technology can be immediately applied to fabrication of diffractive optics, volume phase holographic gratings, and phase retardation plates for wavelengths up to 1.9 \u00fd\u00fdm, as well as antireflection layers for wavelengths up to 8 \u00fd\u00fdm. In Phase II project the technology will be optimized and applied to fabrication of the prototype components of infrared diffractive optics operating at longer wavelengths, including the important wavelength of CO2 laser 10.6 \u00fd\u00fdm and windows of atmospheric transparency 3-5 and 8-12 \u00fd\u00fdm.  The developed photo-modification process is highly adaptable and creates a rich technology platform for fabrication of a broad range of products for a large variety of markets. Successful\nimplementation of this technology will result in a new generation of high efficiency relief-free infrared diffractive optics and sub-wavelength components, including diffraction gratings, beam splitters, beam shapers, semiconductor materials with artificial birefringence, phase retardation plates and wave plates. The relief-free components of infrared diffractive optics based on semiconductor materials are capable to withstand high light intensities and perform complicated light management functions. Another important application is the fabrication of highly stable anti-reflection (AR) layers on infrared semiconductor optics. The market for infrared diffractive optics includes defense and airspace industry, laser industry, spectral devices, sensors and detectors, night vision optics, industrial process control, material processing, cutting and welding, environmental monitoring, medical diagnostics and surgery.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A novel bioprocess platform, involving synthesis of peptide and protein biopharmaceutical products as fusions with a synthetic  anchor  protein in bacteria, and subsequent proteolytic cleavage, has been developed. The unique features of the system allow for the economical production of large quantities of simple linear peptides, as well as complex, multi-component peptides. Preliminary studies and cost projections suggest that peptides ranging from about 15 to 100 amino acids can be produced for a few dollars per gram, in contrast to chemical synthetic methods for which costs dramatically increase with the length of the peptide product. Another major advantage is the rapidity with which each product can be generated and the generic nature of the process for many peptide and protein products, facilitating scale-up. This novel, rapid, economical bioprocess platform for recombinant peptides and proteins can help meet production requirements, at all levels of production from research quantities to many kilograms, in the biopharmaceutical, vaccine, biodefense, and biomedical research industries. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A novel production platform is being developed and specifically tailored for the rapid, scaleable, and economical synthesis of large peptides and small proteins for which chemical synthesis and existing recombinant methods are not feasible. The technology addresses a significant unmet need for production of peptide product candidates in the 20-100 amino acid size range. There are numerous commercial applications for this technology in manufacturing of peptide therapeutics and vaccines, in conformational epitope discovery and production (for biodefense), and in biomedical research. The platform may even be cost efficient enough to help retain bio-manufacturing capacity in the US, despite the pressures of cheaper labor and operating costs elsewhere in the global economy. The platform also represents an environmentally friendly alternative to chemical peptide synthesis, which generates large volumes of organic waste.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In delimited populations, such as nursing homes, day care centers, prisons, hospitals, and cruise ships, serious outbreaks of illness generally produce small absolute numbers of disease incidence. Moreover, these groups are often more susceptible to disease than the general population (e.g. Garibaldi et al. 1981, Nimri 1994, March et al. 2000). Additionally, they can have broad effect on the general population, acting as disease reservoirs and leading to increased overall incidence. However, these limited populations cannot be monitored effectively using traditional statistical techniques due to the sparseness of observed incidence, even under epidemic scenarios. The temporal progression of outbreaks and the social-contact mediated dynamics within these smaller groups instead lend themselves directly to exact combinatorial methods. This project will formulate computational algorithms and develop convenient software that implements ten exact combinatorial statistical tests for real-time use by front-line and drop-in surveillance programs focusing on limited or fixed small populations. These tests include: (1) maximum number of cases, (2) linear discrete scan, (3) the visitors test, (4) range-scan, (5) longest run of empty cells, (6) empty cells, (7) variant max test, (8) extreme values, (9) binomial maximum, and (10) hypergeometric maximum. These tests will be formulated in terms of space-time units, in the sense of the Ederers-Myers-Mantel test, allowing generalizations that account for changes in population over time and across space, while maintaining exactness of the p-values. Although limited tables for a few of these tests have been published, no general algorithms have heretofore been described for any of these methods. During the Phase I project, feasibility was demonstrated by formulating computational algorithms for four of the ten tests, implementing them in software, and preliminarily studying their sensitivity and power for detecting outbreaks in real and simulated data. The performance of the new algorithms was compared to the results of applying a standard statistical technique that assumes large sample size. In Phase II, computational algorithms will be developed for the remaining exact statistics and all will be implemented in a user-friendly software package. The software will be modular in design, allowing for the incorporation of new methods as they are developed. More comprehensive sensitivity, specificity and time-to-detection analyses will be conducted using Monte Carlo methods to generate outbreak scenarios with alternate clustering mechanisms. The results will lead to guidance regarding which methods are best for detecting particular types of outbreaks. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop exact statistical methods and software for use by public health professionals to detect clusters of disease in temporal incidence data. Unlike traditional cluster detection methods, these exact methods are reliable when sample sizes are very small, or when background incidence rates are very low. They should therefore be useful in monitoring disease outbreaks, or other non-random patterns of events of health concern, amid sparse data associated with institutional settings such as nursing homes, schools, hospitals, prisons, cruise ships, or particular high-risk behavior groups.",

        "abstract": "Forest insect pests cause significant economic and ecological damage every year. Dramatically increased pest activity in recent years suggests that changing climate conditions will inflate the uncertainty associated with pest risk assessments. Advances in forest pest risk analysis methodology are needed to allow managers to better explore the consequences and value of alternative management scenarios and to facilitate improvements in the prioritization of threats to natural resources. Although tools are currently available for mapping the risk of pest activity according to landscape features, host distributions, and climate, most equate habitat suitability with risk. A necessary but underdeveloped way to improve risk assessments would incorporate information about population dynamics. We propose to develop the first software tool that will accept a wide range of GIS-based factors, including habitat suitability maps, and predict risk based on spatially explicit simulations of forest pest population dynamics. A key aspect of this tool will be feedback between the pest and its hosts, allowing forest structure (and therefore habitat suitability) to evolve dynamically over time. The software tool will generate maps representing the area and intensity of impact on hosts and graphs describing the uncertainty associated with model output. We will apply efficient, flexible algorithms for population growth and dispersal in complex landscapes that allow processes at different scales in time and space to contribute to pest activity. This technology will make available models of forest pest growth and spread that will be of immediate use to individuals and agencies involved in forest health. The software will allow estimates of future impact from native pests using standardized monitoring data. It will also facilitate estimates of the rate of spread of invasive species. The option of grid-based and metapopulation modeling will encourage model comparison and validation. At present, the greatest limitation in landscape modeling is the availability of accurate and detailed information on landscape structure. However, the number and quality of GIS databases is increasingly rapidly. FHTET, for example, has produced a series of highly detailed risk maps summarizing the habitat suitability of the entire nation?s forests for the pests of greatest concern. As data availability increases, techniques such as we propose to develop that apply population dynamic models in data-rich landscape contexts will give managers unprecedented capability to predict and manage forest pest risks.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Endoscopes used in urology for transurethral imaging and procedures have small diameters on the distal end for minimal invasiveness. The resolution of such endoscopes is relatively low. While larger, laparoscopic imaging tools now routinely offer high-definition image quality; the endoscopic images still typically contain nearly 100 times fewer pixels. Emerging fiber-free endoscopes with distal-end sensors still fall short of high-definition video by an order of magnitude. The proposed Super-Zoom Endoscope (SuZE) will dramatically increase the resolution of endoscopic imaging in urology, providing high definition imagery for natural, panoramic views with HD displays, less user fatigue, and improved recognition of anatomical landmarks and indications of disease. The optional stereo imaging capability of the SuZE endoscope will improve depth perception and allow for instruments reaching the site for examination or treatment faster and less invasively. The fast, dynamic electronically controlled location of high- resolution region of interest will serve applications of SuZE in robotic surgery. The primary application of SuZE is envisioned in indourology, including cystoscopy, ureteroscopy, lithotripsy, transurethral bladder tumor resection, bladder biopsies, fulguration, and radical prostatectomy. A broader range of applications is in gastrointestinal endoscopy, gynecologic endoscopy, arthroscopy, neuroendoscopy, ENT endoscopy, pulmonary endoscopy, and vascular endoscopy. The Phase I studies were very successful. They established feasibility of the fiberoptic endoscope with a dramatically higher imaging resolution, compared to the existing sate of the art, with the same cross-section (diameter) of the endoscope. The demonstrated resolution was 4X to 8X higher than the fiber-limited resolution of the imaging bundle. Phase I demonstrated the possibility to retrofit the SuZE design to existing commercial endoscopic cameras. The Phase II specific aims are 1) to design and build the prototype SuZE endoscopic camera; 2) to design and demonstrate the stereoscopic version of the endoscope - SuZE-S; 3) to implement advanced real-time image-processing algorithms in compact, portable dedicated hardware; 4) to demonstrate practical use of the SuZE endoscope in surgical skills lab tests and in cadaver tests. The result of the Phase II will be first-generation, functional preproduction prototype of the SuZE endoscope, tested in preclinical trials. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Endoscopes used in minimally invasive procedures of urology are small in size, which limits their imaging resolution. As a result, the image quality is significantly lower compared to laparoscopes and other imaging tools that now routinely offer high- resolution output. The overall goal of the proposed project is to develop a small endoscope for use in endourology with high definition image quality, dramatically higher than with existing technology.",

        "abstract": "Every year more than 12 million Americans enjoy fishing in our oceans and along our coasts. These saltwater anglers generate close to $30 billion in economic impact and support nearly 350,000 jobs nationwide. A large majority of these anglers prefer to use live bait; however, the supply of live bait is limited and inconsistent. This unmet demand and sporadic supply of live bait has created an excellent opportunity to introduce new aquaculture products to the market. Aquatic Innovations, LLC (AI) is working towards capturing this large and untapped market by introducing farm-raised baitfish. Culturing baitfish on a commercial scale will allow the establishment of a consistent, year round supply of healthy bait that is not affected by seasonal variation. Therefore introduction of farm-raised pinfish (Lagodon rhomboides) will quickly capture a considerable portion of this market due to its superior performance and ability to meet year round demand. In Phase I, AI demonstrated the feasibility of spawning pinfish in an artificial seawater hatchery using hormone injections. AI further demonstrated that larval pinfish could be fed a commercial diet and be acclimated to 4 part per thousand (ppt) well water at an early age. In Phase II, AI will begin commercial production and distribution of the pinfish. AI will concentrate on improving spawning and culturing techniques that were developed in Phase I during the first year of Phase II. The three main areas of concentration will be extending the spawning period with photothermal manipulation, fry first feeding (in the hatchery vs. in a pond), and delivery logistics. AI anticipates producing a significant number of pinfish with the fall of 2009 spawn but also realizes that modifications will need to be made throughout the process. The second year of Phase II production will employ the modifications and technologies that were developed in Year 1 of Phase II in full commercial production. AI has set a production goal of 300,000 pinfish for the first year after the completion of Phase II (spring 2012); however, AI expects to reach that goal in Year 2 of Phase II. Therefore AI will have a large number of pinfish ready for this $169 million market by the end of Phase II funding. Much of the necessary infrastructure is in place, as AI has reached strategic agreements with two commercial fish producers to improve the transition to production of farm-raised pinfish at a commercial scale.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cervical cancer is a global health problem that continues to result in over 250,000 deaths a year, with 80% occurring in developing countries. Early detection of cervical abnormalities using the Pap smear has proven successful in reducing the number of deaths in industrialized nations. The high death toll from cervical cancer that still persists in developing countries could be substantially decreased if appropriate screening methods for cervical neoplasia were available in low resource setting. Widespread introduction of HPV vaccines in developing countries is not possible to date, and it appears as generally accepted that vaccination and screening should be applied in concert. Infection with a high-risk type Human papillomavirus (HPV) is correlated with gt 99% of cervical cancers. More than 90% of HPV infections, however, are cleared by the body without clinical consequence. Hence, diagnostic tests that merely detect the presence of HPV may result in unnecessary treatment of cervical neoplasia. Accumulating data strongly suggests that expression of HPV E6 and E7 oncoproteins is required for initiation and maintenance of cervical epithelial cell transformation. Thus, the E6 protein is an attractive diagnostic marker because it is correlated with the cancerous phenotype. Under a SBIR Phase 1 Grant, Arbor Vita has, in collaboration with PATH, developed a prototype of a HPV-E6 based lateral flow diagnostic test for cervical pre-cancer and cancer. The test exploits the ability of high-risk (oncogenic) HPV E6 oncoproteins, but not low-risk E6 proteins, to bind cellular PDZ domains. A recombinant PDZ domain is used for E6 capture, and detection occurs via anti E6 antibodies. The current prototype can detect HPV16-E6 and HPV18-E6 from as little as 5,000 cervical cancer cells in the background of cervical swab samples, and feasibility has been demonstrated for the remaining 5 of the top 7 most prevalent oncogenic HPV types. Arbor Vita and PATH now propose the development of the  E6 lateral flow cervical cancer test  towards a commercial prototype. Specific Aims of our proposal are: (1) to generate a multiplex E6 lateral flow cervical cancer prototype test for multiplex detection of E6 protein from HPV types 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, 58; (2) to develop a commercial prototype that is aligned with medical practice of women's health care in the target markets; (3) to demonstrate pre-clinical validity of the commercial prototype; and (4) to develop the  E6 lateral flow cervical cancer test  towards manufacturing under GMP specifications. If successful, this diagnostic test will fill a critical need for a rapid, accurate and low cost diagnostic test that can be used at the point of care. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The high death toll from cervical cancer in developing countries could be reduced drastically if robust, simple to perform and cost effective screening methods were available. Under this application, Arbor Vita Corporation and PATH propose the development of a HPV-E6 oncoprotein based lateral flow cervical cancer rapid diagnostic test towards a commercial prototype that is ready for clinical trials and GMP manufacturing.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke is a major cause of morbidity in the United States, affecting over 600,000 people annually. The only therapeutics currently available for the treatment of stroke are thrombolytic agents such as tPA, which have limited efficacy and are inappropriate for many patients due to risk of hemorrhage. One promising alternative to thrombolytics has been a class of agents that block glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity by targeting the NMDA receptor. These drugs have worked well in animal models of stroke but have failed in clinical trials, most often due to the appearance of neurological or cardiovascular side effects at dosages lower than the efficacious range. In a Phase I research program, Arbor Vita has identified a class of inhibitors that act downstream of NMDA receptors termed PSD-95 antagonists. These inhibitors are effective in rodent models of focal ischemia without blocking the electrical or calcium channel functions of the NMDA receptor. Preclinical development of the lead PSD-95 inhibitor, the fusion peptide TatNR2B9c, demonstrated impressive central nervous system safety, an important benefit versus traditional NMDA receptor blockers. Moreover, the long term toxicity of TatNR2B9c was minimal. Acute cardiovascular side effects were present, however, at doses only slightly higher than those predicted to be effective in humans. These effects were caused by a portion of the fusion peptide required for cellular uptake, but not involved directly in PSD-95 blockade. The focus of this proposal is to modify this portion of the fusion peptide, to overcome the cardiovascular side effects without a loss in potency or efficacy. The resulting improved PSD- 95 inhibitor would then be developed by carrying out essential preclinical safety and efficacy studies leading towards subsequent clinical testing and eventual commercialization. The Specific Aims of the proposal are: 1) identify TatNR2B9c derivatives that are cell permeable and bind PSD-95 potently, but do not trigger cardiovascular side effects, 2) demonstrate efficacy of the most promising drugs in the rat permanent pial vessel occlusion (P3VO) model of stroke, 3) confirm the improved safety of the lead peptides by conducting a dog cardiovascular (CV) safety study, 4) characterize the neuroprotective efficacy of the lead peptides as guided by the STAIR (Stroke Academic Industry Roundtable) recommendations, and 5) conduct the complete battery of preclinical safety and toxicity studies required to file a successful Investigational New Drug Application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Completion of this research will lead to clinical development of a peptide therapeutic with the potential to revolutionize the treatment of stroke and thereby address a massive unmet medical need. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There are no approved drugs directed at protecting against the brain damage caused by stroke, only drugs which can help restore blood flow to the afflicted area. The present grant aims to improve and advance towards clinical testing drugs directed at a novel target identified by Arbor Vita that can be administered after a stroke occurs and greatly reduce the resulting brain damage.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abstract There are over 40 lysosomal storage disorders, and most of these diseases affect adversely the central nervous system (CNS). The mainstay of treatment is enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). However, ERT is not effective for the brain, because the enzymes do not cross the brain capillary wall, which forms the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in vivo. Without treatment of the CNS, the young patients are destined to progressive neurodegeneration and death. The limiting factor in the future treatment of these diseases is the transport of the enzyme across the BBB. Bypass of the BBB with direct injection into the brain is not effective, because only a small part of the brain is treated with a trans-cranial delivery system. Conversely, virtually all cells of the brain can be treated with a trans-vascular delivery system that enables the enzyme to cross the BBB following intravenous administration. A new approach to the BBB delivery of large molecules such as enzymes is the molecular Trojan horse technology. A bi-functional fusion protein is produced with genetic engineering, wherein the missing recombinant enzyme is fused to a BBB molecular Trojan horse. The latter is a genetically engineered protein that is able to cross the human BBB by receptor- mediated transcytosis on endogenous BBB peptide transport systems. Pre-clinical studies show that a large enzyme with a molecular weight gt100,000 Daltons, can be delivered to brain via transport across the BBB, following attachment to a BBB receptor-specific Trojan horse. The present work will produce a novel fusion gene encoding human iduronidase and a genetically engineered molecular Trojan horse, which will allow the production of the corresponding fusion protein, AGT-181. This new fusion protein will be a new treatment of the brain in Hurler's syndrome. The aims of this work are to manufacture bioreactor-generated AGT-181, perform the GLP pharmacology-toxicology of this new drug, examine the tissue cross reactivity of AGT-181, and to prepare and file an IND to the FDA for the treatment of the brain in Hurler's syndrome. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Project Narrative Lysosomal storage disorders are serious inborn errors of metabolism, and about 75% of the ~40 lysosomal storage disorders affect the brain. The mainstay of treatment is Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT). However, ERT is ineffective in the brain, because the enzymes do not cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The present work will produce a novel recombinant fusion protein that is able to both (a) bind a human BBB receptor to trigger transport into the brain, and (b) retain high lysosomal enzyme activity. This novel drug, designated AGT-181, will be new treatment for the brain in Hurler's syndrome.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Osteoporosis induced by aging as well as a side effect of certain drugs is a serious public health problem. The lack of adequate means for early detection of bone deterioration is the most critical issue in the problem of minimization of side effects of pharmaceutical treatment on skeletal system as well as in monitoring osteoporosis therapy in general. Bone UltraSonic Scanner (BUSS) is intended for the early detection and monitoring of osteoporosis based on the measurements of propagation characteristics of various modes of axial acoustic waves in long bones. Clinical testing confirmed BUSS's capability to discriminate between stages of bone atrophy, particularly the changes from normal to osteopenia. This early stage of bone deterioration is not distinguished by other current ultrasonic techniques but is particularly important in monitoring drug induced or metabolic accelerated bone loss. The innovations, which are implemented in BUSS and described in the issued and pending U.S. patents and in numerous publications of Artann, include: simultaneous use of various modes of acoustic waves generated in a wide frequency band, axial scanning mode of bone examination; and comprehensive analysis of waveforms of bulk, surface and guided ultrasonic waves propagating along the bone with varied proportion of spongy and compact components. Artann has established a number of strategic relationships that will provide engineering, clinical, regulatory, reimbursement, manufacturing and marketing support/expertise to accomplish the goals of the project. Our partners includes: Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, and Health Smart Medical Center, Philadelphia, PA, to conduct validation and normative clinical studies necessary for FDA application; Hogan and Hartson, LLP, the regulatory and reimbursement partners to provide direction in completing multiple clinical studies and FDA submissions; Scalable Solutions Group, a regulatory compliance company with the focus on design control needed to satisfy FDA and international standards; Intertek tol conduct verification and validation testing and hazard analysis; and Healthcare Investors, LLC that made a commitment to provide necessary financial and managerial resources to the commercialization of the BUSS technology complementing NIH support of the project. Accomplishing the objectives of the project will secure market introduction of the portable, easy to use and cost effective BUSS for the early stage osteoporosis detection, management of drug-induced bone deterioration, and monitoring of pharmaceutical treatment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Development of a method for monitoring of bone deterioration induced by aging as well as a side effect of various drugs will provide a substantial benefit to society by diagnosing at risk patients and intervening to prevent further bone loss, increased bone fragility and debilitating fracture. Osteoporosis is known to affect 44 million Americans resulting in 1.5 million fractures and an estimated  18 billion in costs each year. Effective use of the pharmaceutical armament to treat osteoporosis is substantially impaired by the lack of the diagnostic tools that could assess early stages of bone deterioration preceding gross changes in bone mineral content. Laboratory tests and clinical studies have shown that Bone Ultrasonic Scanner (BUSS) developed at Artann Laboratories is highly sensitive to early stages of bone loss and changes in bone structure. BUSS could be ideally suited for the monitoring bone deterioration and early identification of those at a risk for osteoporosis. The long-term goal of this project is to move the BUSS technology to market while also meeting a significant clinical and patient need.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): GeneticaLens, a multi-media video production and technology services company, has joined forces with a team of leading researchers in the early detection of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) to create the Autism Spectrum Disorders Risk Alert (ASDRA ). ASDRA  is a software system and integrated web based toolset with access to a video-intensive database, that facilitates the early assessment of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) by assisting pediatricians in following the complex American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommended guidelines for the surveillance of children three years of age and under. ASDRA  will be designed to be compatible with pediatric office EMR programs or work as a stand-alone application. At the end of Phase II ASDRA  will provide: a. A Pediatrician Parent Share Tool (PPST ) with an interactive, video- enhanced assessment tool (the IMCHAT), as well tracking devices and reminder/alert features. b. A 2-part CME course and tests to train healthcare providers on the early risk alerts of ASD as well as the referral and follow-up protocols to follow when a child if found to be at-risk; c. An online manual of video and data for ongoing use by pediatricians, families, and other interested parties. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: New guidelines put forth by the American Academy of Pediatrics now suggest that all children should be screened for Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) using a validated instrument at 18 and 24 months. There is now conclusive evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of intensive early intervention for infants and toddlers with ASD (Dawson and Osterling, 1997; National Research Council, 2001; Myers, Johnson, and the Council on Children with Disabilities, 2007). Children who are not detected at an early age cannot benefit from these early interventions, and the consequences can be life-long and devastating. ASDRA  a web-based, video-intensive software and toolset, is design to assist pediatric practices to more effectively and efficiently provide early surveillance of ASD for children 3 years of age and younger. ASDRA  will improve the accuracy and speed up the process of early identification of children at-risk for ASD so that the appropriate interventions can begin as early as possible and the outcomes of children diagnosed with ASD can be improved.",

The thermally and electrically conductive tape will be detachable and reusable, and, will not have the disadvantages associated with other adhesion methods. Surfaces will not require being smoothed, clean, non-porous, nor ferro-magnetic for adhesion, nor will it require special fixtures for attachment. This project will permit tape to be directly applied as the intermediary between any two surfaces that require 1) high thermal heat transfer from one surface to the other, and/or 2) strong adhesion. The project will explore manufacturing aspects, as well as preparation for production of prototype double-sided adhesive tape with superior thermal and adhesive properties. The coexistent mechanical, thermal and electrical properties, makes this innovative adhesive tape advantageous to many applications including semiconductor chip mounting, heat sinking and systems that require a rapid mount.  The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will mean significant improvements in thermal performance of many electronic devices and time-savings in manufacturing by removing the need to bolt down (sub-) assemblies.

        "abstract": "Almost all of America\u00bfs energy needs are supplied by the combustion of fossil fuels, and a great amount of anthropogenic CO2 is a byproduct of this process.  The DOE has expressed a need for the development of CO2 instrumentation that can be deployed on small balloons and other robotic platforms and can achieve 1 ppm accuracy for a temporal resolution less than 30 seconds.  This project will design and build a new CO2 Nondispersive Infrared (NDIR) technology that is appropriate for a great many robotic platforms.  In Phase I, four prototypes of the new NDIR technology were built and the best of them was selected for more than 50 tests in the laboratory.  This prototype was then configured into a balloon payload that was tested in an environmental chamber within substantial ranges of ambient pressure (830 to 180 mBar) and temperature (+25 to -20 C).  Phase II will build additional production payloads for testing on a tower and on balloons.  The tower payloads will be tested for all four seasons, with the objective of providing an inexpensive tower analyzer system that can be operated autonomously at height for long duration.  The balloon payloads will be tested in an unmanned airborne vehicle to validate performance through the atmospheric boundary layer.Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The new NDIR technology could support the deployment of a great number of robotic platforms, thereby introducing a substantial resource into the developing field of Observational Climate Change.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long term goal of this research is to reduce toxicity and graft rejection due to dosing problems with the calcineurin inhibitors by developing a sustained release subcutaneous injectable formulation of a calcineurin inhibitor. Substantial inter-and intra-patient variability of the calcineurin inhibitors cyclosporine A (CsA) and tacrolimus (Tac) means that even frequent drug monitoring cannot eradicate rejection due to sub- therapeutic troughs or toxicity due to higher than necessary peak levels. In addition, non-adherence with the daily oral dosing regimen is a major cause of graft failure especially in adolescent patients. Pharmacokinetic modeling suggests that periodic subcutaneous dosing can reduce or eliminate many of these problems. The potency and the long elimination half-lives of CsA or Tac make them suitable for depot formulation. In Phase 1 we developed sustained release formulations for cyclosporine and tacrolimus, measured there in vitro dissolution and demonstrated tolerability and sustained release in an in vivo model. We have decided to focus on the development of sustained release CsA in this Phase 2 proposal because it was easier to crystallize and demonstrated superior pharmacokinetics when tested in rats. In addition, because the patents for the parent drug have expired for CsA (and remain in effect for Tac until 2013), we believe that there will be more flexibility in partnering for further development. The specific aims of this Phase 2 proposal are to: 1, optimize the parameters of the sustained release CsA formulation; 2, manufacture clinical lots of the optimized formulation under GMP; and 3, perform animal toxicity and pharmacokinetic studies in rats. The team of investigators is expert in polymer chemistry, pharmacokinetics, and drug development and transplantation biology. We have experience in all aspects of the drug development process, from concept to approval and marketing. The PI led the team that developed two other FDA approved drug delivery systems. More than 50,000 transplants requiring immunosupression are performed annually in the largest 7 markets (US, Japan, Germany, Britain, Canada, France, Italy), and the market for immunosuppressive drugs is estimated at  2.9 Billion annually (2007). We recognize that a sustained release formulation of cyclosporine or tacrolimus will only ever be used in a small percentage of patients. However, each 1% of this market represents  29 million in market opportunity. Our business model is to license to 'big pharma' at the earliest opportunity. Because the likelihood of success is high (we know the drugs work, we are only changing the delivery route), because the costs of clinical trials can be reclaimed under the tax provisions of the Orphan Drug Act, and because we have done this kind of deal before, we are confident that the successful completion of this work will culminate in a commercial product of significant medical utility.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The leading cause of failure in heart, liver, and kidney transplants in children is that kids just stop taking their medicines. The beatific 8 year old who promises never to miss a day, is soon the spiky haired 14 year old who knows better about everything. Missing just a few days can be fatal. We have developed an injectable formulation for the immunosuppressive cyclosporine which has the potential to be delivered weekly, or even less frequently. Because of the long half life of cyclosporine, missing our injection by a day or two is not likely to be a serious problem. Parents can monitor a weekly or semi-monthly schedule much more carefully than daily dosing. An additional benefit of this delivery system is that peak levels that lead to toxicity are blunted, and trough levels, which can lead to failure, are less likely to occur. In Phase 1 we demonstrated proof of concept in an animal model. In Phase 2 we propose to optimize the parameters of the delivery system, manufacture it according to FDA standards, and confirm its delivery profile and safety in further animal studies.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In our Phase 1 project we have developed R-type pyocins, targetable bactericidal proteins, that kill the plague bacterium, Yersinia pestis, in vitro and are not sensitive to the mechanisms that bacteria use to resist antibiotics. Thus, these agents are candidates for protecting or treating humans exposed to plague, particularly strains that have been engineered to be broadly resistant to traditional antibiotics. The same R-type pyocins that can kill Y. pestis in vitro have efficacy when administered intraperitoneally or intravenously to mice infected systemically with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This Phase 2 application proposes to characterize the immunogenicity of R-type pyocins in mice and then determine whether PEGylation of pyocins can reduce their immunogenicity without compromising potency. In addition, we shall complete pharmacokinetic (PK) characterizations of R-type pyocins in mice and rats and establish antimicrobial pharmacodynamic (PD) parameters in mice. These latter studies are necessary to generate PK and PD parameters to guide an efficacy study of R-type pyocins in mice with virulent pneumonic plague under BSL-3 containment. Allometric scaling parameters derived from the PK studies in 2 rodent species will provide guidance for the eventual Phase 1 IND safety and PK studies in humans, not part of this application. The proposed studies will provide critical information about: (1) the immunogenicity of R-type pyocins in mice and modulation of their immunogenicity by selective PEGylation. (2) the pharmacokinetic parameters of these potent bactericidal proteins in mice and rats (3) the antimicrobial pharmacodynamic parameters of R-type pyocins in mice lethally infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4) the efficacy of R-type pyocins in murine pneumonic plague. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Yersinia pestis (plague bacteria) is a Category A pathogen that is deemed a significant threat to the U.S. as a biowarfare agent. If weaponized in an aerosol form, plague can easily gain access to the human respiratory system to cause pneumonia, shock and death within one day. Pneumonic plague, with its rapid progression and fatality rates over 80%, is much more difficult to treat than bubonic plague. Furthermore, this form of plague is highly contagious, being easily passed from human to human or animal to human. Because much of the biology of how bacteria develop drug resistance now is known and a clinical isolate of Y. pestis resistant to 9 antibiotics has been described, weaponized plague bacteria resistant to most front-line antibiotics is a real threat, i.e. a superweapon. We have discovered and designed R-type pyocins that kill plague bacteria in the tube and are not sensitive to the multiple mechanisms bacteria deploy to resist antibiotics. We propose to conduct the pharmacologic studies necessary for the development of R-type pyocins as targetable bactericidal proteins against plague and to demonstrate the efficacy of these R-type pyocins in an animal model of pneumonic plague.",

The requested funds will allow additional characterization studies of three newly discovered mixed vasopressin 1a/1b antagonists, studies that were not part of the original application. These experiments will accelerate preclinical development of the novel mixed antagonists by facilitating identification of clinical candidates within this group of compounds.  Arginine Vasopressin (AVP) antagonists represent a novel therapeutic class for the treatment of depression. The potential utility of these compounds has emerged from observations in depressed individuals, findings in animal models, and an understanding of changes in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis regulation under chronic stress. The active Phase IIa award has two objectives. One is advancing the development of our lead clinical candidate, SRX246-HCl, through a Phase I Clinical Trial. SRX246 is a novel vasopressin 1a (V1a) receptor antagonist that had shown efficacy in preclinical animal models of depression and anxiety, good plasma bioavailability and CNS penetration following oral administration, a strong safety profile, and high affinity and selectivity for the target receptor, The development of this compound to date has been supported by SBIR Phase I, Phase II, and Phase IIa grants, the National Toxicology Evaluation program, a RAID grant, and Series A and Series B private sector investments. All IND-enabling toxicology and safety pharmacology has been completed and an IND application is now under review at the FDA. Assuming approval, a Phase I Clinical Trial to establish safety and tolerability in humans will start in June or July, 2009. The second objective is continued development of back-up compounds, including additional V1a antagonists and mixed AVP 1a/1b antagonists. The Revision Application seeks additional support for preclinical studies that will accelerate clinical candidate identification among newly discovered back-up compounds that are mixed V1a/V1b antagonists. Achieving these goals will enhance commercialization opportunities for Azevan by significantly advancing the likelihood of a partnership with a major pharmaceutical house and/or attracting additional private sector investment.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The public health need for new pharmaceutical treatments for depression is well documented. Depression affects some 20 million Americans each year and carries a conservatively estimated annual total economic burden of  125 billion. Existing drugs for depression are not uniformly effective and frequently have undesirable side effects. These limitations demonstrate that a new treatment approach through vasopressin receptor antagonism in the brain may offer significant opportunities for improved outcomes with substantial societal benefit.",

Locating these cells within entire animals is necessary to study cell delivery, differentiation and gene expression. The Phase II SBIR research is developing an intelligent microtome to provide the means to locate cells within an intact organ or organism and to capture thin sections containing target cells. This instrument will serially section whole organs or small mammals, record multiple wavelength fluorescence images from the tissue after removal of each section, analyze changes in fluorescent patterns in real time, and automatically collect thin sections from areas where fluorescently tagged cells are present.

Instruments will be constructed for testing in university research laboratories studying gene therapy, stem cell behavior, pulmonary dysfunction, and gene transfer by bacterial transfection. A niche analysis of the commercial market for the intelligent microtome was performed during Phase I. The analysis indicated broad interest in this low-cost approach to three- dimensional imaging and the selective automated approach to collection of thin sections. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: New biomedical methods are being designed to deliver DNA, RNA, or stem cells to targeted locations within the body to treat disease conditions.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase-II research project aims to cut the manufacturing cost of an innovative power-efficient ultra-miniature, brushless-servo-electronics module from $1,000 to $100. The module integrates all rotor-position sensing, vector-based commutation, controls, and power supplies needed to drive high-performance brushless servomotors rated up to 300 W (Root Mean Square) and 2 KW (peak) into a single 50-gram module not much bigger than a bottle cap. The cost reduction relies on a set of innovations led by replacement of laser optics used for rotor-position sensing with an array of magnetic field sensors measuring a calibrated target magnet. Phase I demonstrated that well-placed shielding enables high precision and excellent commutation performance even in the proximity of stray fields produced by high switched currents and spinning rotor magnets located in the motor body only millimeters from the sensor array.  This servo-electronics module fits the definition of disruptive technology for entrenched players, such as Danaher/Kollmorgen, Siemens, Fanuc, and Yaskawa, while it will enable scores of original\nequipment manufacturers (OEMs) to improve the performance, compactness, power efficiency, and reliability of their machines at competitive prices. As machines become more intelligent through embedded processing and sensor fusion it will improve not only industrial productivity, but quality of life as society ages. While embedded processors and MEMS-based sensors have become tiny, highly effective, and affordable, similar improvements in servomotors have evolved more slowly. At fractional-horsepower levels the power electronics contribute significantly to total motor-system bulk and complexity. Providing smaller and more efficient servo-electronics will enable OEMs to increase the competitiveness of their products. Robots will become more agile with additional degrees of freedom and less mass to accelerate.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This SBIR Phase II project will develop a cost-effective, easy-to-use, field-portable, and sensitive instrument for rapid screening of avian influenza viruses (AIVs). The Phase I research has demonstrated the feasibili\nty of rapid and sensitive detection of H5N1 AIV in a buffer solution by combination of patent pending bionanobead sample pretreatment, capillary immunocapture, and nano-biolabeling technologies. The proposed biosensor technology was shown to be 103- 104 ti\nmes more sensitive than a commercial rapid test strip. In phase II, the research will be directed to develop a commercial prototype for a cross-contamination-free biosensor system for rapid detection of AIVs and/or H5/H7 subtypes in swab samples. The targe\nt detection limit is a 4-log increase in sensitivity as compared to commercially available rapid test strips. This level of sensitivity will allow for determination of the presence of AIV in asymptomatic birds and will therefore be a useful screen for AI a\nt an early stage of infection. The H5N1 highly pathogenic AIV is the world's largest current pandemic threat. H5 and H7 strains can mutate from low pathogenicity to high pathogenicity during replication and circulation in poultry and thus are very dangerou\ns. Consequently, strengthening the surveillance of AI infection and development of rapid screening technology for in-field detection of AIVs and H5/H7 subtypes is urgently needed. Nearly 2 million AI tests are run each year on turkey and broiler production\n flocks. The proposed testing system has several advantages over AI testing that is performed in centralized laboratories. The advantages include reduced instrumentation price and cost per test, more rapid turn around time for test results, and reduced nee\nd for personnel with specialized training. The proposed system also has significant advantages over currently-approved rapid test kits because of its ability to detect both H5 and H7 subtypes and capability of effectively screening AI infection in seemingl\ny healthy birds prior to shipment for harvest. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed biosensor technology will greatly improve the ability to identify the presence of influenza A and the notifiable subtypes (H5 and H7) of AI in birds that are showing signs\n of illness as well as in birds that are asymptomatic. This product will be valuable to the poultry industry as it will allow for implementation of an early warning system to minimize the spread of the disease and prevent poultry products contaminated with\n AIV from entering the food supply. The regulatory and research community will also be able to monitor the presence of the disease in wild birds in order to gain a better understanding of the spread of this virus on local and global scales.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A Microfluidic Biochip for Rapid Screening of Pesticide Residues Project Summary  The overall goal of this SBIR Phase II project is to develop an easy-to-use, low-cost, field-portable, and sensitive device, HerbiScreen , for rapid screening of pesticide residues in water, beverage, and food samples using an exclusively-licensed patented technology. The screening device consists of a photosynthetic organism-based biochip, either disposable or reusable, and a handheld photocurrent detector. Many pesticides, particularly herbicides, can inhibit photosynthesis in a concentration-dependent manner. Hence, the handheld device can be used as a powerful tool for simultaneously screening multiple pesticide residues. The proof of concept has been successfully demonstrated in Phase I. In Phase I, such a biochip was successfully fabricated and applied to detect atrazine, a model pesticide, in synthetic water and food samples. The biochip is significantly superior to the algae growth-based method in terms of detection limit (1 ppb vs. 100 ppb) and detection time (1 min vs. 2 days). The Phase II work will focus on developing commercial prototypes for the biochip and the testing device. The Phase II specific aims are to:  1) Develop a commercial prototype of disposable, self-contained biochip.  2) Optimize and evaluate the prototype biochip and demonstrate that it can detect atrazine, the model  pesticide, down to 1 ppb (4.6 nM) within 1 min with a shelf-life of e 6 months when stored at ambient  temperature or 4 0C.  3) Develop a commercial prototype of handheld device for rapid screening of pesticide residues using the prototype biochip.  4) Optimize and evaluate the prototype handheld device and demonstrate that it is capable of rapidly screening pesticide residues at a sensitivity level meeting or exceeding the requirements of EPA.  Beyond Phase II, we will have our prototype biochips and handheld devices evaluated at our strategic partners' sites and seek AOAC validation and EPA approval upon successful beta-testings.  Contamination of water and food by pesticides and the potential hazard to human health remain major concerns of our society. Current pesticide detection methods such as HPLC, GC, and ELISA test kits require sophisticated instruments, skilled personnel, extensive sample pretreatment, and/or expensive bioreagents, and thus are unsuitable for on-site or routine screenings. Part of the challenge that faces the regulatory agencies and industries is to find more cost-effective technologies capable of on-site or on-line screening of low-level pesticide residues. Due to the high sensitivity, low cost, ease-to-use, relatively high specificity (compared to commercial water acute toxicity tests based on bioluminescent bacteria) and relatively broad sensing spectrum (compared to commercial ELSA kits and immuno-strips), the proposed biochip technology will be a commercially viable tool for rapid screening of pesticide residues in a variety of sample matrices.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pesticides usually possess a high acute toxicity and/or a wide range of biological activities, and thus even a low level of their residues may adversely impact the environment and human health. The development of the proposed biochip technology will allow screening of pesticide residues in domestic and foreign produce and water supplies prior to entry into the supply chain, thereby enhancing the protection and safety of the nation's agriculture and food supply.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a Phase II Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant application to support the further development of an innovative, online training program to aid in the dissemination of Behavioral Activation (BA), a therapy for depression. The current application represents a continued cooperative partnership between the small business, Behavioral Tech Research, Inc., a company dedicated to disseminating effective psychosocial treatments and Dr. Sona Dimidjian, who with colleagues, developed and evaluated the efficacy of BA. BA is an evidence-based treatment for Major Depressive Disorder, which may have particular transportability advantages compared to other psychosocial treatments with the similar aims. The proposed online training program will substantially aid in the vital training and utilization of this evidence-based practice for both community clinicians and clinical students. The course will be based on our successful Phase I program which was rated highly for usability and content. We plan to substantially expand the content of the training to include all remaining content from the primary BA treatment manual. We will expand the program's interactivities to include highly interactive performance-based learning activities that immerse the user within the treatment context. Ultimately, the aims of this Phase II proposal are to; 1) Determine content for the final program utilizing an advisory board of BA experts; 2) Create the program using an iterative process of development and evaluation; and, 3) Conduct a between-subjects randomized, controlled hybrid efficacy/effectiveness trial (N=240) using an additive research design to evaluate gains in knowledge and application of BA and gains in self-efficacy for conducting BA therapy with patients suffering from major depression. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Major depression is a pervasive and debilitating disorder, for which the majority of individuals receive no or inadequate treatment, despite the fact that efficacious treatments exist. Increasing the availability of such treatments requires widely available and effective training materials that will facilitate the utilization of such approaches by practicing clinicians. Behavioral Activation (BA) is an evidence-based practice for depression that may have important transportability advantages; this project aims to further develop an innovative, interactive online training program teaching the principles of BA, in order to increase the dissemination of this evidence-based treatment and improve clinical outcomes for adults suffering from depression.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a Phase II Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant application to support the further development of an innovative, online training program to aid in the dissemination of exposure therapies (ETs) for anxiety disorders. ETs have consistently and robustly been found effective in the treatment of anxiety disorders. However, these evidence-based treatments are rarely used in real world clinical settings and this appears to be due primarily to a lack of training in general exposure principles and procedures among clinical practitioners. The primary goal of this project is to facilitate the dissemination of ETs for anxiety disorders to treatment providers by completing an innovative foundational course online training (OLT) in exposure principles, techniques, and procedures commonly used in exposure therapies for anxiety disorders. The project contains three central aims: 1) to complete the development of the final OLT product using an iterative process that involves extensive feedback from target end-users and exposure experts throughout its development; 2) to test the efficacy of the exposure online training course in a between subjects randomized controlled trial (RCT) using an additive design; and 3) to evaluate the relative merit of adding a Motivational Interviewing (MI) procedure involving two 20-minute interviews with subjects to determine if the addition of MI before starting and upon completing the OLT will positively impact outcomes. Exposure-naove treatment providers who have agreed to participate in the research will be randomly assigned to one of three condition: text (n=63), text+OLT (n=63), and text+OLT+MI (n=63). Subjects will be assessed at baseline, post-training, and at a 30 day and 60 day follow up. Major outcome variables will include: knowledge, self-efficacy, satisfaction, attitudinal change about exposure therapy, and engagement in further training in disorder-specific protocols (e.g., Panic Control Treatment for panic disorder). Additionally, subjects will complete two application based measures, including a performance-based role play. These therapy simulation measures will be conducted at baseline, post-test, and at the 60 day follow up. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Anxiety disorders are the most common mental illness in the United States and are associated with significant personal, social, and economic costs. The vast majority of individuals with anxiety disorders receive no or inadequate treatment and this is due, in part, to a failure to disseminate evidence-based treatments to community mental health settings. Exposure therapies are highly effective, evidence-based treatments for anxiety disorders that may be readily transportable to community clinicians. This project aims to further develop an innovative online training of exposure principles and procedures to facilitate the dissemination of exposure therapies and improve clinical outcomes for individuals suffering from anxiety disorders.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): More than 50% of drugs on the market target G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Among the most important of these are drugs used to treat neurological disorders, such as pain relievers, antidepressants and anti-psychotics, as well drugs used for neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. The relatively recent discovery of a family of proteins called  regulator of G protein signaling  (RGS), that attenuate GPCR signals by increasing the GTPase activity of associated G proteins, has opened up a new avenue for modulating the activity of endogenous and administered GPCR ligands. However, development of inhibitors to RGS proteins has been hampered by the lack of robust assay methods for high throughput screening (HTS). In Phase I we developed fluorescence based GDP detection assays to measure RGS-dependent increases in the steady state GTPase activity of modified G proteins. The G proteins were mutated to increase the rate of GDP dissociation relative to GTP hydrolysis so that the GTPase accelerating activity of RGS proteins could be directly measured. These developments comprise the first HTS-compatible biochemical assay system for measuring RGS catalytic activity. In Phase II we will extend the approach to additional RGS and G proteins, and use the novel molecular tools in combination with cheminformatics to develop RGS-selective small molecule inhibitors. The inhibitors will be characterized biochemically and there in a cellular context. The availability of these novel HTS assays and inhibitors will accelerate drug discovery focused on RGS proteins and delineation of their roles in GPCR signal transduction. We will continue our successful collaboration with Dr. David Siderovski at the Department of Pharmacology, University of North Carolina Medical School in Phase II. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Over half of current drugs exert their effects through a family of proteins called G protein- coupled receptors, and the targeting of these receptors has been especially useful for the development of drugs used to treat neurological disorders such as schizophrenia, depression, and Parkinson's disease. To accelerate discovery of more selective therapies for these and other diseases, we are developing and validating novel screening assays for a family of proteins, called 'regulator of G-protein signaling' (RGS) that modulate the effects of GPCR ligands in a tissue-specific manner.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Leukocyte recruitment is central to inflammation, and there is intense focus on inhibiting the process both for chronic inflammatory disorders and for conditions where inflammation plays a contributory role, such as atherosclerosis. Whereas current anti-inflammatory drugs such as NSAIDs target secondary effects that are induced after inflammation is already established, inhibiting leukocyte recruitment would prevent the initiation of inappropriate inflammatory responses. Chemotaxis - the movement of cells aligned with a chemical gradient - is the fundamental process underlying neutrophil recruitment. Despite its importance, there are limited screening tools available for medium to high throughput analysis of leukocyte recruitment. Typically, primary screening incorporates a molecular target such as an enzyme or receptor, and hits are then validated in cumbersome in vitro cell migration assays. Existing assays suffer from three main problems: 1) Lack of repeatability (e.g. due to trapped air), 2) need for manual operations (e.g. filter removal), and 3) large cell number requirement (e.g. 1x105 cells/datum). We aim to solve each of these problems by taking advantage of microfluidic technology. In this phase II project we will establish injection molding of full plate (i.e. 96 unit) parts and adapt manufacturing methods developed under the phase I grant to produce devices that suitable for automation. We will use these devices to show reproducibility and data quality while reducing the number of cells required per datum 10-fold. Importantly we will demonstrate the use of the microfluidic chemotaxis device in a high content screening study where multi-parametric image- based analysis is applied to test both migration and polarization of primary human neutrophils. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The migration of cells from the bloodstream to sites of injury is one of the fundamental processes underlying chronic inflammatory disorders such as arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. Responding cells migrate toward higher concentrations of signaling molecules that are released at the injury site. To enable the discovery of drugs to block this process, we are developing plastic devices for high throughput cell migration assays in defined chemical gradients.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This project will modify an existing emailed program to improve diet and physical activity (PA), by making it more appropriate for workers 55-64 years of age and by adding the ability to deliver automated interactive telephone messages and printed materials tailored to the individual. It will then test the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of those approaches among workers aged 55-64. Background: Poor diet and physical inactivity are two of the top three causes of chronic diseases and their subsequent medical costs (1). Inexpensive and cost-effective methods are needed to improve these behaviors in this age group, a group with increasing chronic disease and impending Medicare use. The research will build on an existing emailed intervention, ALIVE, which was proven effective in a randomized controlled trial in a worksite (2,3). ALIVE includes a Health Risk Assessment (HRA), tailored feedback, extensive tailoring, weekly goal- setting, interactive features, and health information. Methods: Aims in Phase I are to enhance all components of ALIVE to improve appropriateness for persons 55-64 years, based on focus groups, usability testing, and input from experts in PA ,diet behavior change and aging. Phase I will also demonstrate ability to link ALIVE with new automated telephone and print components. In Phase II, the age-tailored ALIVE will be tested in a randomized controlled trial. Staff and faculty on two campuses of the University of California will be enrolled; those aged 55-64 will be randomized to A) a control group receiving only the HRA and feedback; B) the age-tailored ALIVE program; C) the age-tailored ALIVE program plus phone and print materials. Baseline assessments include diet and PA, and the WHO Health and Work Performance Questionnaire (HPQ). Groups B and C then focus on either increasing PA, increasing fruits and vegetables, or decreasing saturated and trans- fats and added sugars. Over a 4-month period participants will receive tailored email messages and goals, plus phone/print (in group C). At the end of the 4-month period, control and intervention groups will repeat the baseline assessments. Intervention groups will then choose one of the other two goals. This will be repeated again at the end of the second 4-month period, for a total of one year of intervention, with repeat evaluations at the end. Changes in PA, diet, self-reported health and work outcomes will be evaluated using Intention to Treat. Two components of cost effectiveness will be evaluated. First, the effect of observed diet and PA changes on health care costs will be estimated using published external data on the effect of such changes on subsequent risk of chronic disease and cost impacts. Second, improvements in absenteeism and presenteeism as measured by the HPQ will be assessed and monetized based on the HPQ; this will also be expressed as Return on Investment, a metric wanted by employers in decisions about adoption of wellness interventions. The costs and effectiveness of the three treatment arms of the study will be compared. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Almost 45% of Americans have at least one chronic disease, and the medical costs for persons with chronic disease account for almost 75% of health care costs (1). Two of the top three leading causes of death are poor diet and physical inactivity (1). Improvement in these behaviors will result in less morbidity and lower health care costs, and this project will test the effectiveness of a very low-cost proven intervention in a high- risk age group.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of this grant is to develop a non-invasive method for assessment of insulin resistance and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) as a measure of pre-diabetes suitable for application to large-scale screening studies and to individualized preventive strategies in patients at risk for development of diabetes. This new approach is based on the known alterations in the mix of whole-body fuel utilization that occurs during progression from normal glucose tolerance to impaired glucose tolerance to diabetes. It involves administration of a standard oral glucose tolerance test solution that contains, in addition, a small quantity of the non-radioactive (stable isotope) 13C6-glucose, followed by measurement of breath 13CO2 isotope enrichment. During Phase-I of this project, we have established the proof-of-concept and feasibility of this approach. We have demonstrated that the correlation of the said method with the common indices of insulin resistance possesses similar statistical strength compared with those published for these indices and the currently accepted gold standard, i.e. the glucose-clamp. We have also demonstrated that inter-individual reproducibility of the breath test as a measure of IGT is acceptably low and its correlation with OGTT sufficiently high to permit its development as a non-invasive test of IGT. During Phase-II, we will conduct a number of clinical investigations to: 1) evaluate the intra- and inter-individual variability of our method compared to the glucose-clamp, the three common indices (HOMA-IR, QUICKI, and WBISI), and the standard OGTT; and 2) to evaluate the correlation between our proposed breath test, the glucose-clamp, common indices, and OGTT in individuals whose glycemia ranges from normal glucose tolerance (NGT) to impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) to diabetes and whose body mass index (BMI) covers the range from lean to obese. We anticipate that successful completion of the Phase-II research will lead to the development of a routine method for assessment of insulin resistance and a non-invasive test of IGT for application to screening and individualized preventive studies. After successful completion of Phase-II research and with non-SBIR funding, we will establish a central facility to produce and market appropriate  test kit(s)  along with the necessary analytical expertise - making the method available to all interested parties for clinical or research purposes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Insulin resistance and impaired glucose tolerance are early manifestations of serious chronic disorders of major concern to public health: diabetes, chronic heart disease, obesity, hypertension, etc. Their early recognition is important for preventive purposes. Currently, the  Gold Standard  for assessing insulin resistance is the so-called glucose-clamp, which is not suitable for general-purpose clinical management of patients. The surrogate methods available currently, the so-called Common indices show large inter- individual variability's for any given value of their corresponding glucose-clamp and, thus, are not suitable for individualized preventive purposes. During Phase-I of this SBIR program, we have demonstrated that a non- invasive Breath Test has the potential to be a suitable surrogate test for the glucose-clamp and as a non- invasive measure of impaired glucose tolerance (pre-diabetes). During Phase-II, we propose to develop this test and to demonstrate its high linear correlation with both the glucose-clamp and oral glucose tolerance test.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop a rapid, low cost, threshold assay for the detection of HIV infection of HIV vaccination trial participants. The assay we propose to develop will use our proprietary helicase dependent amplification (HDA) platform as well as a low cost device specifically designed to perform molecular tests without contaminating the laboratory with amplification products. HDA is similar to the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in that it uses two primers to exponentially amplify nucleic acids. It is distinct from PCR in that it is entirely isothermal (and thus does not require costly thermocyclers). We propose to use a lateral flow device to detect amplification products. Such devices have already proven their utility in separating nucleic acid amplification products, and are widely used in several  moderate complexity  and CLIA-waived tests listed in the FDA device database. Detection of amplicons will be accomplished by using latex particles conjugated to antibodies that bind to the probes used to detect the HDA reaction products. The assay uses a sandwich format to detect haptens (biotin, FITC and Digoxigenin) incorporated into one of the HDA primers and into each of the detection probes. The lateral flow strip used for these assays has two capture zones, and thus allows for the detection of one analyte (HIV) as well as a competitive internal control. Assays that fail to give a band in the lateral flow device window are scored as invalid, while assays with a band in the control line alone are scored as true negative. Assays with bands at both the control and test line position are scored as positives at the threshold value (typically 200 copies of the analyte). Assays with a strong band in the test line but no control line are scored as strong positives (typically over 5000 copies of analyte). Preliminary studies suggest a limit of detection of 100 copies/mL plasma when nucleic acids extracted from plasma samples with a sequence-specific capture method are used as templates for RT-HDA. We propose to further test the specificity and sensitivity of the HIV test with clinical specimens obtained from 5 high-risk patient recruitment sites. Assays will be performed at BioHelix, and at Vanderbilt University. Kits will be supplied to Dr. Yi-Wei Tang (Vanderbilt University) so his laboratory can evaluate the assays. In addition, we propose to perform a validation study at the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) of South Africa to gain clearance to sell kits in South Africa. Finally, we may also contract with Assuragen to engineer a clone of Armored RNA for our competitive internal control. By the end of Phase II, we will have preliminary data for submission of an IDE to the FDA to kick-off a clinical study to seek pre market approval (PMA) for sale of the assay system for human diagnostics in the US. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: More than 90 % of the 40 million human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected persons live in Third World countries (see www.unaids.org/bangkok2004/GAR2004_html/GAR2004_03_en.htm). Unfortunately, performing HIV molecular tests in resource poor settings is difficult. BioHelix's proprietary helicase dependent amplification (HDA) platform is similar to the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in that it uses two primers to exponentially amplify nucleic acids. HDA is distinct from PCR in that it is entirely isothermal (and thus does not require costly thermocyclers). Indeed, HDA can be performed in a simple  100 water bath. To illustrate the potential of this technology for the third world, we currently sell HDA reagents as part of a teaching kit for use in high schools (sold through Carolina Biological Supply). BioHelix is combining this HDA technology with a low cost (~ 2-  3.75) disposable device specifically designed to perform molecular tests without contaminating the laboratory with amplicons. The device uses a lateral flow system to detect amplification products. Lateral flow devices are common in many moderately complex, and CLIA-waived tests listed on the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) device database. We believe this combination of characteristics makes our proposed product ideal for the HIV vaccine trial sites. A low cost nucleic acid screening test will help identify those people and reduce the spread of the HIV epidemic as well as benefit participants in HIV vaccination trials who become infected with the virus. An estimated 16 to 22 million persons aged 18-64 years are tested annually for HIV in the United States (see http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5347a4.htm). Most of the near patient testing relies on rapid tests like OraQuick while most hospital screening programs use enzyme immuno assay (EIA). Walensky et al. (2008) recently reported that using western blot alone as a confirmation test for oral rapid tests provides conclusive HIV status in only 50% of patients at first follow-up. Such patients are typically asked to return for testing in ~ 1 month. In contrast, performing an HIV-1 RNA test to confirm the rapid test, when a western blot fails to do so, improves this rate to 96.2% in the first round of testing. Considering that our assay system relies of minimal instrumentation we feel our test can offer an additional layer of confirmation for OraQuick positives at the near patient setting and in the developing world and thus relieve the need for asking patients to return for testing in 1 month.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hemorrhage resulting from traumatic injuries is a major cause of death in accidents, and the primary cause of death on the battlefield. Over 40% of the trauma cases admitted at hospitals in the USA, are due to road traffic accidents. Hemorrhage is the primary cause of death on the battlefield in conventional warfare. The vast majority of these deaths occur before the injured can be transported to a treatment facility. Tissue adhesives and sealants have been developed to control bleeding; but, since all existing haemostatic agents for abdominal intracavitary bleeding are designed to be used in the operating room, not in an emergency at the site of accident or in the battlefield, hemorrhage is often lethal. With early and effective hemorrhage control, more lives can be saved than by any other measure. The goal of the project, is to determine the effectiveness and safety of ClotFoam, a novel gelatin- based fibrin sealant, as a hemostatic agent to stop hemorrhage without compression in cases of severe hemorrhage resulting from intracavitary wound grade III/IV (as measured in the liver), and a novel method of application to be used outside the operating room. The use of this technology can be extended for use in cases of minimally invasive surgery, laparoscopy, brain and gynecological surgery. This technology is based on the physical and coagulation properties of a fibrin sealant embedded in a scaffold, enhanced by pro-coagulants, and delivered as a foam through a C02-propelled delivery device. Phase I studies have provided the  proof of concept  for the use of ClotFoam as non-compressible technology in cases of hemorrhage resulting from very severe trauma (grade 3/grade 4) and in laparoscopic or minimally invasive surgical procedures, by establishing the ability of the agent to adhere to lacerated tissue in a pool of blood. Data obtained from studies in rats, rabbits, and pigs have demonstrated that ClotFoam can generate an adaptable foam that is distributed uniformly; and adheres to the abdominal cavity, even under profuse bleeding, when it is injected intraperitoneally, improving the adhesiveness between lacerated tissue, and initiating a rapid clot formation. Furthermore, Clotfoam's fibrin sealant component has been developed with an advanced technology that overcomes two fundamental problems encountered by fibrin sealants: Shelf life and autoimmune reaction against thrombin. The specific aims of this phase II proposal are to 1) develop a method to sterilize and preserve the agent under ambient conditions, and determine the proteolitic degradation, activity and shelf life of fibrin components maintained under standard refrigeration conditions; 2) Evaluate the material biocompatibility in a subdermal model in the rat. Once it has been determined that the formulation can be sterilized and it is biocompatible, and therefore will not require further modifications, we will 3) develop a standardized animal model (pig) to study the effects of hemostatic agents in cases of non-compressible severe hemorrhage, subsequent to grades III and IV wounds to the liver, resulting from severe traumatic injury; 4) evaluate the ability of ClotFoam to achieve hemostasis in a pig model, following progressively severe hemorrhage secondary to high-flow bleeding caused by grade III, IV liver injury; and assess animal survival at 1 hour, as compared to the control. And finally 5) we will assess safety of the agent through the evaluation of immunological risks, as well as prevention of adhesions, abdominal compartment syndrome, and delayed hematoma and/or edema formation. This data will be used to file for an Investigational New Drug (IND) application and proceed to the clinical stage. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In an age of speed, civil violence and armed conflicts, the incidence of penetrating and blunt injuries to the abdomen has been on the increase. On average, 41.8% of the trauma cases admitted at hospitals, nationwide, are due to road traffic accidents. Also, hemorrhage remains the primary cause of death on the battlefield in conventional warfare. Morbidity and mortality from these abdominal injuries pose a formidable problem, especially in young adults. Early and effective hemorrhage control could theoretically save more lives than any other measure. Unfortunately, all existing haemostatic agents for abdominal intracavitary bleeding day available today are designed to be used in the OPERATING ROOM-not at the locus of injury (i.e. battlefield, car accident, or scene of a shot wound). All available hemostatic agents and sealants require compression, and therefore they cannot be used even in cases of minimally invasive surgery such as laparoscopic surgery. ClotFoam, a novel agent that allows to inject a sealing foam inside a body cavity to seal wounds and stop bleeding has proved to be effective in animal studies. The agent is applied through a mixing needle, similar to a Veress needle-releasing a foam inducer and procoagulants incorporated into gelatin sealants that adhere to injured tissue, compress the wound and stops the bleeding. In this study we to further study the effectiveness and safety, including biocompatibility of ClotFoam in cases of severe hemorrhage caused by grade III and IV traumatic wounds which-if not treated immediately-would lead to exsanguinations. This therapeutic approach will reduce killed in action (KIA) rate, provide new therapeutic tools for paramedics, increase life-saving capability for the medic, offer new t options for laparoscopic and other minimally invasive surgery, and reduce need for surgery and transfusion.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Approximately 1 out of every 5 Americans is infected with herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2). Localized genital infection by HSV-2 results in painful recurring genital lesions while disseminated infection can involve multiple visceral organs and lethal encephalitis. Using Phase 1 funding we have developed a new heterologous immunization protocol composed of a glycoprotein D (gD) DNA vaccine followed by a liposome-encapsulated gD boost. This protocol induces robust serum IgG antigen-specific antibodies, mucosal IgG and secretory IgA and a T helper type 1 (Th1)-biased immune response. Mice immunized with this protocol are protected from disease after infection with 100 times the lethal dose of virus. Use of a higher priming dose of DNA revealed sterilizing immunity in 80% of immunized mice. We are requesting Phase 2 funding to complement and extend the studies in preparation for preclinical safety testing. The requested funding will be used to further characterize immune mediators induced by the novel HSV-2 vaccine. Funding will also be used to evaluate commercial suppliers of vaccine components and establish quality control parameters. Dosing of components will be further optimized in preparation for human use and toxicity testing. Guinea pigs will be used to demonstrate efficacy of the vaccine in a second animal model and to test the ability of the vaccine to prevent establishment of latency and/or reactivation of latent virus. The end result of these experiments will be the establishment of a novel vaccine for HSV-2. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This vaccine would clearly have an impact on the greater than  1.6 billion spent annually on direct medical costs associated with HSV-2. The Public Health Service (PHS) has recognized the significant public health issues caused by herpes simplex virus. The PHS publication,  Healthy People 2010 , has set sexually transmitted diseases as a national priority with a goal to reduce the number of adults infected with human papilloma virus and HSV-2.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This SBIR project is developing the first geostatistical software to offer tools that are specifically designed for the geostatistical analysis of both aggregated and individual-level health data, providing: (1) the description of spatial patterns of cancer incidence and mortality rates and identification of nested scales of variation; (2) the spatial interpolation of individual-level data to create isopleth maps of relative risk accounting for area-based data (e.g. contextual factors), model for population density and locational uncertainty due to geocoding errors; (3) the identification of clusters and hotspots of significantly high or low incidence or mortality rates; (4) the detection of significant disparities between rates for different ethnic groups and genders; and (5) the visualization of changes in disparity through time. This project will accomplish 6 aims: 1. Conduct a requirements analysis to identify methods and functionality to incorporate into the software. 2. Develop innovative non-parametric geostatistical techniques for identifying nested scales of variation, exploring the combined impact of covariates on incidence rates, and the creation of incidence risk maps that incorporate both individual-level and area-based data. 3. Develop new methodologies for incorporation of locational uncertainty into the geostatistical analysis, disaggregation of population data to allow the isopleth mapping of mortality rates, assessment and propagation of the uncertainty attached to mapped rates through hypothesis testing, such as the detection of significant interactions between covariates or the delineation of areas of significant gender disparities. 4. Build and test a complete set of functionalities based on the research results and simulation studies, and incorporate them into Biomedware's space-time visualization and analysis technology. 5. Apply the software and methods to demonstrate the approach and its unique benefits for the investigation of geographic, ethnic and gender variations in cancer stage at diagnosis and survival data, and the exploration of relationships between health outcomes and potential factors, such as environmental and occupational exposures, socio-economic conditions, and proximity to screening facilities. 6. Create instructional materials, including a short course, to foster the adoption of this approach in health science. Feasibility of this project was demonstrated in Phase I. This Phase II project will accomplish aims three through six. These technologic, scientific and commercial innovations will revolutionize our ability to interpret variation in cancer incidence at multiple spatial scales and across time, to understand the causes underlying observed racial, gender and geographic disparities in incidence, mortality and survival rates, and to quantify the long- term benefits of current strategies for reducing the disproportionate incidence of cancer morbidity and mortality among minorities and the medically underserved in the United States. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The substantial benefit of this research is its utility in accessing, linking, mapping and analyzing diverse individual-level and population-based data including cancer vital events and possibly area wide distributions of social class measures. The methods developed in this project will help generating hypotheses for in depth individual studies of risk factors that are causal, or impact survival or morbidity, and establishing the rationale for targeted cancer control interventions, including consideration of health services needs, and resource allocation for screening and diagnostic testing.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will develop new approaches for evaluating cancer clusters using case-only data. To date three major deficiencies of studies of space-time clustering are that they assume the place-of-residence at time of observation (e.g. diagnosis or death) is representative of place-based exposures over the life course; do not routinely assess the sensitivity of the results to geocoding error; and do not assess sensitivity of the results to specification of cancer latency. These limitations are overcome by this project. Case-only data describing place of residence and date of diagnosis/death, gender, race, age, cancer treatment, sources of comorbidity, tumor stage, and contextual variables associated with residential location such as extent urban (e.g. Beale index), and a wealth of other data are commonly available in state cancer registries. These data will be coupled with commercially available residential histories (whose accuracy was validated in Phase I using data) to determine: (1) Whether, where and when statistically significant space-time clusters arise; (2) Whether such clusters are attributable to known covariates, cancer treatments, and contextual variables; (3) How sensitive the results are to geocoding error that may vary across the urban-rural continuum; (4) Those locations, cases, local neighborhoods and dates most sensitive to geocoding error; and (5) estimates of cancer latency most likely to explain observed space-time clustering. This approach is applied to pancreatic cancer in Michigan to determine whether space-time clustering of incident cases may be explained by Hepatitis-B. This novel analytical approach is a significant advance over currently used methods that ignore residential mobility, geocoding error and cancer latency. The major innovation is the creation of methods and software for analyzing cancer case- data to accurately identify space-time cancer clusters while accounting for residential mobility, geocoding error, and specification of cancer latency. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Principal Investigator: Jacquez, Geoffrey M. Case-only Cancer Clustering for Mobile Populations Relevance: The techniques and software from this project will provide a more concise and accurate description of space-time cancer clusters using data readily available in the nation's cancer registries via (1) coupling case-level data with commercially available residential histories in an easy to use, web-based interface; (2) the automated evaluation of the sensitivity of the results to geocoding error for the specific geography, cancer and sub-population being scrutinized by the software user; (3) the automated estimation of the range of cancer latencies most likely to explain observed space-time clusters; and (4) Novel space-time cluster statistics that appropriately account for residential mobility, know risk factors, covariates and cancer latency. To our knowledge the techniques and software from this project will be the first to address all of these factors within a single, comprehensive framework.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hybrid Nanochannel Arrays for Single Molecule Linear Genome Analysis Abstract The objective of this proposal is to develop a fully integrated nanofluidic device for single molecule analysis of long, linearized, native state genomic DNA. The project will result in a simple, disposable chip that will allow direct, fluorescent single molecule analysis of structural, CNV, haplotype and epigenomic variations at the single molecule level. The resulting commercial system will permit researchers and clinicians to directly visualize genomic variations from a few kilobases to megabases in length, from as little as a single cell to common bulk preparation methods, on common microscope imaging systems. Advances in technologies to analyze complex genomes have allowed for significant collection and analysis of a wide range of genetic data including gross structural variation, repetitive elements, genotypes, haplotypes and more generically, the DNA sequence. But current technologies suffer from relatively low sensitivity and specificity due to data generated from averaged heterogeneous bulk sample preparations or difficulties in standardizing and scaling up the analytical platform and biochemical protocols. The proposed hybrid micro/nanofluidic device will allow isolation, manipulation and direct imaging of single molecule features without significantly changing upstream biochemical process of the samples. Leveraging high quality mass micro/nanofabrication technology developed by the semiconductor industry, these devices could be made truly affordable to end users while allowing consistent and comparable results on a standardized format. Based upon phase I results, we will optimize a nearly universal, high resolution single molecule level DNA analysis device. The specific aims of phase II are to 1) develop fluorescent standards and sample buffer for evaluating device performance, 2)develop a simple, disposable chip cartridge that can be easily loaded by standard pipetting, 3) develop a modular joystick control system for manipulating the flow of DNA within the device while mounted on standard microscopy systems. Completion of this project will result in an integrated biochip device capable of providing statistically significant, single-molecule-level analysis of megabase DNA with sub-kilobase resolution. This technology could greatly enhance our ability to understand many different types of genetic variations and of genomic instabilities related to cancer and other genetic diseases with consistent and reproducible performance that will enable broad incorporation of single molecule analysis into diagnostic and medical genetics applications. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The development of an open architecture, single molecule, linear DNA analysis system will provide researchers and clinicians alike a new tool for genomic investigation, providing new insights into the complexity of human genetic disease and genome structure. The availability of an inexpensive, disposable nanodevice compatible with common microscopy systems will enable broad access to single molecule research of human genome variation, such as structural mapping, haplotyping and even copy number variation, as well as the characterization of overall genomic state. This will help expand the use of genomic analysis as a tool for understanding complex disorders and will help enable the realization of practical, cost effective personalized medicine.",

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop technologies that optimize the use of RNA interference (RNAi) in animals. RNAi is an invaluable tool for characterizing gene function and is a promising candidate for gene therapy. The use of RNAi in tissue culture is well developed but is of limited use in experimental animals. RNAi agents must enter cells to exert their effects but this has proven to be challenging in animals. The current lack of such technologies is holding back the majority of important RNAi animal experiments. To open this bottleneck, kits and reagents will be developed based on Bioo Scientific?s Targeted Transport Technology (T3). Easy-to-use RNAi delivery products will be manufactured, validated and commercialized for use in animal experiments.  The broader impacts of this research are twofold. First, researchers will gain ready access to products that greatly simplify the use of RNAi in animals, thereby, stimulating a burst of validation experiments in animals to try to replicate prior results derived from tissue culture experiments. Animals are more complex than their tissue culture counterparts and it is uncertain that results can be duplicated in an animal. Second, T3 has the potential to be used for the therapeutic delivery of RNAi agents. In sum, this project will propel the validation of tissue culture results via T3 enabled animal experimentation, leading to a better understanding of cellular pathways, the identification of novel drug targets, and the potential to deliver RNAi agents as drugs.",

        "abstract": "The safety of the public food supply is an emerging and important public health issue in the United States. Recent, widely-reported food and feed contaminations by pathogens and banned substances such as melamine have fueled an increased demand for improved assays to screen and protect the food supply. The antibody-based ELISA assay is a powerful, cost-effective method to detect trace analytes, such as banned substances, in food samples. While ELISA assays can detect many different types of banned substances, a number of low molecular weight analytes, such as melamine or histamine (a marker for seafood samples contaminated the bacteria which cause scombroid poisoning) are too small for use as antigens to develop high-quality ELISA assays. Consequently there are currently no rapid, reliable screening methods to detect many low molecular weight banned substances in food and feed supplies. In contrast to antibodies, protein enzymes can bind small molecules (MW < 100) very specifically. Surprisingly however, the potential advantages of using enzymes to detect banned substances in food and feed supplies has never been thoroughly investigated. In our Phase I research, we invented two new rapid tests to detect melamine and histamine. In Phase II, we will develop robust detection kits using theses enzyme-based assays to detect banned substances, such as melamine, in food and feed. We will also enhance our enzyme manufacturing capability to internally produce larger quantities of low cost high activity enzymes. Successful commercial development of these kits during Phase II will result in much needed improved rapid testing products for melamine and histamine and provide a solid foundation for future development of other assays using enzymes from bacteria which metabolize banned substances in the environment. These assays will be an effective new tool in developing improved procedures for comprehensive yet cost-effective screening of food samples to better ensure the safety of our food and feed supplies.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Lyme Disease (LD) is the most common vector-borne infectious disease in the United States and remains a significant public health concern. The laboratory diagnosis of LD depends on the demonstration of antibodies against Borrelia burgdorferi. Current serologic assays are not specific enough and not sensitive in early LD. New assays are needed and we plan to fill this unmet need. Our main objective is to produce new sensitive and specific peptide based assays for the serodiagnosis of LD. In Phase I we made excellent progress in defining components for a new serologic assay: we developed IR6 peptides with a broader ability to detect antibody reactivity among patients infected with spirochetes expressing different VlsE sequences; of the 17 known US OspC groups we have identified four (B, F, I, and K) as potential targets for epitope mapping; and we evaluated the ability of a multi-antigenic peptide comprised of sequences from OspC (10 residues), FlaB (13 residues) and VlsE-IR6 (17 residues) to bind antibody from individuals with LD. In this Phase II proposal, we will further optimize the peptides containing epitopes from OspC, FlaB and IR6 and will validate new immunoassays in both ELISA and rapid lateral flow point-of-care (POC) formats. An assay with greater specificity and improved sensitivity for detection of B. burgdorferi antibodies in the earliest stages of the disease, could lead to the development of a single-tier test capable of replacing the currently recommended two-tier paradigm. More importantly, given that early diagnosis and treatment of LD prevents illness progression and sequellae, the development of this test will make an important contribution to improvement of human health.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Lyme disease, the most common vector borne infectious disease in the United States affects multiple organ systems. Although prompt diagnosis and treatment prevents or limits serious injury to the systems affected, current sero- diagnostics for Lyme disease lack sensitivity in early disease and are not specific enough to be used alone. Our objective is to replace today's assays with a new multi-antigen peptide test. Because of greater specificity and improvement to the assay's sensitivity, this approach could lead to the development of a single tier assay to detect antibodies against any of the three pathogenic genospecies ofB. burgdorferi in both early and late Lyme disease.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ultrasound (US) facilitated formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue specimen preparation technology (US-FFPE) is developed from the widely accepted FFPE technology by introducing ultrasound in every step of the process. The US-FFPE does not change the gold standard FFPE tissue morphology. However, it greatly reduces tissue specimen preparation time. The whole procedure of FFPE tissue specimen preparation is reduced from 16-48 hr to 20-60 min. The final diagnosis of cancers can be produced in a few hours after surgery or biopsy instead of a few days. This increase of turnaround rate will considerably save patient care costs and greatly relieve patients' psychological burdens in waiting for results. Besides accelerating reagent penetration into tissues, the US-FFPE technology changes the mechanism of biomolecule modification and cross-linking caused by formalin fixation. Biomolecules are much more accessible for detection and extraction. The fact that tissue specimens are  frozen in time  at the point of US-FFPE fixation can greatly improve the integrity of biomolecules in tissue specimens, especially for mRNA and phosphoproteins. The Phase I of this project is highly successful. We have constructed a prototype US-FFPE device with continuous-flow and multi-sample capacity. Morphological and molecular biology assay results on tissue specimens produced by the prototype US-FFPE device were highly comparable or even superior to those on tissue specimens produced by the conventional FFPE method. Our goal of the Phase II project is to construct a prototype US-FFPE device that can be applied in clinical tissue specimen preparation to produce standardized tissue specimens at much increased turnaround rate. Different from the conventional FFPE method, the US-FFPE method relies on US to increase speed. With much shortened sample processing time, strict control of the machine performance parameters is critical. Under Phase II, we will develop a highly reliable US-FFPE device with real-time quality control and quality assurance (QC/QA) system. The Phase II objectives are: 1) to improve the prototype Phase I US-FFPE device by optimizing the existing functions to achieve high device reliability as well as by addition of new functions to achieve QC/QA; 2) to perform systemic morphological and molecular studies with various tissue types to validate the device and to collect optimal machine operating parameters.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is an increasing number of cases and spread of Lyme and other tick-borne diseases in the United States. The same tick that can transmit the agent of Lyme disease, Borrelia burgdorferi, can simultaneously transmit other pathogens such as Babesia, Anaplasma, and Rickettsia. This is of great concern to the public and their physicians. This concern is reflected in a greater demand for tests that can provide information as to what is in an individual tick and what can be transmitted. Current diagnostic testing methods for these disease causing pathogens are generally limited to a single microbe and/or unreliable. No test exists that can cover the breadth of pathogens transmitted by ticks. In our Phase I application, we achieved our aim, the proof of concept, that our methodology could detect multiple microbes and even in a single tick. That system employs broad-range PCR and mass spectroscopy (PCR/ESI-MS). The assay identified and speciated broad groups of bacteria, including known tick- borne bacteria and flaviviruses. The success of this, coupled with the increasing demand and increasing number of searches performed for Borrelia alone, is the basis for Phase 2 to concentrate on the development of a tick-borne pathogen detection assay using the high throughput PCR/ESI-MS. In Phase 1, the proof of principle of detection of pathogens was accomplished with 16 primer pairs in 16 wells of a 96 well kitted plate. In Phase 2, Goal 1 of this is to increase clinically useful throughput time and efficiency of the assay and consequently reduce costs. We will have a target goal of 8 wells (PCR reactions) by eliminating redundancy and multiplexing. Goal 2: Optimize and add to these, Babesia detection primers. Goal 3: Create a replenishable bank of nucleic acid extraction from infected ticks for future investigation of this type of assay as well as tick-human interface research. This bank will be of commercial value. Upon the completion of Phase2, we will be in a position to provide a tick-microbial diagnostic service for researchers, physicians, public health entities, private and individual citizen sectors. This will be an important tool in management of Lyme and related tick-borne diseases for improved medical treatment and public health surveillance. It will also be the foundation for doing the same in patient skin, blood, joint fluid, and cerebrospinal fluid. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ability to accurately identify multiple pathogens in the ticks capable of causing Lyme disease and related disorders will be important in management strategy of patients exposed or bitten by ticks. It will help reduce rising costs to the patient and the public health system.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The World Health Organization estimates that over 1,600 people die each hour from an infectious disease, half of whom are children under 5 years of age. Infectious diseases account for 26 percent of total global mortality and are the third leading cause of death in the United States. In addition to microbial identification for clinical response, diagnostics are also needed for a wide range of applications including food and water safety, bioreactor analysis, sterility assurance in the pharmaceutical industry, environmental microbiology, and homeland security. The focus of this research is to develop and characterize a microbial identification platform using very rapid MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry of modified ribosomal RNA fragments. By generating base-specific RNA fragments optimized for mass spectrometric characterization, we have shown that  organism-pure  samples such as single colonies and clones can be identified in ca. 1.5 hours. The platform is  open  in that it can identify any bacterial organism that has been previously sequenced without the a priori design of sequence specific nucleic acid probes. Furthermore, the assay is more rapid than nucleic acid sequencing and amenable to identification of organisms in biological mixtures and determination of their relative abundances. Finally, pathogens can be identified against an uninteresting background of commensal organisms or host nucleic acids. We plan to build on our promising system for general bacterial identification by improving our techniques for nucleic acid fractionation based upon relative organism abundance, heuristic approaches, and clonal PCR for organism-mixture analysis. The anticipated result of this study will be a rapid, first response system capable of high-throughput microbial community analysis of a variety of sample types. Including nucleic acid isolation, data acquisition and analysis, ca. 384 analyses should be feasible in less about 5 hours. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rapid response to infectious disease requires that the analytical procedures employed are inherently fast. Compared to most analytical techniques, mass spectrometry is generally faster, providing both separation of complex mixtures and a fundamental measurement simultaneously. In addition to microbial identification for clinical response, diagnostics are also needed for a wide range of applications including food and water safety, bioreactor analysis and sterility assurance, and environmental microbiology. This project focuses on developing a total platform system for microbial identification using predictive software, novel molecular techniques, and mass spectral analysis of ribosomal RNA fragments.",

Diabetes is currently believed to afflict over 100 million people worldwide and nearly 18 million in the United States. In the U.S. this disorder, along with its associated complications, is ranked as the seventh leading cause of death. Research indicates that these long-term complications can be minimized in diabetics if blood glucose levels are maintained as near normal levels (60-110 mg/dL) as possible, so called  tight  glucose control. The integration of continuous glucose monitor readings into an automatic insulin pump control algorithm may substantially increase both the safety and effectiveness of insulin therapy in diabetics. BioTex, Inc. has developed a superior fluorescence affinity glucose sensor which is one of the most promising technologies currently being pursued for application in diabetes research and therapy. The objective this Phase II proposal is to commence human clinical studies with the sensor under an investigational device exemption (IDE) from the FDA. The anticipated outcome will be a thorough characterization of the optimal implantation, instrumentation, and use of the sensor in humans and refinements of the associated accessories and procedures. At the end of this project we will be poised to commence larger human clinical trials in support of a pre-market approval (PMA) application to the FDA for marketing a 3-5 day implantable continuous glucose sensing system. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: BioTex, Inc. has successfully developed a minimally-invasive fluorescence affinity sensor (FAS) for continuous glucose monitoring over 3-5 days. The FAS has a number of advantages over currently available short-term implantable glucose sensors and is expected be a significant tool for diabetes research and therapy. Diabetes currently afflicts over 100 million people worldwide and nearly 18 million in the United States, and this disorder, along with its associated complications, is ranked as the seventh leading cause of death.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a proposal to build an on-demand assistance service atop the existing mobile phone infrastructure. Something like a GM OnStar service for the Blind and Low-vision,  Sight on Call  will provide help from a remote, distributed assistant workforce. With this project, Blindsight will bring a new capability to the blind and moderate low-vision market. The impact on the lives of the millions of low-vision and elderly, if the project meets it goals, will be significant - an entirely new option for getting assistance on-demand, and at reasonable cost. Users of the system will speak to live operators while sending images of their surroundings and GPS location information via a camera equipped cell phone. Sighted operators can then assist in a wide range of mobility and orientation tasks such as finding a bus stop or street address, as well as many daily tasks such as shopping and paying bills. Phase I of the project will entail building and testing a prototype of the system. The system will be considered feasible if subjects are able to complete a range of tasks with the prototype within demanding predefined time limits and if a majority of them report that having the device represents a significant advantage (in terms of time, stress or discomfort) over being forced to rely on other alternative methods. In Phase II all key components of the service will be developed and tested including cell phone software, remote service center infrastructure, operator hiring and training, interaction protocol development and operator console development. At each stage automation will be introduced when possible to increase operator productivity and lower cost. 60 human subjects will then carry out large scale real world testing with the developed system. This will drive additional development and testing to maximize operator efficiency and user satisfaction. Once proved feasible, a full-scale service bureau providing the Sight on Call service is planned to launch within 6 months of the end of the proposed project period. Estimated cost for the premium service, targeting affluent seniors with moderate to severe low vision, is under  1 per minute of use, based on current call center cost metrics. In parallel, a volunteer-based distributed service is proposed, which can provide the same service at an estimated cost of  30/month for unlimited use. The project is of interest to the health care venture capital community if and when certain milestones are achieved.",

The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project objective is to commercialize a novel technology for indexing video. The company's approach automatically integrates information from speech, text, and video through algorithms that generate rich semantic indexes for video. The Phase I results show that this approach can be incorporated into a system that indexes video with high accuracy and at a fraction of the cost of currently used methods. Further, during the Phase I research, the company has identified a large and growing consumer market (sports video) in which the technology can be applied.  The technical objectives of the Phase II proposal focus on working with such partners to roll out initial Bluefin-powered applications, such as content-based search and video-enriched fantasy sports. Such applications are currently not feasible because of the low accuracy of automated indexing methods and the high cost of manual approaches to indexing video.  Millions of hours of new video content are coming online every month, feeding an exploding demand and reshaping the nature of the Internet. Just as text-oriented search engines were necessary to empower users to find what they needed during the first phase of the text-centric Internet, a new generation of technology will be necessary to organize and effectively find content in the fast-approaching video-dominated era of the Internet. Bluefin Lab is pioneering a new approach to video organization and search by commercializing cross-modal algorithms developed in Academe. While this differentiated technology can be leveraged in several target markets, the company's initial focus is on sports media where it will power a unique experience for video search, video-enhanced fantasy sports, and other video-centric applications.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Anemia is a frequent finding in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is present in over 90% of CKD patients with end-stage renal disease. Anemia typically results from inability of the diseased kidney to produce erythropoietin (EPO), which stimulates production of red blood cells. Anemia leads to fatigue, a decreased quality of life and correlates with increased mortality in CKD patients. Recombinant EPO is effective at reversing anemia in about 90% of CKD patients. Recombinant EPO products had worldwide sales of  11.6 billion in 2006 and are the single most expensive renal disease medicine in terms of total product sales. EPO has a short circulating half- life and generally is administered to patients two to three times per week. Bolder BioTechnology has created a highly potent, long-acting EPO analog that has a significantly increased circulating half-life and superior efficacy in animal erythropoiesis models compared to EPO. Based upon animal studies we anticipate that our long-acting EPO analog will be effective when administered once every 4-8 weeks in humans. The improved in vivo characteristics of this novel EPO analog will reduce the need for frequent injections, improve patient quality of life and potentially lead to improved therapeutic efficacy. Our long-acting EPO analog has the potential to significantly reduce healthcare costs by reducing the amount of drug required by patients, by reducing costs associated with patient visits to treatment centers and by reducing healthcare worker time associated with providing treatments. Because of its unique structure, manufacturing costs for our long-acting EPO analog are anticipated to be significantly less than for other EPO products. The goal of this proposal is to develop this long-acting EPO analog for the treatment of anemia associated with CKD. During Phase I of this proposal, we optimized the manufacturing process and developed and validated supporting assay methods to produce material for GLP (Good Laboratory Practices) pharmacology and toxicology studies. During Phase I we also designed clinical protocols for Phase 1 safety and Phase 2 dose ranging efficacy studies in humans. The main goal of the Phase II SBIR proposal is to complete the animal toxicology and pharmacology studies required by the FDA prior to testing this product in humans. Successful development of our long-acting EPO analog will provide CKD patients with a longer-acting, significantly less expensive alternative for the effective management of anemia. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recombinant erythropoietin (EPO) is widely used to ameliorate anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease, which affects 20- 40 million people in the United States. EPO typically is administered to patients by twice weekly or thrice weekly injections due to its short half-life in people. We created longer acting and more potent EPO analogs that may potentially reduce the amount of EPO required per patient, improve patient safety, compliance and quality of life, and result in considerable cost savings to patients and healthcare providers. The goals of this Phase II grant proposal are to manufacture the protein under GLP (Good Laboratory Practices) conditions and measure the safety profile and pharmacokinetic properties of the protein in animal pharmacology and toxicology studies, which are required by the FDA prior to testing the compound in humans.",

The output of the spectral engine will be fed into a spatial engine, where a second SLM will be used to generate two dimensional scenes.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Biologically and clinically relevant proteomic data can only be generated if organ or tissue samples investigated consist of homogeneous cell populations, in which no unwanted cells of different types and/or development stages obscure the results. One of the main problems with the analysis of tissue samples is the heterogeneous nature of the sample. Many different cell types are typically present in tissue biopsies, and in the case of diseased tissue small numbers of abnormal cells may lie within or adjacent to unaffected areas. Thus, the laser capture/microdissection process has been developed to provide a rapid and straightforward method for procuring homogeneous subpopulations of cells or structures for biochemical and molecular biological analyses. However, current proteomic techniques, including two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, multidimensional liquid chromatography systems, and gel and gel-free isoelectric focusing approaches such as chromatofocusing, immobilized pH membranes, Rotofor, free-flow electrophoresis, and off-gel electrophoresis, are all operated at the preparative-scale and are incompatible with small cell populations collected from microdissection-procured specimens. Our research goal is therefore to integrate the Gemini proteomic platform with tissue microdissection/preparation techniques as a novel biomarker discovery paradigm for enabling comprehensive and comparative survey of protein expression profiles in targeted cell populations isolated from clinical tissue specimens. The obvious progression in the development, evaluation, and validation of proposed biomarker discovery paradigm includes (i) the implementation of high throughput Gemini proteomic platform using a multiplexed nano-reversed-phase liquid chromatography system, (ii) full assessment of Calibrant's unique tissue proteome capabilities toward comparative characterization of protein expression profiles within microdissected tumor cells of glioma malignancies, and (iii) confirmation of discriminate biomarker candidates among different grades of glioma malignancies using Western blot and immunohistochemistry techniques on a large series of additional tissue specimens. In addition to the clinical proteomic technology development and validation, Phase II efforts will also focus on the identification of disease markers, exploration of molecular relationships among different disease states and phenotypes, and a deeper understanding of molecular mechanisms that drive disease progression.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our research goal is to integrate the Gemini proteomic platform emerging from the Phase I project with tissue microdissection/preparation techniques as a novel biomarker discovery paradigm for enabling comprehensive and comparative survey of protein expression profiles in targeted cell populations isolated from clinical tissue specimens.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The CardioMetrix Endoluminal HF Monitoring System is intended to provide patients with ambulatory monitoring their heart function, allowing for better management of their disease and allowing them to live a life less encumbered by HF. The system uses ultrasound to determine pulmonary arterial blood pressure and flow. Using these two parameters, calculations are made to determine cardiac dynamics, such as pump power. With these data, physicians and patients will become aware of acute changes in HF and will be able to make earlier changes in HF management and treatment, preventing acute decompensation. The implant is passive, receiving energy and transmitting the flow and pressure data out of the body using RF communications. Therefore, the implant will not require a battery, with limited life, to accomplish these tasks. The implant has 4 ultrasound sensors to determine flow and a separate sensor for measurement of pressure. The sensors will be mounted on a self-expanding frame that will be deployed in the pulmonary artery using standard catheterization techniques during an outpatient procedure. Once deployed, the carrier will provide correct sensor orientation with respect to the blood flow. An external hand-held unit will be used to energize and collect data from the implant, with a display showing pressure, flow and cardiac power, measures of cardiac performance. In phase I of this SBIR, sensor prototypes will be modified to work wirelessly and will be tested acutely in animals. In phase II, a fully functional wireless implant will be developed, fabricated and tested in animals. Development activities include the integration and miniaturization of the circuitry needed to power the endoluminal implant, obtain the flow and pressure data and provide outbound communications of the data. Heart Failure (HF) is a chronic and progressive disease affecting an estimated 5 million Americans and 23-27million people worldwide. Nearly 600,000 new cases are diagnosed annually in the US, and 2.5-3 million are diagnosed worldwide. We propose a novel hemodynamic monitor that may reduce the cost of care, the morbidity, and the mortality of patients with HF.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is in response to Notice Number (NOT-OD-09-058) and Notice Title: NIH Announces the Availability of Recovery Act Funds for Competitive Revision Applications. We propose to adapt for an assisted living environment the Family Connections System (FCS) and Digital Mailbox technology which offer communication tools designed to increase the frequency and type of communications among family members. Frailty and residence within assisted living (AL) are associated with losing social connections, adding to the risk of physical and mental decline, and mortality. The FCS fosters communication between AL residents who are unlikely to be electronically linked, and their community-based network members who rely on electronic communication tools such as email and texting. The original study evaluates the impact of FCS use on communication frequency and range of network members communicating as well as the psychosocial wellbeing of residents and family members. Over 900,000 AL residents in the U.S. have extraordinary potential to benefit from interventions that enhance communication frequency and range of participants.  The proposed competitive revision extends the field trial of the FCS within assisted living in three ways: 1) Creates and pilots a network building intervention for the subgroup of the AL population without community members in their social network. Project staff will help interested residents initiate contact with lost network members to invite them into their FCS communication network. The FCS makes communication so easy, that we believe broader networks can be (re-)activated to communicate regularly. Qualitative interviews with socially impoverished residents will identify strategies for network building. Project staff will assist residents with engaging their new (or re-built) network, and test whether we can grow networks that allow  orphans  to participate in community relationships again. 2) Develop an Activity Modules Guide of multiple activities linking residents to outside social networks. AL facilities are so diverse that a broad range of potential activities are needed to maximize residents' communication with their networks. Modules will be created that provide activity directors with step-by-step instructions for implementing a range of possible activity events that generate communication within residents' FCS networks. A web-based format will be easily accessible to AL staff. 3) Create a User's Guide, a critical component of deployment in AL settings. The User's Guide (UG) can be created from the procedures used to install and operate the FCS in the three AL test sites of the existing project. The UG will document the detailed steps that each site needs to follow in creating an operational FCS within AL. The UG will be developed to be delivered in small manageable sections through a staff website which will be built specifically for their use.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Residents of assisted living have extraordinary potential to benefit from interventions that enhance their social networks and rates of contact because their social losses have negative effects on physical and mental health. This project tests the impact of an innovative technology that links elders' paper and pencil communications with network members' computerized communication tools. The revised project adds infrastructure to support implementation in assisted living facilities by creating novel activities that use the technology, a User's Guide that is integrated with the web-based operation to support staff users, and a pilot intervention to build social networks for elders who lack connections external to the facility.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project focuses on the development of patented antimicrobial compounds to provide superior infection control to textiles. 5-10% of patients admitted to hospitals in the US acquire an infection while in hospital.  Consequences of hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) include prolonged hospital stays, increased treatment costs, and cause more than 100,000 deaths each year. The financial costs of these infections run into billions of dollars annually. Laboratory and clinical studies have shown that bacteria can survive for weeks on items found in patient rooms, which are suspected of playing a role in the transmission of pathogens. This program continues the development an innovative fabric finish to create textiles that will kill microbes on contact.  The performance of these compounds has been shown to be superior to current non-leaching antimicrobial technologies. The biocide is chemically attached to fabric using a water-based solution. Chemical immobilization of the antimicrobial agent minimizes migration into the environment. During Phase II, the efficacy of treated fabrics will be assessed against pathogens, including strains associated with HAIs.  Physical characterization of the fabrics will be performed to determine the effects of laundering. Finally, the\neffectiveness of treated fabrics in the clinic will be demonstrated.  The number of hospital acquired infections (HAIs) is increasing, with a larger proportion being caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria.  Policy changes of cost reimbursement related to HAIs have already been implemented, placing the burden on hospitals to prevent such infections. Inevitably, infection control policies within hospitals will be expanded in order to reduce rates of infection. Creating actively biocidal surfaces will provide a new method of infection control, augmenting current practices without significantly adding to the workload of staff.  In this program, novel antimicrobial technology is being developed for use on fabrics. Ultimately, it is expected that strategic deployment of this technology as a complement to hand-hygiene (the most important component of infection control) will reduce the number of HAIs, improve patient outcomes and reduce the costs of healthcare.  Other commercial textile applications of this technology include protective garments for military personnel, emergency responders, and fabrics for sports apparel.  The antimicrobial product may also be applied to non-textile items, such as computer keyboards and bedrails.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long term goal is the development of better, longer hypothermic storage conditions, using novel insect antifreeze proteins, for liver transplants than is currently possible in clinical practice. The use of hypothermia as the principal means to suppress metabolism in a reversible way is the foundation of most of the effective methods for tissue and organ storage. Hypothermic injury results in vascular dysfunction during liver storage, therefore vascular tissue models were employed in our Phase I SBIR proposal. Blood vessel rings studies could be performed with the small quantities of recombinant insect-derived antifreeze proteins available with our existing manufacturing methods. A recently discovered insect-derived antifreeze protein formulation was tested sub-zero at -100C and at +40C, to detect antifreeze protein concentration dependent cytotoxicity effects, and compared with controls without antifreeze proteins in order to increase the duration of hypothermic storage. The test temperature, -100C, was selected on the basis of the greater non-colligative freezing point depression produced by the insect antifreeze peptides that provide almost an order of magnitude greater activity compared with other previously described antifreeze proteins derived from other sources. The results demonstrate that our lead antifreeze protein formulation consisting of equal amounts of Dendroides canadensis types 1, 2, 4 and an activity enhancing thaumatin-like protein resulted in preservation of fresh tissue function control values for 3-6 days at -10:C, while tissues stored at +4:C demonstrated statistically significant changes compared with both fresh controls and the -10:C storage group. Consistent storage of tissues without the antifreeze proteins at -10:C was not possible because ~30% of the samples froze. The insect-derived antifreeze proteins inhibited ice nucleation at -100C permitting mammalian tissue storage at much lower levels of endogenous metabolic activity. These results demonstrate proof of feasibility for sub-zero storage of mammalian tissues. In this Phase II SBIR application scale up of antifreeze protein manufacturing and optimization of longer, better storage procedures for mammalian livers are proposed. The above antifreeze combination tested in Phase I, plus additional insect-derived antifreeze protein formulations selected from prior research studies on antifreeze protein activity by our consultant, Professor John Duman, and controls will be compared in four specific aims employing tissue and liver models of increasing complexity and relevance for human liver transplantation. Each model will be evaluated using a panel of assays and histopathology to determine relative function after storage. The antifreeze protein formulations will be tested at -100C and controls will be tested with a currently employed clinical organ storage solution at +40C. In parallel with these aims scale up of antifreeze protein production to achieve the quantities required for storage of large mammal livers, both porcine and human, will be performed by Professor Duman's laboratory. His group will also validate the batches as they are being produced. These studies should lead to longer hypothermic, sub-zero storage periods for tissues and organs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Livers destined for transplantation are currently stored using static cold storage in a chemically defined solution at 4:C for periods of up to 6 hours. However, the application of static cold storage has proven to be insufficient to fulfill the organ demand for patients with irreversible liver failure, because marginal livers can not be preserved optimally, for long enough, by static cold storage to permit organ evaluation to occur. These limitations should be overcome by use of a lower, sub-zero hypothermic temperature (-10:C) to further reduce metabolism in combination with insect-derived antifreeze proteins to inhibit ice nucleation. This may result in increased availability of organs for transplant.",

        "abstract": "Although most power produced in the U.S. comes from coal, the environmental footprint of coal has made it difficult to site and build new plants.  Many new options for coal power generation involve techniques to capture CO2 emissions, but these often require additional costly and inefficient process steps.  A simple, efficient technology for directly converting coal to power while producing a pure CO2 stream would preserve coal\u00bfs place in the U.S. power generation mix and enhance energy security.  This project will develop a direct coal-power-generation concept by using the Liquid Tin Anode Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (LTA-SOFC), which has the potential for converting coal to electric power at very high efficiency while capturing CO2.  In Phase I, several feasible cell designs were developed for scaling the LTA-SOFC to the required size for utility applications.  In Phase II, experimental work will focus on evaluating the durability of the technique in a coal environment.  In these experiments, long term testing of the LTA-SOFC will establish the impact of coal contaminants on the electrolyte and other cell components.  Techniques to eliminate any observed failure modes will be developed. Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The LTA-SOFC should significantly improve the environmental footprint of coal power production.  The projected efficiency of over 60%, with CO2 capture, would be higher than any other advanced coal technology.  The LTA-SOFC also could be used to efficiently generate power from biomass and other renewable resources \u00bf because the technology is scalable, the LTA\u00adSOFC could be deployed as a distributed generation resource, improving access to renewable fuels while providing power generation close to the point of use.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is directed at development of a high performance, programmable fast Fourier transform (FFT) circuit for use in embedded signal processing integrated circuits. Over the last 40 years the technology for executing parallel FFT implementations has remained relatively unchanged, being based essentially on different permutations of the signal flow graph and mappings thereof. Performance improvements are now largely achieved by shrinking circuit geometries according to Moore's Law. Because of the limits imposed by physics of integrated circuit fabrication, it is expected that continued improvement in signal processing will only be achieved with more efficient algorithmic implementations in combination with advanced integrated circuit technologies. This proposal focusses on a radically different architecture for parallel FFT circuits based on a new matrix formulation of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) to achieve exactly this goal. The specific advantages of this new formulation include: 1) logic and memory resource requirements are reduced; 2) less power is consumed; 3) significant added functionality is accrued; and 4) design, test, and maintenance efforts are diminished because the circuits are simple, locally connected and structured. The outcomes of this project is a commercial quality FFT circuit based on the feasibility prototypes developed during SBIR Phase I.  The DFT sub-system is a critical and important component of\nlarge number of real-time communications, radar, medical, acoustics, navigation, surveillance, remote sensing, and robotic inspection applications and is arguably the most prominent of all signal processing algorithms. Consequently, the availability of more functional, efficient, and higher performance FFTs will significantly improve the efficacy of a host of electronic products. The benefits of this new FFT technology would be best suited to mobile wireless devices, the largest and fastest growing market for electronic products, because future 4G wireless protocols will be based on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing, which is a scheme that makes use of the FFT. Consequently, most wireless devices of the future will use embedded FFT circuitry. However, the computational demands to support 4G communication requirements will increase by a factor of ~10 compared to today's wireless mobile devices. Therefore, more efficient integrated circuit implementations of FFTs will be required to continue to keep the cost and power usage of mobile appliances low.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Microfluidic technologies are an excellent candidate to achieve the goal set forth by NHGRI to reduce the total sequencing cost by two- or four-orders of magnitude from the current cost of sequencing a human-sized genome. Microfluidic chips enable highly reduced use of the sample/reagent and integration of all sequencing steps from sample preparation to separation and detection into a single analytical instrument. Current chip design methods rely primarily on trial-and-error experiments or employ prohibitively expensive high-fidelity computational analysis. These approaches are time consuming, costly, and require experimental or numerical modeling expertise that cannot be expected of chip designers and manufacturers. In addition, the lack of direct interfacing between design analysis tools and microfabrication processes leads to additional cost and delay in the development of functional prototypes. There is a clear and unmet need for design tool that can deliver multi-functional microfluidic prototypes with superior performance at a low cost and fast turn-around times. We propose to develop a novel, integrated, paradigm-transforming microfluidic design toolkit, based on system- level simulation and reduced-order model methodology to enable rapid simulation, optimization, and prototyping of next-generation microfluidic systems for genomic analysis. In Phase II, we will develop multi-physics, reduced-order models for liquid filling, genomic sample extraction and purification, and DNA hybridization, which in conjunction with our models of electrophoresis and PCR in Phase I will establish a self-contained, complete design capability for critical microfluidic genomic applications. Constraint-based optimizers using nonlinear programming will be developed for rapid chip design. Interfaces bridging the design-microfabrication gap will be developed and expanded to accommodate both maskless and mask-based fabrications. Novel functionalities and capabilities will be incorporated into the development of the integrated design environment for improved ease-of-use, integration, and automation. Through industrial and academic collaboration, we will validate and demonstrate the proposed prototyping methodology by developing optimized design of genomic microchips for microfluidic PCR and DNA separation and sequencing. Beyond Phase II, we will carry out software engineering and packaging activities and optimize the toolkit performance in terms of execution efficacy, reliability, interface diversity, and ease-of-use for commercial release and sales in partnership with Intellisense Corp. An experienced, multi-disciplinary team with expertise in all aspects of the proposed study - reduced-order modeling and simulation, optimization, software development, microfluidic fabrication and testing has been assembled for successful completion of the Phase II research. The developed design tool will have critical applications in microfluidics, life sciences, biomedical and biodefense arena. The proposed effort will beneficially impact the genomic analysis and diagnostics community in terms of shrinking the overall RandD cycles (from concepts to optimized physical prototype within ~days) and reducing the cost via elimination of trial-and-error-based design and manual transfer of the layout information to the microfabrication process. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project is to develop a novel, integrated, paradigm-transforming microfluidic design tool to enable rapid simulation, optimization, and prototyping of next-generation microfluidic systems for genomic analysis. The Phase II end-product will find applicability in the microfluidic/integrated biomicrosystem section of the overall biotechnology market, engaged in life science research.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Leptospirosis is a life-threatening zoonotic infection that causes acute renal failure and pulmonary hemorrhage. In the US, human leptospirosis is an emerging disease due to outbreaks that have occurred during disasters and sporting events and the increase in travel and recreation-related exposures. Furthermore, leptospirosis is a  neglected  disease which imparts it largest burden in populations of urban slum dwellers and subsistence farmers. More than one million cases of leptospirosis are reported each year, mostly from developing countries. Mortality from severe clinical forms of the disease is gt10%. In several regions leptospirosis has emerged as the major cause of hemorrhagic fever. The critical need in addressing leptospirosis is a rapid diagnostic test that can enable clinicians to make effective decisions on therapy and management. Antimicrobial therapy, when administered early in the illness, can prevent disease progression and mortality. Timely diagnosis requires a laboratory test since the clinical presentation of early-phase leptospirosis is non-specific and often confused as being dengue or other cases of an acute febrile illness. Yet currently available tests have inadequate sensitivity (lt50%) in detecting early-phase leptospirosis. Our Phase I studies have demonstrated the feasibility of developing a high-performing rapid test for leptospirosis. We have identified novel diagnostic targets, Leptospira immunoglobulin-like (Lig) proteins, which are the immunodominant antigens recognized by antibodies during infection. We have applied recombinant Lig fragments to an innovative proprietary immunoassay format, the Dual Path Platform (DPP ), and found that a DPP prototype had an overall sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 90% in evaluations of samples from leptospirosis patients from Brazil and Thailand. Furthermore, the DPP prototype had a sensitivity of 78% in identifying leptospirosis in the first 7 days of illness, the  window-of- opportunity  during which initiation of antimicrobial therapy provides greatest benefit. In this Phase II application we propose to develop and evaluate a rapid diagnostic test for leptospirosis which will have required characteristics for general use worldwide. The specific aims are to: 1) develop and optimize assay design, 2) determine diagnostic test performance in a multicenter evaluation, and 3) validate test production protocols in preparation for regulatory approval. We expect that a developed and fully validated assay will have major beneficial consequences for clinical practices worldwide by allowing physicians to make a point-of-care diagnosis and initiate timely therapeutic interventions which are required to prevent the high mortality associated with leptospirosis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There is no effective prevention for human leptospirosis, a life-threatening emerging zoonotic disease, whose global burden is estimated to be as high as 500,000 cases annually. Untreated leptospirosis often progresses to multi-organ failure and/or pulmonary hemorrhage, and prompt diagnosis and early initiation of antibiotic therapy are the key intervention to prevent the morbidity and mortality associated with these complications. The research proposed here aims to develop a rapid point-of-care diagnostic test for leptospirosis which would enable antibiotic therapy to be initiated during the acute phase of the infection, when it is most effective. As part of the proposed Phase II study, we will conduct clinical evaluations of the rapid diagnostic test in preparation for regulatory approval.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In vitro assays that reliably correlate with observed clinical drug-drug interactions (DDIs) facilitate drug development and safety testing and reduce reliance on animal testing. One important mechanism of DDI is the in\nteraction of drugs with transport proteins in various tissues, including intestine, kidney, liver, brain and placenta. The human intestinal cell line, Caco-2, is widely used by academic, governmental and pharmaceutical labs to study drug transporters, but \ninterpretation of the results is hampered by the expression of multiple drug efflux transporters in these cells. Chemical inhibitors of transporters are available and are used to partially dissect transport mechanisms. Unfortunately, currently available in\nhibitors are not totally specific, creating ambiguities in data interpretation. Knockdown of gene expression by interfering RNA is much more specific; therefore, transport assays employing Caco-2 cells in which a given transporter has been knocked down by \ncontinuous presence of RNAi targeted to that message have the potential of yielding specific and unambiguous transport results. In Phase I we used lentiviral-mediated short hairpin RNAi constructs targeted at drug efflux transporter sequences to construct \nCaco-2 knockdown cell lines and appropriate vector controls. We characterized the differentiation state, knockdown phenotype stability and drug transport properties of the constructs and determined that they met the success criteria spelled out in the Phas\ne I application. In Phase II we propose to optimize the growth media for the various cell lines, scale-up the manufacture of assay plates and determine the stability of the cell lines to frozen storage. In addition we propose to develop and validate fluore\nscence-based assays for characterization of cell transporter function and to develop novel assay systems for monitoring the interaction of apical and basolateral transporters present in these cell lines. Successful completion of this Phase II grant will al\nlow us to provide pre-plated assay plates or license these human knockdowns cells to academic, governmental and industrial labs that wish to study DDI's using an assay format compliant with the recommendations of the 2006 FDA draft guidance on in vitro tes\nting for DDIs.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It has been estimated that roughly 2.8% of all hospitalizations are a result of drug-drug interactions (DDIs). The intent of this project is to develop new in vitro research tools that provide superior predict\nion of DDIs mediated by drug transport proteins in humans. In Phase I of this project we successfully created human intestinal cell lines that produce more specific DDI assays by reducing the expression of unwanted human drug transport proteins. In Phase I\nI of the project we propose optimizing and scaling up these cell-based assay systems so that they can be made available to academic, governmental and industrial research labs involved in investigating DDIs and improving drug safety.",

A rigorous and formal specification of the semantics of OWL-based ICs will also be delivered.\n\nThe goal of Phase II works is to address two primary use cases:1) validation of data sources that are of arbitrary size and complexity, with arbitrary numbers of constraints, and non-trivial update rates; 2) validation of messages exchanged in Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) and Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) systems, where data sizes are relatively small but message throughput may be high and data validation times must be short. We will also develop a plugin for the popular ontology editor Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 that will help users author and validate ICs.",

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase II project develops software products to improve software quality and developer productivity. Computers are used everywhere in our lives with most applications requiring high reliability, availability, and security. Despite efforts to improve quality, bugs are still too common and costly.  To address these problems the team has conducted research in static-analysis and bug detection - taking a pattern-based approach - applying data-mining to software code analysis.  The Phase II effort will focus on integration of the tools into the software development lifecycle providing customers an optimal way to benefit from the tools. The team will also develop needed functionality (Branch Quality Management, Patch-Mining) and code search - all new, unique, broader and important usages of technology identified by customers from Phase I.  The tools, once commercialized, can benefit a large percentage of IT departments in different business segments (IT, finance, government, entertainment, insurance, etc) to improve their software quality and productivity and reduce the software development cost via automatic bug detection. In contrast to traditional manual effort that usually takes a programmer 1-2 weeks to detect a bug, the proposed tools can easily identify hundreds of bugs in millions lines of code automatically in 1-2 hours. Once a bug is detected (either from these tools, or any other tools, the tools can be used to ensure that the bug-fix is applied throughout the code.  In addition to detecting software bugs, the proposed tools can also be used to detect illegal software plagiarism from open source or other software.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The objective is to design, build, and clinically assess ParkinTune?, an advanced wireless movement disorder monitor technology to augment stimulation programming (tuning) involved in deep brain stimulation (DBS) procedures for Parkinson's Disease (PD). Major PD symptoms that affect quality of life include tremor, bradykinesia, and rigidity. While the exact mechanism that fuels DBS clinical success stories remains unclear, the procedure has been shown to effectively relieve PD motor symptoms when medication is no longer effective. However, clinicians lack tools that combine physiological, electrical, and behavioral data to optimize electrode placement and stimulator programming. Optimizing electrode placement and stimulator parameters improves the amount of motor symptom reduction patients receive and minimizes complications. The current standard in evaluating symptoms is the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), a qualitative ranking system. A battery of exercises, typically a subset of the upper extremity motor section of the UPDRS, is normally completed during DBS electrode placement surgery and subsequent programming sessions to evaluate performance while a clinician qualitatively assesses symptoms. CleveMed has previously developed a compact wireless system to quantify movement disorder symptoms called ParkinSense?. This previously existing technology will serve as the hardware platform for this proposed program. While previous work has shown excellent results to objectively quantify symptoms during a clinical exam, this proposed project will integrate several new features for real-time assistance with DBS surgery electrode placement and stimulation programming. The clinically deployable ParkinTune system resulting from this proposed Fast-Track application will provide a compact wireless system for use in the operating room and outpatient follow up programming sessions that maximizes patient safety and comfort. The objective biokinetic data transmitted during electrode placement and subsequent programming will be input to algorithms that output a continuous scale of objective PD symptom severity in real-time to guide clinician decision making. The improved resolution and repeatable results of the ParkinTune system should reduce time and costs of DBS procedures as well as optimize patient outcomes.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The business of developing, testing, and approving new medical treatments for use in the U.S. has changed dramatically over the past 10 years. In recent years we have observed declining approvals, increasing costs, increasing regulatory process complexity, doubling of the number of new treatments being tested, and slowing of U.S. based recruitment. Together these forces have contributed to a significant increase in time to market for needed therapies.     We believe that the current regulatory requirements for conducting clinical trials are preventing small companies from testing many potentially beneficial therapies due to a lack of resources to conduct this testing. A new, simplified, cost effective technology solution is needed that will allow small research organizations to setup and conduct a clinical trial at an affordable price. If this new technology is based on time-tested standard computer driven processes, it will significantly increase the acceptability of data submissions to the FDA and file transfers to partner organizations.     Small researchers also tend not to have IT departments or large data centers to run these types of systems. To ensure the solution can be economically deployed, configured and integrated it should be provided through a Web browser using a Software as a Service (SaaS) model with a data model based on Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC).      C-TASC is in a strong position to deliver this technology with a sustainable competitive advantage due to the experience and intellectual capital we have gained through years of managing these types of studies, our experience in developing Web-based technology to manage clinical trials, and our recent addition of technology leadership that has developed similar Web-based SaaS solutions for other large markets.       Creation of this technology will enable small research organizations to affordably conduct studies in a manner consistent with FDA standards, would speed many therapies to market and, in some cases, allow a therapy to come to market that would not have been affordable in the past.",

        "abstract": "Charged particles accelerators are important tools in the study of fundamental properties of matter and energy.  The accelerators often cost billions of dollars; yet, they are only as effective as the detectors in them.  Man made (CVD) diamond combines unusual radiation hardness with the ultimate in charge carrier mobility to enable far superior detectors.  Thus, this project will develop a method for joining single crystal man-made diamond into a large area mosaic, providing for the first time low cost high performance large area diamond detectors.  Diamond detectors exhibit tissue equivalence- a property important for accurate radiation dose monitoring. Charged particle radiation therapy (such as Proton therapy) is found effective in prolonging life and leading to recovery in cancer patients. The proposed detectors are anticipated to improve the precision of this treatment thereby improving survival rates.   Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  High quality diamond offers unusual ability to provide electronic functionality at extremely high temperature. Large area single crystal may ultimately enable a wide array of superior electronics. First to benefit will likely be high temperature electronics such as in power grid management and conversion applications. Other common high power density electronic products such as millimeter wave telecommunication devices, civilian and military radars will also benefit",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Novel Restorative Therapy for Spinal Cord Injury Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating traumatic CNS disorder that significantly disables about 253,000 Americans where two-thirds of the new victims are under the age of 30. Functional deficits following SCI result from damage to axons or severance cutting of axons, loss of neurons and glia, and demyelination. SCI pathology is determined not only by the initial mechanical insult, but also by secondary processes including ischemia, free-radical formation, inflammation, and excitotoxicity. Currently, there is no cure for SCI, and methylprednisolone is the only choice in the clinic, and it lacks FDA approval. Clearly, novel therapies are urgently needed to maximally reduce the disastrous outcome and more effectively improve neurological functions following SCI. Cognosci has developed the COG series of anti-inflammatory/neuroprotective peptides, which are derived from the receptor-binding region of apolipoprotein E (apoE). Our Phase I study established proof-of-principle that our parent peptide, COG133, significantly promoted functional recovery and decreased histopathological lesion size in a mouse model of compressive injury of human SCI. We exceeded our aims by finding that COG compounds are both neuroprotective and neurorestorative and appear to be promoting remyelination. Our intensive studies revealed that apoE-based COG peptides exert significant bioactivities relevant to eliminate the secondary damage and foster the recovery of SCI in the following possible pathways: (1) anti-inflammation; (2) anti-excitotoxicity and reducing intracellular Ca2+ overload; (3) reducing the production of free radical species and nitric oxide; (4) promoting the reconstruction of myelin and protecting oligodendrocytes. This Phase II proposal will capitalize on the success of our previous work to identify the drug lead for acute SCI by comparison of therapeutic efficacy of three more potent and more drug-like COG compounds in two established models of SCI. Furthermore, we will start the limited preclinical safety and toxicity studies with the identified lead compound in this grant and are planning to complete the entire safety and toxicity profiling in a future Phase II continuation grant, which is required by the FDA for an IND application before proceeding to the human clinical trials. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The completion of this Phase II study will enable us to select one lead candidate for the treatment of acute SCI and to proceed to FDA-required safety/toxicity profiling. To fill the critically unmet need for SCI therapy, COG compounds may represent a new generation of restorative SCI therapeutics with the dual potentials of diminishing neurodegeneration of secondary damage and rebuilding damaged axon and myelin. Considering the debilitating nature of SCI, size of the patient population, and the startling healthcare costs, the current project to develop a novel therapy for SCI has significant personal, social, and economic benefit to SCI victims and their families.",

If the vast western oil shale reserves could be economically and cleanly recovered, the country\u00bfs transportation fuel problems would be alleviated.  Earlier shale surface processes used complicated and costly equipment, released substantial CO2, had high water use, and produced oil that required upgrading.  This project will develop a new surface process technology that is simple and clean, and can be commercialized in a shorter time.  Phase I yielded a unique surface process with high processing capacity, on-site oil upgrading, and near-zero carbon dioxide emissions.  Lower costs resulted from process simplicity, the use of nearby low-cost natural fuels for process energy, the use of hydrogen for upgrading, and very low water use.  Phase II plans include (1) a full pilot-scale demonstration, including shale oil recovery and separation units; (2) a demonstration of technology for upgrading shale oil to transportation fuels; and (3) planning and design for scale-up to a commercial-scale kiln, including the identification of commercialization paths. Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The technology should lead to the commercial production of on-site shale oil, with low water use and near-zero CO2 emissions, for the domestic production of transportation fuels.

        "abstract": "Childhood obesity and overweight continue to be one of the greatest public health threats in the United States (DHHS, 2001; Visscher & Seidel, 2001; Rugg, 2004). Childhood weight and behavior are significant predictors of adult overweight and obesity (Whitaker, 1997; Dietz & Gortmaker, 2001; ACS, 2004). While programs that attempt to address weight issues continue to be developed, the problem continues to grow (CDC, 2006). Changing the behaviors that lead to overweight and obesity is known to be a complex and difficult undertaking. We believe that the game we are proposing can contribute a piece to the puzzle. We are proposing a video game because it will appeal to children. Whether they have any interest or previous awareness of issues related to their weight, they will be attracted to play the game purely because it provides an engaging and entertaining video game experience (NPD, 2005). We are targeting awareness and self-efficacy because they are precursors to behavior change. Awareness is involved in the Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) concepts of behavioral capability and expectations (Bandura, 1998). In the Transtheoretical Model (TTM), awareness relates to consciousness raising, a key process of change (Prochaska, 1992). Self-efficacy is a central construct in SCT and TTM and has been shown to be a strong predictor of physical activity and food-related behavior (Bernier & Avard, 1986; Kelder, Perry, & Klepp, 1993; Marcus, Eaton, Rossi, & Harlow, 1994; Sallis, Prochaska, & Taylor, 2000). By increasing awareness and self-efficacy, our game will provide an easy and inexpensive approach to prepare children for programs that are already in place or being developed for community organizations, such as 4-H, YMCA, YWCA, scouts, church youth programs, ethnic support centers, and government health promotion programs. The game will align with National Health Education Standards and will complement upper elementary school health curriculum, as well as good parenting practices. Children will eagerly play the game because it is entertaining. It will be easy to use and requires no special training or preparation for program leaders, teachers, or parents. The game will be developed to run on computer systems readily available for use in community programs, schools, and in homes.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed project will test a preventive intervention home-study product targeting first-time parents during and after pregnancy. The product is a series of 12 psycho- educational video modules which introduce couples to the importance of positive coparenting support, and assist couples in developing communication and problem- solving skills in the context of coordinating and supporting each others' parenting. The video modules with an accompanying workbook are designed to enhance coparenting support in order to promote positive adjustment to parenthood, enhance parental warmth, and decrease exposure of children to interparental conflict. The intervention's short-term goals include enhanced coparenting cooperation and diminished hostile/competitive behaviors. Medium-term goals include improved parental adjustment, increased parental sensitivity, and diminished parental negativity. The ultimate long-term goal of the intervention product is to reduce child adjustment problems. We will assess the impact of the product on families through a randomized trial described below. Specific Aim 1. The first aim entails the production of the complete product, based on the existing script and the first 2 video modules developed under Phase 1. The video modules combine brief didactic presentations, structured exercises, footage of actual families' interactions, and portrayal of group discussion. An accompanying workbook for each member of the couple will be included with the DVD series, as well as a website available for consumers with extended materials and links for individual follow-up. Before final editing of each module, we will gather feedback from expectant couples. Specific Aim 2. The second aim is to test the product in a randomized controlled trial with 220 couples expecting a first child. After completing pretest measures, the couples will be randomized into control and intervention groups. The intervention couples will receive the product through the mail and will report via a weekly phone call on their viewing of the modules, as well as completion of homework assignments given at the end of each module. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed prevention product will address the heightened strains experienced by parents during the transition to parenthood, and help foster a foundation of positive communication and family management coordination. The focus on improving the coparenting relationship is aimed at decreasing maternal postnatal depression (which is strongly linked to partner support), decreasing hostile couple conflict (which is linked to negative child outcomes), and enhancing parental efficacy and competence.",

        "abstract": "Geothermal energy has the potential to provide a significant source of clean, renewable energy for the United States.  However, for geothermal energy to be economically viable, advanced technologies are needed to enable the transport of geothermal fluids to the surface from depths on the order of 3 to 10 km.  One of the essential components is a motor-lead extension that is capable of delivering high-voltage electricity to electric submersible pumps (ESP) operating in geothermal wells at temperatures ranging from 200 to 300\u00b0C.  This project will demonstrate the performance of cable extensions based on novel inorganic electrical insulations that are capable of long-term, high-voltage, high-temperature operation.  Phase I involved the production and testing of insulated wires produced with high-temperature, inorganic insulations.  The wire insulation used in this work possessed an electrical resistivity eight times higher than currently-used polymer insulations at 250\u00b0C, while also possessing the necessary mechanical strain tolerance needed for spooling and downhole deployment operations.  In Phase II, the electrical insulation and cable design will be optimized.  The high-temperature electrical and mechanical properties will be evaluated to ensure that the products of this work will meet the needs of future geothermal applications.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The technology should be directly applicable to commercial geothermal energy production.  Related commercial applications include the use of the cable in motor windings, downhole heaters for oil recovery, and micro-hole drilling operations.  In addition, high temperature ESP\u00bfs are also used in SAGD (Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage) for the production of heavy oil, and in deepwater offshore HTHP (high temperature high pressure) wells for the production of conventional oil and gas",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project advances the development of an integrated solar energy system which delivers heat and electrical energy to a building's occupants.  At Cool Energy, development continues on the SolarFlowTM System, a solar thermal system for combined heating and electrical power generation from medium-temperature heat energy (100-300\u00fd\u00fdC) captured with evacuated-tube solar thermal collectors. The innovative system design integrates high-performance solar collectors with a novel advanced-materials Stirling engine and controller to use a single solar system to produce electricity and thermal energy for space and water heating.  Economic value to the customer is maximized using an optimizing predictive control system to regulate the delivery of heat and electricity.  Building on the successful Phase I program for selection of advanced engine components and the demonstration of significant electricity production from the engine prototype, the Phase II demonstration program encompasses system integration of the next-generation Stirling engine prototype with the system controller and solar collectors.  The core intellectual merits are the advances in the Stirling engine design (with broader applications than solar power), the implementation of the predictive control system, the integration with the solar collectors for field testing, and the advanced engine and system design tools.  This project supports a technology demonstration that has enormous potential for helping to replace the world's depleting supply of highly polluting fossil fuels with cleaner, sustainable sources of energy. The costs of traditional energy are rising\nrapidly, causing significant hardship to much of the world's population, including in the US.  Disproportionate effects are visited on the poor as the costs of heating fuels and electricity escalate.  Rising carbon emissions threaten ecosystems and human populations worldwide over the coming centuries.  Cost reduction of renewable energy technology is a main driver of this Phase II demonstration project, as only through lowered costs of clean energy will the US and the world be able to attain domestic energy security, economic stability, and environmental responsibility.  Concentrating on market success to enable widespread adoption, Cool Energy has expended a great deal of effort on modeling the economics of the SolarFlow System in various regions of the US.  Further, partnerships have been cultivated with potential customers, distribution partners, manufacturing partners, and investors to build a strong business foundation to foster rapid penetration of this technology into commercial channels upon its successful demonstration.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Coramed is designing a next-generation point-of-care (POC) instrument, the TEG 6500, for monitoring patient hemostasis on demand. The instrument will introduce a completely new technology for monitoring clot formation and breakdown that is well suited for the continuum of settings from inside the hospital, to ambulatory care clinics, physician offices, and patient homes. We believe such a device, one which produces timely and equivalent results regardless of device location or operator, can substantially enhance the standard of care for prothrombotic patients and improve clinical outcomes. The TEG 6500 will be the successor to the widely accepted Thrombelastograph (R) (TEG(R)) Model 5000 Hemostasis System - used to measure all phases and states of patient hemostasis, including a prothrombotic state. The TEG 5000 is a bench-top laboratory instrument that can also be used at POC. However, despite the clinical and commercial success of the system, its configuration precludes general use in some POC locations inside the hospital and in any locations outside the hospital. The sample size and testing complexity require personnel who can perform phlebotomy, are able to pipette, and who are trained in QC and other lab procedures. To expand the use of the system to physician offices and allow accessible screening for ischemic risk and monitoring of anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy, a compact, portable, easy-to-use instrument such as the TEG 6500 is needed. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Monitoring blood coagulation at the point-of-care (POC) has resulted in better patient outcomes and fewer complications. This grant proposes the development of a new model of the Thrombelastograph(R) (TEG(R)) Hemostasis System (TEG 6500), incorporating a novel approach for monitoring the viscoelastic properties of clots during formation and lysis. This device would be appropriate for use inside and outside the hospital, including home monitoring of patients. As a result of its unique ability to capture the entire profile of coagulation, the TEG system has proven beneficial in monitoring and predicting hemostasis risk in hospitalized patients. This capability will reach a market outside hospital labs when a more robust, easier-to-use, and less expensive model is available. The result will be the capability to screen for risk of heart attack and stroke in the physician's office setting, or in clinics and other point of service locations.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women in the United States and is second only to lung cancer as a cause of cancer-related death. Much of the reduced mortality over the past decade can be attributed to early detection and timely medical intervention. Mammography remains the gold standard for breast cancer screening and early detection. Despite its higher initial cost, digital mammography is rapidly becoming the modality of choice, because of its speed, automation and archiving capability. Image quality, however, remains arguably no better than that achieved on older analog systems. We propose a technological innovation that will enhance the quality of digital mammographic images: a stationary anti-scatter grid with high primary transmission and very low scatter-to- primary ratio that will increase image contrast and, thus, facilitate interpretation of the resulting image. Creatv's grid is the result of two technical innovations: a novel, high precision lithographic technique that is superior to conventional x-ray and UV methods, and a proprietary replication technique suitable for high volume production of metal microstructures. The grid can be manufactured at competitive cost and made broadly available to mammography system makers and users. The improvement in image quality will allow radiologists and computer-aided software to make more correct interpretation of the images, leading to a reduced number of false positives and false negatives and saving lives.",

The effort will develop new algorithms to combine implicit and explicit taxonomies to build content networks.  A live feedback loop that uses multivariate test results will be used to adjust and refine clusters of users in order to establish specific parameters which can subsequently be acted on.  Online content publishers aggregate enormous volumes of data about their viewers from web logs, registration systems, third-party web analytics providers and ad-serving systems.  Mostly these systems operate independently with a primary focus on describing what has happened.  Through a deeper analysis, which will be enabled by the current effort, content providers will be able to use this data in more predictive ways.  This in turn will allow content providers a more intelligent tool for serving higher-value content throughout the online experience.  If successful, this will have implication for new rich media services and e-commerce.",

        "abstract": "A major loss of the expensive silicon used in the production of photovoltaic (PV) solar cells occurs at the wafering stage, where as much as 50% of this valuable material ends up as a disposal problem rather than being recycled.  The waste results from the use of a loose abrasive used with the multi-wire slurry saws currently used to cut the silicon wafers; this abrasive contaminates the swarf silicon and eliminates the possibility of recycling this silicon.  This project will develop technology for recycling the swarf silicon via a fixed diamond abrasive process called Fixed Abrasive Slicing Technology (FAST).  In Phase I, silicon was wafered on a FAST machine and the recovered swarf was analyzed.  The swarf was simulated in composition, phase, and particle size, and then processed in a silicon furnace to produce solar grade feedstock.  In Phase II, the processing technology will be scaled-up to demonstrate a clear path to the commercialization of the fixed diamond abrasive slicing of silicon wafers. Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Converting to a recyclable slicing technology would eliminate one of the largest waste streams in PV and reduce the costs and environmental impacts of PV by 50% or more.  The technology should lead to a $30 million business, which could grow by over a factor of 100 as the industry converted to fixed abrasive wafering",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal addresses the need for objective hospital quality ranking tools that are relevant to patients' experiences and customizable to their individual conditions. This need is created by market changes where patients are increasingly being made aware of differences in quality between providers who will improve their odds at success. Medicare, state governments, insurers and several private companies offer information on hospital quality and cost across many conditions and incorporating a variety of data, process and outcomes quality indicators. However, according to investors, bankers, industry analysts and entrepreneurs, comparison tools are still at an embryonic stage. They suffer from limited specificity, low resolution, conflicts of interest and misfit in the patient information finding process. This leads to patient confusion and perceptions that information is meaningless for decision making. PickCare (tm) is a hospital comparison tool that will address gaps that exist in current hospital ranking systems using advanced statistical and econometric models that have never been applied in this space. In phase 1 we developed Pickcare v2.0 in kidney transplantation and showed that: 1) these models improve specificity through customization to patient factors that our analysis unearths are most important; 2) our models improve resolution by using an expanded history of risk factors; 3) the user interface tested with patients/ family communicates the system's improved resolution as differences across hospitals that patients can understand, and its specificity as a message of hope and alternatives. In phase 2 we will expand to Pickcare v3.0 to 1) accommodate user feedback from phase 1, 2) scale to accommodate more treatments beginning with dialysis and 3) further imbed the system in patients' information finding process. The deliverable of Phase 2 will be version 3 of Pickcare to be released on-line for kidney transplantation and tested internally with recruited patients for dialysis. A manuscript describing how the system influences patient choice in kidney transplantation based on analysis of on-line user data will also be submitted for publication.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal addresses the need for user-friendly web-based tools to help patients and their families choose between hospitals based on the quality of care they will receive. The tool is unique in that it is customized to patient conditions, it has high resolution to separate excellent, average and poor hospitals, it addresses patients' motivations to search for hospital information and builds trust by answering their questions independently of insurers or hospitals.",

        "abstract": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).  This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project involves development of real-time algorithms for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) from documents. This real-time recognition (RT/OCR) system, to be fully developed under this SBIR award, performs recognition an order of magnitude faster than current commercial systems and will allow for real-time recognition that can be embedded on a system device and done at the time of capture. The RT/OCR system will also have no loss in recognition accuracy, and will, in fact, be more accurate for complex documents that include color, graphics, and multiple fonts. This technology, when successfully commercialized within Phase II of the SBIR award, could be deployed on every corporate MFP and digital copier device, converting corporate paper to searchable, electronic files and bringing us one step closer to the paperless office. The technology we intend to use in developing this real-time OCR recognition system is based on methods using Intra- and Inter-Frame Machine Learning. The algorithms to be developed are not, in any way, language specific and can run on virtually any platform (e.g. server or handheld device). The basic technology is completely different from the recognition kernels of current commercial OCR recognition systems.  This project is focused on developing revolutionary technology that will take OCR technology to a new level. This\ntechnology is designed to bridge the gap between paper and digital media, a much needed engine for Bill Payment Machine (BMP), document capture and document processing industry. The capture industry will grow to $2.42 billion in 2010, a CAGR of 16.4%. Real-time OCR for automated and semi-automated field coding addresses the needs of an industry that uses $14.5 billion/year of manual labor just in the US. RT/OCR will be part of a solution that addresses manual paper-based indexing for complex documents, potentially saving the industry and the government billions of dollars every year. This recognition technology, after being successfully developed and commercialized within the context of the Phase II research and development, can be generalized and extended to handle real-time video recognition, with application to autonomous vehicle navigation, aids for the visually impaired, and robotic factory automation.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A simple innovative lever propulsion attachment for pushrim wheelchairs will be developed that can bring the advantages of lever propulsion to wheelchair users. The majority of 1.4 million manual wheelchair users in the United States suffer from Repetitive Strain Injuries (RSI) of the shoulders, elbows, and wrists due to the awkward biomechanics of pushrim propulsion. These injuries force users to transition prematurely into power wheelchairs. Disadvantages of power wheelchair use include high cost, reduced transportability, and, most importantly, the loss of therapeutic physical exertion. The health problems of a sedentary lifestyle result. Independent studies have consistently shown that lever propulsion is significantly more efficient than manual pushrim propulsion and avoids the injury mechanisms that result in RSI. However, no lever design has had significant success in the market because they do not have all the features and capabilities required by users. The proposed design utilizes a single lever in front of the user's knees to drive a wheel directly in front of the user's feet. Steering and braking is by a modified bicycle-style interface, with the entire drive unit including the lever and handlebar rotating for steering similar to handcycle attachments for wheelchairs. The device attaches and detaches easily to virtually any wheelchair. The single lever design and interface design will be especially useful for users with limited strength and dexterity. Users with a left/right imbalance, such as stroke survivors, can utilize this design in the rehabilitation of their weaker side. The attachment is fully adjustable to most users. In Phase I, maneuverability, gear change, stability, traction, reliability, weight, cost, and attachment feasibility were successfully demonstrated. Phase II will include the implementation of a gear shifting and forward-reverse shifting system. The steering, drive, control, and attachment systems will be refined. There will also be comprehensive industry standard International Standards Organization (ISO) testing to certify the reliability and safety of the design. Finally, thorough user testing will be performed to verify functionality compared to manual wheelchairs. The simple, inexpensive, and innovative design in combination with the use of existing components, materials, and fabrication techniques will combine to create an entirely new product category. The company also has experience commercializing innovative mobility products. With a strong market position the lever attachment is poised to capture a significant market share of the  800 million dollar wheelchair market. Introduction of this innovative product in the market will stimulate further technical innovation in an industry constrained by antiquated structural and technological paradigms. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: PROJECT NARRATIVE Most of the 1.4 million manual wheelchair users in this country will suffer from Repetitive Strain Injuries (RSI) due to the awkward and inefficient biomechanics of propulsion. Independent studies have consistently shown that the natural and efficient biomechanics of lever propulsion avoids these injury mechanisms. The proposed revolutionary lever drive attachment for manual wheelchairs would be the first practical and affordable product that meets all the maneuverability and functional requirements as defined by users.",

(Danya), proposes to continue development of Caring for Caregivers: Supporting Caregivers of People with Autism Spectrum Disorders (CFC), an innovative, multimedia curriculum designed to support individuals caring for someone with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). A large body of research targets stress reduction and coping skills in caregivers of persons with chronic illnesses and mental disorders. However, little research has yet to be applied to caregivers of individuals with ASD. To meet the needs of autism caregivers, Danya will develop a modular facilitator's guide, workbook, accompanying audiovisual program, Caregiver Connection Web site, and training materials for professionals and paraprofessionals to educate and inform autism caregivers about coping with common stressors associated with providing care for an individual with autism across the lifespan. The overall goal of CFC is to create an innovative psychoeducational curriculum for caregivers of individuals with ASD across the lifespan that centers on problem-focused stress reduction strategies and coping skills. By using CFC, the aim is for caregivers to increase their self-efficacy related to coping skills, while decreasing their rates of stress and burden through effective coping mechanisms. In Phase II, formative research with key autism organizations, expert Advisory Panel members, caregivers, professionals, and paraprofessionals will help to refine the remaining content of the CFC materials. The CFC curriculum will be completed, including the finalization of the facilitator's guide, workbook, audiovisual program, Web site, and training materials. A full- scale evaluation of the entire CFC product will then be conducted with representative caregiver users. Given our established relationships with autism community partners, as well as the progress of the Phase I project, we anticipate CFC will be a unique and engaging product for caregivers that provides needed tools and strategies to reduce caregiver burden and increase caregivers' use of effective coping skills.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Longitudinal data are very common in sociological, behavioral and biomedical researches. The data may come from longitudinal clinical trials, community surveys, family studies or spatial-temporal studies to investigate some health outcomes. The responses are measured repeatedly over a period of time, and it could be either continuous or discrete. Typically, the interest focuses on the impact of some treatment intervention or the pattern of change in response over time. Such data could be very complex when there are multiple levels of data structures. In addition, it is often the case that there exists missing response in the data. In the analysis of longitudinal data, the missing data mechanisms have to be incorporated in order to derive valid results. In the most severe case, the missing mechanism is not ignorable, i.e. one has to model simultaneously the observed and unobserved outcome variables and the missing indicator. On the other hand, those modeling assumptions are often not testable, and one has to rely on the sensitivity analysis and graphical methods to study the robustness of the assumptions. We are interested in developing software that incorporates the analytic methods, sensitivity analysis and graphical methods in one software. Such software is not available in the market yet. We will develop a user-friendly system with web and desktop applications. We will also develop algorithms and dynamic graphical methods for the analysis of dropout data and the diagnosis of modeling assumptions. The software will be useful to biomedical researchers working on sociological, behavioral and biomedical studies with complex data structures.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Generations of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) have spent their childhoods fighting for breath and losing. Until recently, CF patients succumbed to this fatal, inherited lung disease as infants, young children or adolescents. With cutting-edge research spurring medical advances, each decade has shown improved survival, from a median life expectancy of 5 years in 1960, to 16 years in 1970, to 35 years today. Yet, the disease remains complex and adolescents with CF experience challenges that can reduce their adherence to treatment regimens and undermine their long-term well-being. Poor adherence to complicated life long treatments impacts a patient's health and burdens the medical system. Adolescents are particularly vulnerable to poor adherence and its high costs. Even adolescents who experience comparatively mild symptoms of CF must follow a 3-hour treatment regimen every day, and medical experts report that their adherence ranges from poor (50% doing less than prescribed airway clearance regimen) to very poor (30% not doing any prescribed treatments). CF can cause a host of social-emotional stressors, including uncertainty about the future, poor self-image, low self-esteem, and frustration with delayed growth/maturation all of which can impede adherence. Absences from school, being teased, keeping their illness secret, and lack of access to peers with CF due to risk of infection leave many adolescents with CF feeling isolated and alone. Due to parent over-protection and medical services that focus on symptoms, these patients often lack supportive coaching on issues (e.g., alcohol-and tobacco-related risks, sexual health, infection control, pain control, career prospects) that can impact the quality of their life. This Phase I application proposes to test the feasibility of producing an innovative learning and support program that will provide 11 year-old to15 year-old adolescents with CF with health information and social support opportunities. The program, called CFFONE: A Cell Phone Support Program for Adolescents with Cystic Fibrosis, will make use of cutting-edge technology-a broadband capable, cellular telephone keyed into a highly interactive informational web site. This web site will provide engaging, adolescent-tailored online learning activities and resources specific to adolescents with CF. We believe the information and activities contained in CFFONE will improve users' knowledge, attitudes, and practices around CF and we hypothesize that adolescents exposed to the intervention will demonstrate an increase in adherence to their treatment regimens. A recent National Institutes for Health solicitation for research to improve self-management and quality of life in children and adolescents with chronic diseases stated that,  Children with a chronic disease face a lifetime of careful health management requirements and lifestyle adaptations to prevent or manage related health complications. Interventions that make a difference in childhood disease self-management may set the stage for health outcomes later in life.  (2003) We believe that CFFONE, with its innovative approach for enhancing self-management, has the potential to make that kind of difference in the lives of adolescents with cystic fibrosis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Adolescents with cystic fibrosis are particularly vulnerable to poor adherence, which negatively impacts their health status, quality of life and long term survival. CFFONE: A Cell Phone Support Program for Adolescents with Cystic Fibrosis will make use of cutting-edge technology- a broadband capable, cellular telephone keyed into a highly-interactive informational web site.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this program is to develop a therapeutic which can prevent acute inflammation from destroying living tissue in proximity to a severe burn injury. This drug would reduce the severity of burn injuries by reducing the need for skin grafting and other surgical procedures and decreasing the time required for the wound to heal. This project is based on the finding that natural antibodies play a key role in the initiation of the inflammatory response at the site of tissue injury. Initial studies demonstrated that the acute inflammatory response could be blocked by certain peptides which prevented the binding of natural antibodies to specific antigens at the site of injury. The Phase I project goal was to determine if this mechanism could be applied to burn injury and if these peptides were effective in controlling inflammation following burn injury in mice. The Phase I project was highly successful. All of the aims were achieved and additional data were obtained in both mouse and rat models to support the probability of success of this model in the treatment of acute burn injury. The Phase II project is focused on generating the pre-clinical data that will support the movement of this drug candidate into human trials. Specifically the aims are targeted at 1) determining the optimal formulation, dose, route and timing of delivery of therapy for the treatment of clinical burns, 2) determining the distribution, degradation and toxicity of the selected drug candidate, and 3) determining the effectiveness of the proposed drug in a pig model of burn injury. Pigs are accepted as an animal model with skin structure similar to humans and will add to the data supporting the cross species effectiveness obtained in mice and rats. This approach, if successful, would be a breakthrough in the treatment of severe burns. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Over 75,000 patients per year are hospitalized for severe burn injuries, spending an average of two weeks undergoing painful and expensive treatments for their injuries, including antibiotics, nutritional and surgical care of the wound. Much of the final extent of tissue loss following burn injury is not from the burn itself, but from the acute inflammatory reaction which occurs at the site of the injury and the surrounding tissue. The goal of this project is to develop therapeutic agents which reduce the acute inflammatory destruction of living tissue surrounding a burn wound and result in a wound which heals faster and with less need for skin grafting or other surgical intervention, reduced hospitalization costs and less permanent scarring and debilitating effects to the patient.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Responsible beverage service (RBS) training originated some quarter century ago to prevent driving under the influence among patrons of public drinking establishments, from which half of DUI arrests and alcohol-related crashes originate. These programs train licensed servers of alcohol regarding medical and legal risks of providing and consuming alcohol. This population is accessible through alcoholic beverage regulatory agency databases. However, the other half of DUI incidents originate in less easily accessed private drinking environments, where knowledge of alcohol effects, risks, and legal implications are less well known. Social hosts can also be held liable for actions of their intoxicated guests and need the same knowledge base provided by RBS training programs to public servers. One of the few accessible social host populations at elevated risk for alcohol problems and legal liability is the membership of college fraternities and sororities. In Phase I we developed a prototype training program addressing public health and liability reduction needs for Greek officers, social leaders and risk managers who face special challenges in protecting minors from alcohol and preventing alcohol abuse in their social groups. Based on a proximal social influence model, this web-training was evaluated by a sample of Greek social leaders at an Oregon University, with promising results. Greek organizations consistently show much higher rates of alcohol use and abuse than other student populations, but provide opportunities to reinforce preventive training content through social influence within stable young adult social systems. Our Web-based program will have several advantages: (1) wide availability independent of physical location of trainees; (2) a standardized curriculum for use by multiple sites within Greek and university systems; (3) continuously available components for refresher, problem- focused or incident-driven trainings; (4) a Web format familiar to young users; and (5) modifiability for a variety of campuses and campus settings. The project will first survey 140 subjects from national fraternities and sororities associated with the nationwide BACCHUS Network and use their suggestions, together with focus group data and recommendations from our scientific and training consultants to develop an expanded and finished web site. This will employ research-based methodologies, draw upon a RBS training web site we have developed for commercial alcohol servers, and include professionally produced video modeling of best practices in challenging social situations identified through our survey and focus group data. We will then test both the usability and effectiveness of the web site to increase knowledge, attitudes of concern, and confidence in applying systemic modifications and social hosting skills in a randomized controlled study of 300 Greek officers, social chairs and risk managers drawn from 60 BACCHUS-affiliated campuses with alcohol-oriented GAMMA chapters. These will be stratified by five geographic regions representing both urban and rural communities across the United States and will include immediate and 30-day post assessments. Follow-up semi-structured interviews will be conducted with a subsample of 30 respondents indicating utilization of the web training ideas or methods at 30 day post-test. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: College alcohol abuse is a serious national problem, and is most serious within fraternities and sororities where the rates of heavy drinking are 2-3 times those of other students. We are developing a web-based training for Greek chapter officers, risk managers, and social planners, designed to assist peer leaders to modify the social environments in which risky drinking occurs. The study will evaluate the web based training program in a study of 300 social hosts in fraternities and sororities on 15 college campuses.",

Obesity increases the risk of diabetes, heart attack, stroke, cancer, arthritis, sleep apnea and other diseases. Researchers are making progress to find and control the behavioral and biochemical factors that drive weight gain and their progress points to successful weight management strategies. To continue they will need better data on free living energy balance and the ability to create and deliver individualized prescriptions. This project will create a mobile phone system that assesses energy balance and test its usability with adolescents and young adults. Our purpose is to demonstrate the effectiveness of mobile phones to quantify a wide range of important factors in overweight and weight management. The phone is used to collect energy balance information (intake, activity and weight change) from a user throughout the day for an indefinite period. The user enters meals and snacks, activity descriptions, and other context input in response to questions or as free text. In the background the phone automatically collects tri-axial accelerometer readings and information about the user's movement via GPS. All the information is collected first in the mobile phone then transmitted to a central system in near to real time where it is stored and maintained for analysis.",

To exploit this resource, submersible pumps with extended service lives are required to improve the economics of today\u00bfs geothermal systems.  A major problem is corrosive wear experienced by the pump bearings, when the lubricating brine becomes contaminated with fine sand particles.  Typically, the bearings are hardfaced with WC/Co-Cr, which can resist degradation only when no sand is present.  Thus, the bearings fall far short of the desired 5-10 years lifetimes.  This project will develop diamond-hardfaced carbide-metal nanocomposites, in which a compositionally-graded layer of diamond nanoparticles is bonded to a nanostructured carbide-metal substrate.  The graded coating/substrate interface resists coating spallation over the long term, even when the original geothermal brine becomes contaminated with entrained sand particles.  Phase I fabricated a diamond-hardfaced WC/Co-Cr nanocomposite, in which a functionally-graded layer of diamond nanoparticles was bonded to a nanostructured WC/Co-Cr substrate.  In Phase II, extensive materials characterization and mechanical properties studies will be performed.Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The nanocomposite structure would exhibit mechanical properties advantages that include higher hardness and compressive strength, as well as improved fracture toughness.  Beyond the application to geothermal wells, other potential commercial applications for diamond-hardfaced nanocomposites include machine tools, drill bits, and wear parts.",

This project will develop an aqueous-phase base-facilitated reforming (BFR) and feedstock selection process that addresses these shortcomings.  In Phase I, hydrogen yield from BFR was experimentally determined for different feedstocks (paper, wood, grass, food) in batch reactors and found to be between 50 % and 90% of theoretical.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hypertension is a confounding multifactorial disorder that affects millions of patients worldwide. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited disease of the pulmonary and gastrointestinal systems that presents in pediatric and young adult populations. What do hypertension and cystic fibrosis (CF) have in common? The central common feature is enhanced absorptive sodium (Na+) transport. Heightened Na+ transport across renal epithelial cells in the latter segments of the nephron of the kidney drives hypertension; accelerated salt absorption across respiratory epithelial cells causes airway surface dehydration in CF. A cardinal rule in vascular physiology is that 2x plasma Na+ concentration equates with normal plasma osmolality and sets plasma volume and blood pressure, the physiological parameter that is elevated in hypertension. The balance of chloride secretion and Na+ absorption sets the depth of hydration of the ciliated layer on the airway epithelial cell surface. A recent mouse model of CF where an epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) is conditionally upregulated has proven to be the best mouse model mimicking CF lung disease. Knockouts of the CF gene itself have not been as successful. DiscoveryBioMed, Inc. (DBM) has developed a novel and electrical high-throughput molecular screening format where Na+ transport inhibitors (NTIs) will be discovered via assessment of Na+ transport across polarized epithelial cell models of the renal collecting duct and the CF airway.  Na+ transport proteins are the shared molecular target for both disease platforms. ENaC and other epithelial Na+-permeable channels and transporters are notoriously difficult to study outside of a polarized epithelial cell format. Because of this fact, DBM has developed this novel electrical HTS method to screen panels of molecular libraries on polarized epithelial cell models from the kidney (to find potential therapeutics to fight hypertension) and the airways (to find potential therapeutics to fight CF). DBM holds a core principle that drug discovery is accelerated if the screening is performed on an epithelial cell model of disease that maintains in vivo characteristics. DBM has found hit compounds through its novel electrical HTS bioassay that are inhibitors of Na+ transport in kidney collecting duct epithelia, CF airway epithelia or both. The central hypothesis of this Phase 1 (II) SBIR proposal is that novel NTIs will be found that will be developed into viable therapeutics for both hypertension as a large market disease and CF as a niche market disease. This Phase 1 (II) SBIR program has 2 milestones. Milestone 1 aims to select, perfect and optimize the use of polarized kidney collecting duct and airway epithelial cell models for electrical HTS for Na+ transport inhibitors. Milestone 2 is to complete a pilot screen of 15,000 compounds and to validate, compare and contrast the hit compounds found from the pilot electrical screen with additional Na+ transport-relevant assays. The over-arching goal of this work is to identify small molecules that may attenuate enhanced Na+ transport that fuels hypertension, CF or both human diseases, compounds that may eventually be transformed into new therapeutics for these diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hypertension is a debilitating and common disorder that often takes root in the kidney and the vascular system. Upregulation of the activity of proteins in cells that regulate plasma salt and blood pressure, often in the kidney, are routinely involved in renal hypertensive disorders, chronic kidney diseases with hypertension, and vascular diseases. Cystic fibrosis is a disease of children and young adults that causes mortality due to its progressive and debilitating lung disease. Accelerated absorption of salt dehydrates the airways and cause sticky mucus accumulation that eventually obstructs airflow leading to pulmonary decline. Our company seeks to find inhibitors of elevated salt transport that confound and accelerate the progression of multiple human diseases.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will use RNA interference (RNAi) to limit damage to corn from the plant parasite lesion nematode by silencing genes in the parasite. Phase I demonstrated in culture that expression of specific double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) from lesion genes limited nematode reproduction and increased root mass. In Phase II, validated constructs will be progressed to whole plant transformation. Transgenic plants with expression of the dsRNAs will be tested in greenhouse assays for control of lesion nematode. In parallel, the validated laboratory assays validated will be used to select next-generation constructs. Success in Phase II research will justify a field trial program.  The broader impact of this research is to increase corn yields by commercializing a biotechnology trait for control of lesion nematode. Agriculture is under tremendous pressure to achieve improved yields and ensure the availability of crops. A major limitation on crop are parasites that damage root systems causing annual yield losses valued at $8 billion in the U.S. Currently available nematicides are toxic. In corn, there are no genetic sources of nematode resistance. Using RNAi, we aim to create biotechnology traits that provide season-long resistance to lesion nematode.

This project will design the complete ICRF transmitter and will work with researchers from Alcator-C Mod to identify, build, and install subsystem upgrades into the existing FMIT RF transmitter.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A greatly expanded thermodynamic database for modified oligonucleotides will be developed in this project and incorporated into existing design software. This Fast Track SBIR proposal focuses on determining thermodynamic parameters for modifications that are currently finding widespread applications. The new thermodynamic database and software will enable a large number of researchers throughout the world to more easily develop advanced applications with modified oligonucleotides and will add substantial commercial value to the software products. In this new proposal, the range of modified oligonucleotides will be greatly increased to include a variety of non-nucleotide linkers and 13 additional modified nucleotides that have found the widest applications. These modifications include modified nucleotides that improve thermodynamic stability (2,6- diaminopurine, 2'-O-methyl RNA, 5-propynylpyrimidines), universal bases (5-nitroindole and 3-nitropyrole), modified oligonucleotides used in therapeutics (phosphorothioates, 2'-O-methyl RNA, 2'-fluoropyrimidines) and modified oligonucleotides with other applications (2-aminopurine, 2-thiothymine, 5-methylcytosine, 7- deazaguanine). This work complements the work done on other modified nucleotides whose thermodynamic parameters were measured during a previous project (under R44GM076745). The study involves a systematic series of measurements on over 500 modified duplexes along with unmodified controls. The newly determined parameters will be incorporated into a software database to enable simulation and in silico optimization of hybridization experiments in the presence of a wider coverage of modified oligonucleotides than previously possible. This will aid researchers in designing more robust assays and therapeutics. Modified oligonucleotides can be categorized either by the structure of the modified nucleotide or by its intended application. In this proposed research, a representative sample of the most commonly used modifications, both by structure and by function, is examined. Although many modifications are used in combination with one another, it is not proposed to study combinations of different modifications within the same oligonucleotide in this project as the number of possible combinations would make this task untenable. Some examples of modifications used in combination include: 2'-O-methyl-RNA containing terminal phosphorothioate, LNA-2'-O-methyl-RNA combinations, and phosphorothioate-LNA combinations. In addition to the measurements of thermodynamic parameters for oligonucleotides not previously measured, it will be necessary to restructure the software modeling and simulation program to allow for the inclusion of these nucleotides in both calculation and display modules of the program.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research proposal has the goal of measuring the rate of reaction of DNA strands with DNA or RNA to form a duplex structure, building a mathematical model for determining the rate constant of that reaction, and incorporating that model into existing software for design and simulation of oligonucleotide reactions. In phase I the rate of reaction will be measured at a single buffer condition for a series of DNA/DNA reactions with oligos designed not to have secondary structure. These oligos will vary by length, sequence, and G/C content and will have their reaction rates determined over a range of temperatures from about 15 ?C to the melting temperature. Based on preliminary studies, the dissociation rates for similar reactions have been shown to follow the Arrhenius rate equation. Mathematical models will be constructed for the rate behavior of these simple model reactions. The models will be tested and validated and the testing results will be used to improve the models. The mathematical models will then be incorporated into a spreadsheet based rate calculator that incorporates a differential equation solver and will compute reaction rates and concentrations as a function of time for oligos with no secondary structure and at the buffer conditions of phase I. In phase II the constraints from phase I on duplex hybridization reactions will be removed. In particular, the restriction of no competing secondary structures will be lifted and reaction rates will be determined for oligos pairs with secondary structure intentionally built in. Oligo pairs similar to those in phase I will be modified so that one of the strands has a controlled secondary structure, which will be modified in a systematic way. An analysis of the reaction rates of these new hairpin structures and comparison with the similar duplexes without hairpins will facilitate the elaboration of the mathematical model to include secondary structure. In addition to hairpins with small 3 base loops, molecular beacons will be used to model the effect of secondary structure in oligos with larger loops. The effect of coaxial stacking on rates will be considered for cases where two shorter oligos bind to a longer target with or without a short gap between them. In addition, phase II will also examine DNA/RNA systems, similar to the phase I DNA/DNA studies. Buffer composition has a significant impact on the reaction rate as shown in preliminary studies. A systematic study of the effect of buffer concentration on DNA/DNA reactions and DNA/RNA reaction will be carried out for sodium ion concentrations in the range of 0.1 to 1.01 M and magnesium ion concentrations in the range of 0 to 6 mM. The rate data from both phases will then be accumulated into a mathematical model which will predict the rate of reaction and oligo concentrations of all species in the reaction and will allow for all variable used in the study. This mathematical model will be incorporated as a module in our oligonucleotide modeling platform (OMP) software package. The software will then be capable predict all possible structures (e.g. monomers, self-dimers, heterodimers) in a reaction and their concentration over time, based on both kinetics and thermodynamics principles.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The exponential growth of sequence databases in the genomics era was promoted by the desire to understand fundamental macromolecular structural mechanisms, and how these structures interact with oligonucleotides, proteins and metabolites in a cell. However, a huge discrepancy in the number of corresponding 3D structures available exists. Current experimental methods of 3D structure determination, such as X-ray crystallography and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, can be cumbersome and problematic, requiring a huge time investment as well as a team of experts that are trained in these techniques. To address these concerns software tools were developed to model macromolecular complexes, but they are rudimentary in that they are still very computationally expensive, they cannot model very large macromolecular structures such as the ribosome, they are not unified into a single platform, and they have not been critically evaluated to date. In this Fast Track SBIR application DNA Software, Inc. proposes to extend the functionality of an existing 3D homology structure prediction platform. Our current prototype software, RNA-123, has focused upon RNA and it can already accurately predict the 3D structures of molecules the size of 5S rRNA (~120 nucleotides long) using sequence-based homology modeling. The engineering and extension of the functionality of this software will enable a researcher, for the very first time, to study the structural mechanisms of a whole ribosome. RNA-123 will make it possible to model pathogenic bacterial ribosomes, where no crystal structures currently exist, to exploit them in a timely manner to develop new classes of rationally designed RNA-targeted drugs. This objective will be accomplished in seven specific aims (aims 1-3 in Phase I and aims 1-4 in Phase II): Aim 1.1: Engineer existing 3D prediction technology, RNA-123, and extend its capabilities to allow for the prediction of 3D structures of larger sequences and complexes. Aim 1.2: Predict the 3D structure of 16S rRNA of T. Thermophilus by using the known 3D crystal structure of 16S rRNA of E. coli as a template and vice versa. Aim 1.3: Test the software developed in aim 1.1 by assessing the 16S rRNA structures predicted in aim 1.2. Aim 2.1: To extend the capabilities of the software developed in phase 1 to allow homology modeling of protein-RNA complexes the size of a bacterial or eukaryotic ribosome. Aim 2.2: Predict and evaluate structures for the known complete ribosomes (70S) and ribosomal subunits (30S and 50S) to test the software developed in aims 1 of phase I and II. Aim 2.3: Correlation of predicted 3D structures of E. coli's 16S rRNA mutants with their biological activity. Aim 2.4: Predict 3D structure of the complete ribosomes of P.aeruginosa, and S. aureus, 2 clinically important pathogens. This grant will have long-term effects on the scientific community as a whole, because once the functionality of RNA-123 is extended to be able to homology model an entire ribosome, it can be easily adapted to model biopolymers, DNA, and carbohydrates as well as their complexes with each other, RNA, and drug-like small molecules. RNA-123 will enable scientists with the latest, most accurate bioinformatics tool available, having an immediate impact on all of humanity.",

        "abstract": "This Small Innovation Research (SBIR) project will bring to market a low power, point of use (PoU) water disinfection system designed to retrofit into existing passive (non-germicidal) filtration systems. This project will use ultraviolet light emitting diodes (UV LEDs) along with a novel and proprietary flow cell design, resulting in PoU water disinfection. Current ultraviolet PoU water disinfection is accomplished using discharge lamps, which requires high voltage, ballasts, and a relatively large form factor. The use of UV LEDs instead of discharge lamps will allow the light sources to reside inside a smaller form factor, and to function at lower overall electrical power, without line voltage and ballasts. Furthermore, the proprietary optical design of the flow cell will improve upon conventional flow cells by maximizing the ultraviolet dose received by microorganisms in the water, and increasing their residence time in the flow cell.  Currently, there are no PoU systems employing UV LEDs as the germicidal source. If successful, the product developed under the phase II program will be the first of its kind and provide a point of entry for UV LEDs into the large PoU water sterilization market. The low power aspect and small form factor of the flow cell will make the system potentially suitable for battery operated field applications where line voltage is not available. Such applications may include military or medical field operations. Overall societal impact should be significant, particularly in markets outside the United States where there is increasing concern about water sterility.",

        "abstract": "The International Linear Collider (ILC) will need hundreds of modulators to power the 10-MW, long pulse (1.4 ms) klystrons.  A Marx modulator controlled by solid-state switches promises higher efficiency, longer lifetime, and reduced cost compared to existing hard tube modulator options.  However, voltage droop is one of the critical challenges that limit the application of the Marx modulators.  The current approach to minimizing this problem, using vernier cells, is unable to smooth the flat top of the voltage pulse output, requiring an additional high voltage charging source and a large number of cells, which complicate the design of the Marx circuit.  This project will develop a new compensation scheme that exploits the high speed of solid-state switches and the circuit characteristics of additional inductance.  Phase I demonstrated that simple compensation circuitry based on this scheme can be implemented on an existing Marx main cell structure.  Simulations of the modified vernier cell showed compensation to within 1%. In Phase II, an 11 kV modified vernier cell will be designed and built.  After initial high voltage laboratory testing, the modified cell will be integrated into SLAC\u00bfs Marx modulator for a real-time application test. Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The new compensation circuits should benefit the ILC project directly by meeting its stringent requirements for hundreds of modulators.  It also would complement SLAC\u00bfs Marx modulator program and other accelerator facilities that require long pulse modulators.  Examples of such facilities include the TTF at DESY (hundreds of modulators, pulse width of 1.6 e ms) and the KEK in Japan (pulse width of 600 s)",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Target drug and gene delivery are rapidly emerging applications for ultrasound contrast agents since they reduce potential deleterious side effects to healthy tissue and minimize the overall dose needed. Development of new contrast agents requires a good understanding of the effect of the properties of the viscous material of the shell and of the acoustic field on the dynamics of the agent and on the mechanism of breakup of the shell. A novel numerical code, which enables modeling of non-spherical contrast agent's dynamics acoustic waves and nearby boundaries and tissues is proposed. This model, whose feasibility was demonstrated in Phase I, will allow us to accurately predict the necessary conditions for breakup. In Phase I we coupled a Boundary Element Method solver and a Navier-Stokes solver and demonstrated 3D modeling of viscous thick shelled contrast agent including in the presence of rigid walls, and identified the mechanisms for shell breakup due to non-spherical deformations. In the Phase II study, we will complete, improve and expand the capabilities of the model to simulate viscoelastic shell material properties and simulate multiple contrast agents' interactions with deformable boundaries such as blood cells, tissues, and blood vessels. We will also validate the developed model experimentally using both a scaled-up test for visualization and actual contrast agents for breakup limit confirmation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Success of this research will help pharmaceutical companies develop safer and more efficient drug and gene delivery agents. These agents are especially attractive to chemotherapy treatment because they can greatly reduce deleterious side effects to healthy tissue caused by many chemotherapy drugs and minimize the overall dose needed.",

        "abstract": "The development of very small, versatile, rugged, low power, low noise, one or three-axis short-period seismometers is needed to monitor nuclear detonations.  Specifications include total sensor size less than 1 cubic inch, low power consumption, low sensor self noise below the USGS Low Earth Noise Model, and dynamic range of at least 120 dB over a frequency band of 0.2 to 40 Hz.  However, all commercially available high performance seismometers are large, heavy, and consume high power.  Users therefore must choose between using instruments with significantly lower performance characteristics or reducing the size of the network.  This situation is untenable, given the DOE responsibility to deploy detection systems for nuclear treaty monitoring and the current tight budget climate.  This project will develop a new type of seismometer based on liquid inertial masses and electrochemical transducers.  The approach involves the further miniaturization of a medium-period seismometer while maintaining low self noise and low power consumption.  In Phase I, the concept was proven by building a working prototype, which was the size of a quarter.  Phase II will improve sensor specifications and reduce the size. Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The new seismometer should provide invaluable information on near-field and remote earthquakes, dynamic processes in the mantle, offshore oil exploration, and the behavior of structures subjected to seismic activity.

        "abstract": "Clean drinking water is a critical component of the United States infrastructure and is therefore a potential target for terrorists.  In addition to physical attacks to the water network, like dams, pumping stations and pipelines, there must be vigilance to prevent the water itself from being fouled with toxic/hazardous chemicals.  It is virtually impossible to protect every river, stream or lake that contributes to the nations drinking water supply; therefore rapid detection of a chemical/biological attack followed by rapid remediation is paramount.  Many toxins are deadly at very low dosages (low ppb or less for chemical, 1-100 cts/mL for biologic), requiring sensitive and precise measurements.  Immediate on-site identification and action precludes the transport of samples to a laboratory setting.  This program will demonstrate a handheld sensor that could also be potentially used in-line.  This sensor is based on Surface-enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS); the ability of SERS to detect chemical warfare agents was demonstrated at EIC Laboratories during the Joint Services Agent Water Monitoring program.  In the Phase I program, SERS detection of a wide variety of chemical warfare agent simulants and degradation products as well as several pesticides and other TICs was demonstrated.  Unique identification of each analyte was shown and ROC curve analyses were performed on some agent simulants.  The ROC curves demonstrate that SERS can detect the analytes of interest with a high degree of sensitivity and selectivity.  The highly encouraging Phase I experiments performed showed very few false positives and very few false negatives.  The Phase II program will engineer and fabricate a compact, full range high resolution totally automatable SERS spectrograph with sampling accessory for rapid (~60s) field identification and quantification of aqueous toxins.  The throughput and stray light rejection abilities of the instrument will be defined as will the precision of the SERS sensors.  An expanded library of TICs will be collects and ROC curves generated.  The program will culminate with testing against a chemical warfare agent during the ETV option.  The Phase I results are extremely encouraging and point to the possibility for a fieldable instrument that can rapidly identify and quantify chemical warfare agent or toxic industrial chemicals that have entered the water supply.  Although developed for Homeland Security measures, this sensor can also be used to monitor cleanups of toxic spills or pesticide/fertilizer runoff from nearby farms.  The sensor could also be extended to biological contaminations.",

This new tool combines the much-used electromechanical transient stability function with a detailed protection system simulation.  It will enable the study of different contingencies and scenarios, some of which may lead to cascading outages.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project proposes the development of an innovative and facile method to synthesize composite magnet powders coated with Fe and/or Fe-Co nanoparticles and to consolidate them into high performance anisotropic nanocomposite magnets. It was theoretically predicted in the 1990s that two phase exchange-coupled nanocomposite magnets consisting of a hard magnetic phase with high magnetocrystalline anisotropy and a soft magnetic phase with high saturation magnetization may exhibit a maximum energy product (BH)max twice the value of the current magnets. In this research effort, Fe and Fe-Co nanoparticles will be deposited onto hard magnetic powders by combined chemical and physical methods. Unlike previously employed techniques, the proposed approach allows the control of the size of soft magnetic phase to the nanoscale. Moreover, the approach is compatible with mass production. Subsequent consolidation of these composite powders by pressure and temperature assisted methods will lead to a new generation of high performance anisotropic nanocomposite permanent magnets with a (BH)max much higher than that of the current commercial magnets. The multiple choices for the core powder will result in new improved magnets for close-to-room-temperature applications (Nd2Fe14B-based), high temperature applications (SmCo5- and Sm2Fe17Nx-based) and ultra-high temperature applications (Sm2Co17-based).  The success in the development of the new (nano)composite magnets will directly result in the improvement of the functionality of electromagnetic devices and eventually lead to new applications not possible with the current permanent magnets.\nThe higher performance magnets will result in even lighter weight, smaller footprint and lower the total system cost for electromagnetic devices in both commercial and military applications. The most well known applications are in: hybrid cars (permanent magnet motors and generators,  sensors  and actuators), spacecraft (momentum wheels, reaction wheels, stepper motors, ion propulsion), microwave sources (traveling wave tube amplifiers, klystrons, magnetrons), microwave components (isolators, circulators), inertial guidance (accelerometers, gyros), and other commercial systems (computer disk drives, computer printers, audio systems, satellite communication, medical imaging,  stepper motors, etc). The proposal is a multidisciplinary enterprise involving physics, chemistry, and metallurgy. The bottom-up approach to the synthesis of nanocomposite magnets with uniform and controllable thickness of the soft magnetic shell formed from the precursor nanoparticle coating, will allow for an in-detail experimental characterization of magnetic interactions. This will provide valuable information to understand and substantially diminish the gap between the theoretical predictions and engineering capabilities.",

ISAC is an online analysis processing (OLAP) system with focused utility for supporting decisions concerning policy and programs that will mitigate the consequences of substance abuse. To achieve this purpose, we will implement the following steps: We will a) significantly improve the IT platform that supported our ISAC test module in Phase I, and seek ways to strengthen content through addition of important indicators; b) develop, test and incorporate guidance materials in the tool portal, guidance tools in displays, and auxiliary (e.g., linked on-line training materials) locations to assist users in effectively using information for decision purposes; c) conduct a careful, multi-method study that monitors the use of ISAC in twelve California counties selected for their diversity in dimensions of need and capacity for implementing data- based decision making concerning substance abuse prevention; d) assess the current status of relevant data systems nationwide to identify opportunities and challenges in adapting ISAC across states; e) revise our California ISAC product and our generic platform and ISAC system as necessary; and f) finalize our California and nationwide marketing strategy. The RandD activities proposed for Phase II build on the findings and lessons generated by our Phase I activities. The Phase I R and D supported a conclusion that the proposed ISAC system a) is perceived by intended consumers to meet a variety of real needs for decision-relevant information in planning, policy and resource allocation, accountability, and evaluation of substance abuse prevention and associated areas; b) is perceived as very usable by intended consumers; c) is technologically feasible, but requires significant development to produce a finished product that meets all the analytic, display and interpretation support needs identified in Phase I feasibility testing; d) would meet the locally specific information needs required by current federal policy; and d) is cost-effective compared to the cost of achieving a comparable information base through local resources.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There is currently a strong policy focus on utilizing alcohol and other drug (AOD) indicator data in developing comprehensive prevention plans. Federal funding to states for prevention planning 1) require the use of the Strategic Planning Framework (SPF), which is a data driven planning model, and 2) the use of AOD National Outcome Measures (NOMs) for determining community and state effectiveness in dealing with alcohol and drug problems. This project proposes the development of a web-based prototype that makes use of archival data sets on ADO incident data to facilitate local (county) level planning and assessment efforts. This project can bring important benefits by effectively providing a single source compilation of AOD data in a manipulate-able format for local planners.",

First, development of advanced finite element analysis (FEA) methods specifically focused on shape memory polymers will provide a time- and cost-effective means of evaluating medical device designs. Second, large-deformation FEA models have not been thoroughly developed for shape memory polymers; further, user materials routines specifically for shape memory polymers are not available currently and would provide ease-of-use advantages in implementing and optimizing device design.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II research project will create an information-based robotic grasping framework to enable practical grasping of objects for any robotic manipulator and any robotic hand, or even multiple hands. Grasp algorithms are stored in an XML database organized in a tree structure that allows rapid access and uses intelligent caching for very large databases. When a new object is presented to the grasping system, best matches are found in the database and the corresponding algorithms are extrapolated to determine the best grasp for the new object. Shape, surface properties, and articulation are used for matching. The techniques support the grasping of moving objects that can be tracked with a vision-based system. For constructing the grasp database, human supervisors train new grasps by simply picking up objects and giving special cues. Collection devices, such as data gloves and machine vision systems, are used to collect the supervisor?s hand position and contact forces, and a learning module finds new grasps by coupling supervisory input with simulation-based optimization, using high-fidelity dynamic modeling. For optimization, control and configuration parameters (in end-effector space) are perturbed iteratively using nonlinear numerical optimization techniques.  If successful the creation of a comprehensive grasping framework as proposed in this project will have broad impact to research, industry, and society. Traditional grasping systems require\nspecialized coding for new tasks and new robots. The proposed system will facilitate specific instantiations of general grasping algorithms. Application to virtually any robot manipulator, any hand, and any object to be grasped will be possible. This unprecedented flexibility, coupled with advanced and innovative grasping algorithms will play a role in advancing general purpose robots (those that can do multiple tasks without reprogramming). Robots with the ability to grasp hold promise for industries with labor shortages. The agricultural industry, for instance, will use robotic grasping for harvesting. Grasping robots will work in dangerous environments. An example application is rescuing injured humans in dangerous situations. Next-generation robots will assist the disabled with intelligent manipulators that can open doors and pick up objects. Grasping robots will support manufacturing and warehouse businesses.

        "abstract": "Increasingly, strict environmental regulations, surging energy demand and oil prices, and the proliferation of the internet and electronic devices have given rise to a growing market demand for efficient, clean, and renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind energy.  However, the electricity generated from these renewable sources suffers from the drawback of fluctuation.  To solve this problem, a low cost, reliable, long life, and efficient electrical energy storage (EES) system is sought to ensure 24/\u00ad7 reliability for commercial and residential grid applications.  One option is to use alkaline-based rechargeable batteries, such as Ni\u00adMH, provided that issues of performance, safety, and cost effectiveness can be addressed.  This project will investigate replacing the aqueous KOH electrolyte with a solid polymer electrolyte.  Phase I developed a novel hydroxyl conductive membrane with the following characteristics:  (1) high ionic conductivity; (2) good thermal, chemical, and electrochemical stability; (3) scalable for large quantity manufacturing; (4) good compatibility with other cell components; and (5) low cost.  Bipolar cell stacks were fabricated with this membrane, and excellent electrochemical performance was obtained.  In Phase II, the hydroxyl conductive membrane will be incorporated into a unique bipolar Ni\u00adMH battery.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The membrane not only should find use as the energy storage system for load leveling of electricity generated from renewable sources, but also could be used in Ni\u00adMH batteries that already have been commercialized in hybrid electric vehicles (HEV).  In the future, it also could be used as the energy storage device in plug-\u00adin HEVs",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II research project is aimed at developing devices for the detection of terahertz (THz) signals and a spectrometer based on these devices. To date, the lack of suitable electronic devices have made the THz region of the electromagnetic spectrum inaccessible except by use of large and costly scientific instruments. The aim is to develop a simple, low-cost, low-power receiver which will make this important region accessible. The three critical components of the THz heterodyne receiver are an antenna, microbolometer/mixer and quantum cascade laser which functions as a local oscillator. With these novel components it is possible to develop a portable, field-deployable THz spectrometer capable of monitoring a wide variety of gases in its vicinity. The high-sensitivity spectrometer will allow rapid identification of chemicals and remote sensing of gases for environmental, global warming, and homeland security applications.  The broader impacts of this research are that the THz receiver, which has high sensitivity and high spectral resolution not achievable with existing devices, can be used in a much wider variety of imaging and screening devices. THz screening of personnel is non-invasive and harmless. Explosives and biological agents can be detected and identified even if concealed in clothing and suitcases because the THz radiation is transmitted through clothing and luggage.  The proposed receiver also has a potential of providing THz imaging of biological materials and broad-band transmitting of digital signals.",

In Phase I, a cylindrical diamond-based DLA structure was designed.  Using a plasma CVD process, very high quality diamond tubes (5.5 mm diameter, thickness ~ 0.5 mm, and 2.5 cm long) were fabricated.  Surface quality was established using electron microscopy, and the electronic parameters of the diamond were measured using micro Raman and micro-photoluminescence  spectroscopy.

The Evisive Scan microwave interference scanning method has been successfully demonstrated in Phase I of the project, where it was demonstrated successfully on Control Specimens and ceramic armor Surrogates designed and fabricated by ARL, and on samples of armor from Stryker and ASV programs. The patented scanning process utilizes microwaves as an interrogating beam to penetrate a dielectric material.  The interference pattern of the reflected microwave signal is displayed as an Evisive Scan image and indicates the presence of a potential defect, internal structure of interest, or change in material dielectric properties. In Phase II, Evisive will mature the technique demonstrated in Phase I into a field portable system, fabricate two prototype systems and follow field use of the prototype systems at the depot level.  The finalized NDE System design will be provided for commercial production and utilization by the US Army in Phase III of this project, where the program will be self funding. It is intended that the portable nondestructive health monitoring tool will be deployed with current forces and included as a tool for future weapons programs.

A major cause of vision loss in DR is increased retinal vascular permeability (RVP), leading to a build-up of fluid in the macula, a debilitating clinical condition known as diabetic macular edema (DME). We show by multiple lines of evidence that the serine protease plasma kallikrein (PK) is involved in the increased RVP in animal models of diabetes and hypertension. When delivered subcutaneously, PK inhibitors developed as part of our phase 1 grant effectively inhibit RVP in animal models of hypertension. PK inhibitors with oral bioavailability, however, would be preferred for chronic and long term administration to diabetics. The goal of this phase II grant is to develop a safe, effective and orally-available PK inhibitor for the chronic, long term treatment of DME in DR. We will specifically focus on our current series of PK inhibitors that have promise for oral bioavailability and are amenable to chemical changes that are proven to increase oral bioavailability. The inhibitors will be tested for their ability to block RVP in hypertensive and diabetic animals when given orally at moderate daily doses. The safety and potential  off-target  effects of the efficacious compounds will subsequently be determined so as to identify an orally-available compound with a sufficient safety margin that can be considered for further preclinical development and IND-enabling toxicology studies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This Phase II project proposes that inhibition of the serine protease plasma kallikrein (PK), would have significant therapeutic impact in reducing diabetic macular edema (DME) in diabetic retinopathy (DR). It seeks to optimize a lead series of small molecule inhibitors of PK to obtain orally available lead molecules for testing in animal models of diabetes- and hypertension-induced retinal vascular permeability, followed by initial evaluation of the potential safety margin for the lead molecule in a repeat-dose acute toxicology study.",

With its sensitivity, speed and portability, IMS has already been used in trace chemical detection that includes cleaning validation applications in pharmaceutical manufacturing processes. However, current commerc\nially available IMS systems have significant limitations in quantitative measurements and in the ability to analyze semi-volatile and non-volatile samples. In this project, an IMS is proposed to be interfaced to a novel electrospray ionization source for o\nn-site analysis of both small molecule and biological pharmaceuticals. The new system will accept samples either directly from a swab or extracted sample solution. As these samples are introduced into the IMS, the targeted analytes are ionized, separated, \nand quantitatively detected within seconds. More importantly, the new IMS system allows detection of low charge affinity compounds and provides quantitative information of targeted active ingredients and other substance of interests. This on-site analytica\nl technology can significantly reduce manufacturing down time and associated costs in the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed electrospray ionization ion mobility spectrometry (ESI-IMS) based cleaning validat\nion technology is consistent with NIH's Process Analytical Technology (PAT) initiative, the goal of which is to improve efficiency in pharmaceutical manufacturing and quality assurance.

The system consists of a miniature, battery powered gas chromatograph (the device) capable of measuring volatile metabolites (e.g., butanone) on an individual's breath after ingestion of a medication containing taggants (e.g., 2-butanol). This data can be sent to and evaluated by health care personnel via HIPAA-compliant information technology to allow opportunity to improve medication adherence. In Phase II activities, we propose a plan to optimize the design of the adherence system. The proposal consists of 7 aims. Specific Aim 1: Chemistry - characterize  generally recognized as safe  taggants for definitive adherence in humans. a) Determine breath pharmacokinetic parameters of two definitive taggants and their key volatile metabolites in fasting humans (months 1-6), and b) create a chemistry backup program to develop new definitive taggants (months 1-24). [Specific Aim 2: Food Interference - further validate that food does not interfere with this adherence system (months 6-12)]. Note: new aims are bracketed and in Georgia font. Specific Aim 3: Pharmacy - optimize the means whereby taggants are interfaced to pharmaceutical products for definitive adherence (months 1-24). Specific Aim 4: Portable Gas Sensor - finalize design of the mGC-MOS, a) optimize mGC and MOS components of mGC-MOS unit, b) design, implement and optimize a breath collection device, and c) identify a contract manufacturer (months 1-12). [Specific Aim 5: Information Technology and Data Processing - develop methods and techniques to locally store, transmit, remotely archive, and distribute adherence data in a HIPAA-compliant manner. Develop signal processing algorithms to improve taggant detection accuracy of device. (months 1-12) Specific Aim 6: Adherence System Accuracy - Conduct a pilot study in humans to test system performance (months 12-18). Specific Aim 7: Behavioral (Usability) Adherence System Evaluation - Conduct a pilot study in high risk, HIV/AIDS patients to test acceptance of the system (months 18-24).] The ability to stratify medication adherence rates to safety and efficacy parameters and linking adverse events to medication ingestion will lead to optimal decisions regarding clinical trial drugs safety and efficacy. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Nonadherence to prescribed medication regimens is a major health issue in the US which costs our healthcare system over  100 billion annually. Nonadherence is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. It can result in a public health threat if, for instance, a patient fails to adhere to an antibiotic or antiviral medication. This can lead to the emergence of resistant organisms. We propose to develop a small portable device that a patient can blow into shortly after taking their medication which will detect and document that the appropriate medication was taken at the proper time. This technology should improve adherence rates, especially in high-risk populations, and provide pharmaceutical companies and the FDA with an improved data set for evaluating drugs in clinical trials.",

Complications caused by adhesions include small bowel obstruction, female infertility, chronic debilitating pain, and difficulty in future operations.

Luna Innovations is developing sutureless resorbable adhesive barrier films for the prevention of intra-abdominal post-operative adhesions. Immediate applications include prevention of adhesions after laparotomy and laparoscopy, but the material can be adapted easily to create a family of adhesives or sealants with properties that can be customized for various applications including hemostatic agents, wound dressings, glues and sealants. The novel material consists of surface-modified blends of two abundant and low-cost polymers. The material can be used as a carrier for controlled release of therapeutics. It should also have inherent hemostatic and bacteriostatic properties and the degradation products should stimulate correct deposition, assembly and orientation of collagen fibrils in extracellular matrix components. Physical and mechanical properties, such as strength and degradation rate can be controlled by altering the composition while adhesion to tissue depends, in part, on the surface modification. Cytocompatibility, biodegradability and adhesion to tissue were demonstrated in Phase I. Phase II development will be focused on optimization, comprehensive in vitro and ex vivo testing, and validation in vivo.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The morbidity of obesity is a direct result of excess triglyceride accumulation, predominantly in adipose tissue and liver. Particularly in the liver, steatosis contributes to insulin resistance and Type II diabetes, and non- alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which may progress to cirrhosis and liver failure. GPAT (glycerol-3- phosphate acyltransferase) is the initial committed step in acylglycerol synthesis and has garnered interest as a target for obesity and metabolic therapy. A number of GPAT isoform knockout mice have shown modest reduction in adipose tissue, and increased fatty acid oxidation, however, no pharmacological GPAT inhibitors have been reported. Under funding from Phase I and II SBIR grants for obesity research, FASgen has developed the first pharmacological GPAT inhibitors which are efficacious in diet-induced obese mice. FASgen has synthesized series of GPAT inhibitors encompassing multiple chemical scaffolds. We have completed a series of in vitro and in vivo preclinical studies demonstrating proof-of-principal for metabolic disease therapy. Our compounds: (a) inhibit GPAT activity in mitochondrial preparations, (b) preferentially inhibit triglyceride synthesis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, (c) reversibly reduce weight and food intake in chronic treatment of DIO mice without toxicity, (d) increase fatty acid oxidation in DIO mice as measure by indirect calorimetry, (e) eliminate steatosis, normalize blood glucose, and reduce serum triglyceride levels in DIO mice, (f) increase expression of anorexigenic hypothalamic neuropeptides, and (g) enhance the expression of genes that favor fatty acid oxidation in liver and adipose tissue. The overall goal of this SBIR Phase II competitive renewal is to advance pharmacological GPAT inhibition towards commercialization. In this proposal we plan to [1] develop oral formulation for GPAT inhibitors, [2] finalize in vitro safety testing, [3] complete PK, CTA, and efficacy testing with DEXA adiposity measurements to select a lead compound [4] perform a 5-day rat TK study, [5] undergo cardiac testing in conscious dogs, and [6] conclude a formal 28-day preclinical GLP rat toxicity study. With these efficacy and safety data, we will schedule a pre-pre IND meeting with the FDA within 2 years. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Obesity and its associated diseases occur in epidemic proportions in the U.S., and are increasing worldwide. GPAT is a key enzyme in the pathway that synthesizes storage fat called triglyceride. FASgen has developed the first pharmacological inhibitors of GPAT that are effective in reducing weight in diet-induced obese mice.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Following a major bioterrorism attack or infectious disease outbreak, millions of potential victims may require rapid testing to ensure delivery of life-saving therapeutic treatment to those who need it. Because today there is no diagnostic method capable of high-performance large-scale testing in a crisis situation, thousands could die needlessly due to inefficient targeting of precious medical resources. We are developing the MultiPathTM Surge Testing Platform, the first high-performance high-throughput system designed for on-site clinical surge testing. The MultiPath system is an ideal surge-testing platform, being rapid, high throughput, sensitive, quantitative, accurate, cost-effective, user-friendly, portable, and automated. It accommodates tests for a broad menu of biothreat or infectious disease agents including bacteria, fungi, viruses, and toxins. While as sensitive as high performance central laboratory tests, the MultiPath assays are as rapid and as easy-to-use as over-the-counter rapid tests and require no sample preparation. The proprietary MultiPath immunoassay technology achieves high sensitivity and quantification by using digital imaging to count target molecules tagged with fluorescent particles without using magnification. The MultiPath assay design eliminates wash steps, reducing engineering complexity and cost while increasing throughput. Under a Phase II SBIR we designed and integrated a fully functional prototype of the MultiPath Surge Testing Platform and a sensitive surge test for anthrax. Our data demonstrate that the MultiPath Anthrax test rapidly (6 min) and sensitively (low pg/ml) detects two anthrax markers with high accuracy (internal positive and negative control assays are included for each marker) and specificity in small whole blood fingerstick samples with no sample prep. The prototype MultiPath platform automatically performs 600 assays/hour and integrates automated liquid handling, sample tracking, data analysis, and report generation. We propose to develop the commercial MultiPath Surge Testing Platform and MultiPath Anthrax Test. Specifically, we propose to (1) develop commercial quality particle-based immunoreagents for the ultra-sensitive MultiPath Anthrax test, (2) develop manufacturing procedures for large scale production of reagents that can be stored long-term at room temperature, (3) develop the commercial MultiPath Surge Testing Platform, (4) integrate the MultiPath Surge Testing Platform and MultiPath Anthrax test, and (5) verify the efficacy of the platform and anthrax test. To supplement our core expertise in developing MultiPath platform and assays, we will leverage the expertise of academic, industry, and government collaborators. On completion of the proposed project we will begin validation of the platform and anthrax test for subsequent regulatory submission. We propose to deploy the surge-testing platform and reagents to test for a menu of biothreat and disease outbreak agents at key points in the public health system - including the Strategic National Stockpile, state and city public health institutions, and the Laboratory Response Network. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Following a major bioterrorism attack or infectious disease outbreak, millions of potential victims may require rapid and efficient testing to ensure delivery of life-saving therapeutic treatment to those who need it. Because today there is no diagnostic method capable of high-performance large-scale testing in a crisis situation, thousands could die needlessly due to inefficient targeting of precious medical resources. To address the critical gap in the nation's public health preparedness for large-scale surge testing we propose to develop the MultiPath Surge Testing Platform and the MultiPath Anthrax Test.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will build, field test, and prepare for commercialization, a prototype industrial tub grinder with integrated high inertia flywheel technology that will reduce the consumption of diesel fuel in recovering woody biomass. Low-weight, high-inertia flywheel technology can significantly assist the diesel engine duty cycle such that more production can be had with the same amount of diesel fuel consumed. This will in effect lower the cost of grinding woody resources as measured by cost per ton. Each year in the United States alone, an estimated 157 millions of gallons of diesel fuel are consumed in the processing of recovering woody waste streams. The woody waste streams have value in the forms of renewable energy source for electricity co-generation, potential feed stock for cellulose ethanol, engineered wood products such as particle board and press-forms, compost, landscape mulch, and other soil amendments. The USDA estimates that only 5% of the total available woody resources in the United States are currently being utilized. It is expected that recovering woody resources will grow as a source of green, renewable, carbon neutral energy source in the future and hence the need to lower the cost of processing.  The drive to conserve energy and reduce the United States\ndependence on foreign oil will require a national effort on many different fronts, with each small efficiency gain contributing to that overall goal. The Phase 1 supporting research for this Phase 2 project indicates that a theoretical efficiency gain of 20% is possible with this technology. This Phase 2 project will reduce the diesel fuel consumption and hence total cost of the processing of woody biomass into useful forms. Developing this flywheel technology will make the woody waste stream more viable for energy generation including electricity and cellulose derived ethanol feedstock, reduce the nation's diesel fuel consumption, and it will make the companies involved in grinding woody wastes more profitable and productive. In addition to the impact this technology will have on recovering woody biomass, there are other markets where intermittent diesel engine duty cycles can benefit from developing high inertia flywheel technology. Concrete recycling, rock crushing, automobile shredding, and scrap tire recycling are market examples that can also benefit from adding low-weight, high-inertia flywheel technology to those equipment drive trains. It is expected that the technology developed and commercialized in this project will be applied towards those other markets.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Airborne particulate matter (PM) derived from a variety of natural sources (volcanic activity, forest fires) is omnipresent. However, human activity since the industrial revolution and the advent of the internal combustion engine has substantially increased the concentration of PM, particularly in urban areas. Human derived PM tends to be of smaller size, facilitating entry into the body through the respiratory and digestive tracts, as well as through the skin. It also tends to have adsorbed chemical species with greater toxicity than its natural counterparts. The explosive growth of nanotechnology in research and consumer products (sunscreens, cosmetics, paint) is also creating an array of ultrafine materials with largely unknown health effects. Despite numerous studies implicating PM in various disorders including acute respiratory infections, lung cancer, and chronic respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, the specific biological mechanisms involved are not fully understood. Adarza BioSystems, Inc. seeks to leverage its proprietary Arrayed Imaging Reflectometery (AIR) biosensing platform to build a device capable of rapidly capturing the detailed physiological response to PM exposure by profiling key marker proteins (potentially gt100) in conveniently available biosamples such as a finger pick of blood, urine, mucous, saliva, etc. Currently, such testing takes hours and is often done with individual singleplex tests. AIR is capable of sensitive and simultaneous protein detection with a device that is currently the size of a laptop computer. The goal of this proposal is to take our multiplexed laboratory assay, and seal it in a protective plastic cartridge so that fieldwork in unpredictable and unprotected environments would become realistic. We intend to collaborate with a company that has a long track record in building portable bioassays to military specifications to facilitate this development effort. An improved optical reader will also be designed with an integrated processing unit to control fluidic operations within the cartridge. Finally, a bank of ~1800 samples used in the previous population study will be tested using both the newly developed AIR bioassay and a more standard laboratory assay to verify the performance and of the AIR bioassay system. By the end of this 2-year project we intend to have a field deployable prototype and assay cartridges that are ready for large population studies.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Particulate matter (PM) is a major concern in the field of environmental medicine because exposure to small particles through air, water, or contact is unavoidable and these materials are known to enter the body through the respiratory and digestive tract, and even through skin. Exposure to PM has been linked to a variety of respiratory, inflammatory, and cardiac disorders, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Adarza Biosystems, Inc. seeks to integrate its rapid and highly multiplexed protein profiling technology, in a field- deployable system capable of measuring a participant's physiological response to particulate matter or other environmental stressors in large population studies.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A biofilm is an accumulation of microorganisms (e.g. bacteria, fungi, etc.) embedded in a polysaccharide matrix and adherent to a solid substrate. Biofilms are of particular interest in the clinical sciences, as they account for over 80% of microbial infections in the body. These infections can present themselves in the oral cavity, gastrointestinal tract, urogenital tract, and in the lung tissue of cystic fibrosis patients. Despite their widespread prevalence, biofilms remain a very difficult target to study in-vitro, and this has severely limited the development of effective anti-microbial drug compounds. Fluxion Biosciences proposes a high throughput instrument for biofilm analysis. This is a Phase 2 application, following successful completion of the great majority of milestones in the Phase 1 feasibility study. Based on the Company's unique microfluidic technology platform, the instrument would be capable of running 48 simultaneous biofilm experiments under continuous flow. The results will be assayed using standard microplate readers for improved throughput. This represents a considerable breakthrough over existing technologies, which are largely confined to singe-test experiments or well-plate assays with lower physiological relevance. Fluxion's approach involves coupling the advantages of flow-cell chambers (high biological relevance) with the convenience and throughput of traditional well plates. The resultant product will deliver a fully automated platform for biofilm research and anti-microbial drug discovery. Along with convenience and throughput, this system will deliver powerful features specific to biofilm analysis and drug discovery. These include a microfluidic dilution system for performing multiplexed dose-response analyses on anti-microbial compounds. The proposed system will be a simple to use, automated benchtop platform which will have a significant impact on the study of biofilms, the disease conditions where they are found, and the drug compounds which are needed to address them in the clinical setting. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Biofilms account for over 80% of microbial infections in the human body, and are a primary determinant in infections found in the oral cavity, gastrointestinal tract, urogenital tract, and lung tissue of cystic fibrosis patients. Despite their widespread clinical impact, testing of antibiotic compounds against bacteria in the biofilm state is a recent development, and the scientific instrumentation and screening tools available to study biofilms are severely limited. Researchers are limited to low throughput single test experiments, or well-plate based assays with much lower clinical significance because of limits of flow based systems that apply physiological shear and nutrient delivery. Fluxion Biosciences' proposes a way to perform biofilm assays using a microfluidic format which can deliver higher throughput while maintaining its biological relevance. This Phase 2 application is aimed at developing a fully automated robotic screening station in order to determine the efficacy of antibiotic compounds as applied to biofilms.",

High current pulses are widely used in injector systems for electron accelerators, both for industrial linacs as well as for high-energy accelerators for linear colliders. Also, short-duration pulses have been used for microwave generation, in klystrons and related devices, for injectors to perform research on advanced methods of particle acceleration, and for injectors used as free-electron-laser (FEL) drivers.  This project will develop a high current, picosecond S-band injector system, the Micro-Pulse Amplified Electron Injector (MPAI), based on a self-bunching electron gun, the Micro-Pulse Gun (MPG).  In Phase I, electron amplification with diamond in the MPG was demonstrated, and measurements of electron current gain, charge per bunch, RF power, beam power, and other key parameters were performed.  Phase II will involve the design, fabrication, and testing of an S-band MPAI to 5-6 MeV.  Experiments will be conducted to establish the baseline for characterizing the device, and the MPAI\u00bfs suitability for a variety of potential applications will be validated.

Commingled chipped whole plant materials have little value other than as compost, mulch and direct combustion energy. Capture of clean wood fiber from commingled shredded and chipped wood will increase the fiber supply to composite wood products facilities which manufacture particle board, fiberboard and related products and thus improve their sustainability in a time when traditional sawmill sources for fiber are in decline. Reprocessing chipped logging and forest management slash into higher value intermediate products improves the return from forest management and has the potential to reduce the public cost of stewardship and wildfire protection projects. Separation of the bark and wood content of commingled woody biomass feedstocks may improve the yield of second generation transportation liquid fuel processes and improve the economics of producing both residential and industrial grade solid fuel pellets.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As a start-up high-RF-technology company with an outstanding core of technical personnel Quality Electrodynamics (QED) has the mission to be the first industrial group to design, prototype, test, and manufacture in large quantities new  miniature  preamplifiers in Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) compliance for utilization as components in the MRI medical systems industry. One of the fastest growing clinical applications in this powerful medical imaging modality is the so-called parallel imaging method where multiple receive coils are used in simultaneous signal processing to speed up imaging. The ability to reduce imaging time by a factor of 4 or more without a serious compromise of image quality is very important for patient comfort and picture fidelity. Examples are the reduction of blurring for human anatomies in motion, such as the heart and lung, and the time required for certain scanning procedures where the patients must hold their breath. To take full advantage of highly parallel imaging and the concomitant enhancement of disease diagnostics such as detection of cancer, large numbers of RF coils are required. As many as 128 receiver-channel coils have been combined in some systems presently under study, and next-generation high-end commercial MRI systems are expected to be equipped with at least 16 channels with which new RF coil products need to interface. Perhaps one of the biggest challenges in building these complex RF coils and their internal circuits is the size of the preamplifiers to be integrated in each coil. There is no existing commercial preamplifier small enough for the large numbers of channels envisioned. Preamplifiers in MRI are different from other technical areas because of the need for low-input impedance (5 Ohms or less), nonmagnetic materials (to reduce image distortion), extremely low-noise figures, and robustness in the 64-300 MHz frequency range. In QED's mission to develop what is needed for the many-channel RF system, their core competency is perfectly positioned 1) to design and optimize the circuit, printed circuit board, and selection of sourcing components and external contract manufacturing firms, 2) to test a complete list of quality and safety factors including noise figure, stability, low-input impedance and linearity tests using network analyzers, spectrum analyzers and specialized test setups. The extensive criteria for this evaluation have been delineated in our Phase I work, and the Phase II project target is to perform applied RandD to position the company in Phase III as a high-quality, high volume manufacturer. The long-term goal is to become a platinum-standard main supplier of new high-quality low- noise miniature preamplifiers for the MRI hardware industry. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will prepare a manufacturing model for uniquely small preamplifiers that are a critical component for cutting edge magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technology. Preamplifiers are needed to increase the signal from the detection coils surrounding the patient in constructing diagnostics images. The current trend in MRI is to increase the number of these detection coils to reduce scanning time and increase image clarity. Faster scanning times result in more patients per day per machine, which directly results in MRI accessibility to a larger number of patients, faster/more accurate diagnostics, and a more comfortable imaging experience for patients-thus lowering costs and increasing the overall quality of health care. As the number of detection coils is increased, this also enables more widespread use of MRI in surgery, radiotherapy, cardiac imaging, and certain mammography procedures. But there is a problem: with more detector coils comes the need for smaller preamplifiers that meet today's MRI system demands. This proposal by QED has laid out a robust plan to uniquely meet the challenge of building such new devices.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cigarette smoking has long been recognized as the most significant preventable cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Approximately 80% of current adult smokers began using cigarettes as adolescents. Because of the addictive nature of tobacco, prevention of smoking initiation is critical for individual and public health. Early intervention to prevent tobacco use is especially important in girls who are more likely than boys to be influenced by modifiable risk factors such as peer pressure, perceived social norms, negative affect, and low self-esteem. The purpose of this Phase II proposal is to produce an interactive video game to encourage girls to make sound and informed decisions concerning smoking, and thereby prevent initiation of smoking and subsequent nicotine addiction. Serious games employing interactive computer technology are uniquely suited to the delivery of smoking prevention education because information can be presented in an innovative, engaging manner that is familiar to children and adolescents. In Phase I, an executable prototype was developed and successfully tested for usability, satisfaction, and potential impact on knowledge and attitudes towards tobacco. The specific aims of this Phase II study are to: (1) produce a fully operational video game targeted to girls age 8-12 based on Phase I prototype and design document; (2) assess usability of the final game product; (3) evaluate the impact of game on anti-smoking knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs; (4) evaluate user satisfaction with the game. A multi-site field test of the game will be conducted in collaboration with a national nonprofit organization (Girls, Incorporated) serving girls across the US. Widespread distribution of the game, through traditional retail markets and education distribution channel is anticipated in Phase III. The video game market for girls is relatively untapped. A product targeted specifically to entertain girls, while providing a positive health message in a responsible social environment, has significant commercial value. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of this Phase II project is to produce an anti-smoking video game targeted specifically to young girls.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Peripheral artery disease and trauma are leading causes of morbidity and amputation in the United States. Recent advances in biomaterials provide for potential development of small diameter vascular grafts as a life-saving treatment. Development of a life-long graft (lt 6 mm id) requires a construct that will not cause significant blood clotting/thrombosis and allow biologic integration to sustain life-long performance. Gel-Del Technologies has developed and tested prototypes using a patented fabrication process with purified proteins, water, and other biochemicals to produce biomimetic vascular constructs (Gel-Del(R) VasoGraft ). Collagen and elastin proteins, along with the anti-clotting factor, heparin, are processed together with a scaffolding material to create a tubular construct (VasoGraft ). VasoGraft testing and recent SBIR Phase I and II studies demonstrate excellent bio- and hemocompatibility, including non-thrombosis, host tissue integration and in vivo patency, in tests continuing out past 150 days using a porcine femoral artery model. While the graft's lumen remains non-thrombogenic, significant intimal hyperplasia occurs in native artery anastomosis sites, an expected adverse response to surgical arterial transection. Because the graft functions well, it was hypothesized here that reduction of intimal hyperplasia allows long-term function and patency. Therefore, we have developed an additional component of the VasoGraft system, which incorporates drug (rapamycin) to inhibit smooth muscle cell proliferation in the native artery. In vitro drug elution profiles have been characterized, and incorporation of this drug-eluting component has led to increased length of graft patency in a porcine femoral artery model. This proposal will pursue the necessary steps to gain IDE approval to commence clinical trials with the VasoGraft System, including additional long-term porcine efficacy studies, biocompatibility and safety studies according to ISO 10993, and manufacturing scale-up. These studies will be executed as follows: Aim 1: Assess optimal dose of rapamycin within drug-eluting threads for reducing stenosis, and test this within the VasoGraft System under GLP conditions using the porcine femoral artery end-to-end anastomosis model out to 450 days. VasoGraft System will be made with scaleable manufacturing procedures. Aim 2: Complete manufacturing scale up, and perform biocompatibility/safety/stability testing required for IDE submission. Aim 3: Final preparation of IDE and submission to FDA. These aims will generate the necessary information to submit an IDE application for approval to test the VasoGraft in a clinical trial, designed to include 30 patients with a 6-month follow-up to address any safety issues. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Peripheral vascular disease and trauma is a prevalent cause of amputation for military personnel and general population in the United States. Current blood vessel graft replacements are inadequate, often leading to occlusion and graft failure. The development of a novel blood vessel graft, which can also be utilized at trauma and battlefield sites, will greatly enhance the lives of people suffering from PAD or trauma.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In each IVF cycle, a decision must be made as to which embryo(s) will be selected for transfer. This decision has a far reaching impact on the outcome of an IVF cycle, namely whether the embryo will develop into a healthy child. It is estimated that at least 50% of human embryos are affected by chromosomal abnormalities such as aneuploidy, and implantation of such embryos can lead to undesired outcomes such as failed implantation, spontaneous abortion, or birth of a trisomic offspring. Reproductive specialists have been increasingly turning to pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) in efforts to identify embryos with the best chance of developing into healthy children. However, current techniques are expensive, unreliable and typically test only a small selection of chromosomes. GSN has developed an innovative technology termed Parental SupportTM (PS) whose output is an in silico reconstruction of the embryonic DNA at thousands of loci with confidence exceeding 99%. This technology will, for the first time, allow IVF physicians to screen embryos for chromosomal abnormalities including aneuploidy, translocations and deletions across all 23 pairs of chromosomes with an error rate below 0.1%. The Phase I objective of this application is to integrate our PS technology with a new, highly parallelized custom Infinium-based genotyping platform to dramatically reduce costs that will, in turn, enable GSN to offer PGD service with superior accuracy, scope and at a cost equivalent to current, less reliable FISH methods. The new customized platform will then be applied in Phase II where we propose to evaluate the concordance between a new trophectoderm biopsy technique on day 5, traditional blastomere biopsy on day 3, and the actual child. The results from these studies will allow us to assess the value of the new biopsy technique, evaluate the largely unstudied phenomenon of embryo self-correction between day 3 and day 5, and provide IVF physicians with powerful and far-reaching knowledge about the developmental potential of each embryo.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overall goal of this proposal is to build on our understanding of the collection, processing and cryobiological characteristics of stem/progenitor cells recovered from extracted teeth with the ultimate culmination of these data to develop a cryobank of dental pulp derived stem cells (DPSCs) for research and/or potential transplant or other clinical utilization as a human cell product processed under current good tissue practice (cGTP) as described under 21 CFR 1271. Recent studies investigating this exciting source of post-natal stem cells have identified a population of clonogenic and highly proliferative cells derived from enzymatically digested dental pulp tissue (Gronthos et al., 2000; Perry et al., 2008). Results from these studies have indicated that these cells may have the potential to be utilized in stem cell mediated therapies as well as tissue engineering applications (Seo et al., 2005). To allow further study and potential therapeutic use of these cells, our group has begun to evaluate the ability of these cells and their respective tissues of origin to survive cryopreservation processing. Ideally, the optimum cryopreservation process will be straight forward and effective when applied to the tissue as a whole, with the idea that stem cells could be extracted post-thaw. The rationale for this would be to preserve clinical samples for subsequent stem cell recovery as it is reasonable to speculate that cryopreservation of tissues in the clinic will be more practical than direct primary isolation of stem cells, which would require additional equipment and personnel (Seo et al., 2005; Perry et al., 2008). A cryobank of these cells would add great flexibility to their use by allowing, among other things, shipment of cells to investigators and/or clinicians and adequate time for donor characterization and/or potential testing. To achieve this overall goal, we propose the following Specific Aims: (I) Final development of optimized, cGTP protocols for development of a tooth stem cell bank for distribution and use; (II) Final development cGTP protocols for cryobanking of tooth tissue for later stem/progenitor cell isolation and expansion; and (III) Development and validation of a closed container for packaging and distribution of cells for clinical use. The ultimate goal of the proposal is a cryobank of DPSCs or tissue with e90% consistent functional recovery of cells based on the most sensitive assays available when compared to their unfrozen counterparts. For Specific Aim III the goal will be an FDA approved packaging system useful for clinical utilization of stem/progenitor cells derived from teeth. This system will also be useful for other clinically relevant stem cell sources where smaller volumes are required.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stem cells can develop into different tissues types in the body.  Post-natal  or  adult  stem cells offer an alternative to obtaining stem cells from embryos. Such stem cells exist in human teeth, but more research is required before these cells can have direct clinical use. A bank of frozen stem cells from teeth would be ideal to facilitate this research. This proposed project would optimize methods for processing and freezing these cells for ease of distribution for research, testing, and eventually clinical use, as well as present the ability for one to store tissue from their own teeth for potential use of their own cells if/when needed.",

Adding 3D information to 2D gastrointestinal images will help clinicians to perceive the size and shape of diseased areas aiding more accurate diagnosis. Capsule endoscopy is a recent trend and is generating growing interest among manufacturers and medical practitioners. However, no 3D or 2D/3D combined image analysis tools have been developed to further the advantages of this technique. The advantages of the proposed novel 2D/3D hybrid technology include   Mutually augmented 2D/3D algorithms enabling faster and more reliable analysis of capsule images;   Rapid 3D reconstruction from 2D capsule images using improved shape from shading approach and 3D fly-through modeling using 3D registration;   Automated classification and detection algorithms to segment the video into different anatomic sections and detect ulcers, bleeding, and other abnormalities in less time;   Interactive graphical user interface and 2D/3D visualization capability;   Modular and open software design architecture. According to Given Imaging Ltd., more than 820,000 patients worldwide have gone through capsule endoscopy procedure using their PillCam capsules. Capsule endoscopy is a rapidly-growing million-dollar market. The 2D/3D hybrid software system developed under this SBIR project will be the first software tool that utilizes both 2D and 3D information to rapidly and accurately diagnose abnormalities from capsule endoscopic images. The commercialization potential of the proposed system and technology is significant.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia (SZ) is a severely debilitating mental illnesses. It is highly heritable, with concordance rates of 50-80% in monozygotic twins and substantial familial clustering. Phenomenology-based diagnostic systems in psychiatry have serious limitations resulting in classifications lacking clear boundaries and biological basis. With respect to SZ, there is extensive overlap with other disorders on many dimensions, including symptoms, neurophysiology, brain imaging, cognition, and pharmacotherapy. Our eventual goal is to develop a novel product termed  Phyziotype , which will substantially improve the diagnosis of SZ by accessing the substantial contribution (50-80%) of genetic factors to the disease. The Phyziotype consists of a multi-gene ensemble of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) which, interpreted with a biomathematical algorithm, may predict the onset of SZ, more clearly delineate its diagnosis from related disorders, and distinguish between potential etiological subtypes. This Phase II Program is concerned with the discovery of the MRI DNA markers that form the foundation of the Phyziotype. The discovery of predictive biomarkers through association studies based on conventional psychiatric phenotypes has been limited by clinical confounders and the small effect sizes for individual markers. We hypothesize that  endophenotypes , known subclinical vulnerability phenotypes, are more strongly associated to individual genes than clinical observations, and provide a powerful tool to discover predictive biomarkers. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the brain is a versatile technique for measuring important psychiatric endophenotypes. This Program will utilize fMRI endophenotypes for association screening with total genome SNP arrays to identify MRI DNA markers relevant to the diagnosis of SZ. These biomarkers will advance our understanding of genetic risk factors and neurophysiology and may stimulate novel approaches to pharmaceutical development by refining psychiatric diagnosis. This Phase II program integrates the substantial physiogenomic capabilities of Genomas with the leading fMRI research of Dr. Godfrey Pearlson of Hartford Hospital's Institute of Living and the advanced neuroinformatics capabilities of Dr. Vincent Calhoun at the MIND Institute and the University of New Mexico. With ready access to a rich patient population at the Institute of Living and the MIND Research Network, the team has already integrated neuroimaging and physiogenomics as a novel platform for molecular analysis of mental illness, leading to two publications in 'Human Brain Mapping' and 'Annals of Biomedical Engineering'. This Phase II SBIR Program extends these studies to include 500 SZ patients and 250 healthy controls. All participants will be genotyped for 1,072,820 SNPs and 13,298 copy number variants using total genome arrays. Focused and Hypothesis-free Modes of physiogenomic analysis with fMRI endophenotypes will be used to discover MRI DNA markers for SZ. Physiogenomic models incorporating multiple SNPs will be developed as research prototypes for a Phyziotype system. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Schizophrenia (SZ) is a severely debilitating mental illnesses, currently afflicting 2.4 million American adults. The Phase II program will utilize fMRI endophenotypes and total genome SNP screening to identify MRI DNA markers relevant to schizophrenia. MRI DNA markers will eventually allow the development of systems that refine the clinical diagnosis of mental illness and may predict the individual susceptibility to schizophrenia and other disorders. The development of the actual diagnostic product will be pursued during Phase III as an FDA-approved diagnostic system for personalized mental health.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We describe here a Phase II Competitive Renewal grant application, which will support a three year program of ASHI (American Society of Histocompatibility and   Immunology) and FDA 510K review, for the  HLA-Chip  which we have developed over the past two years, with Phase II SBIR support. The deliverable at the end of year three of this Competitive Continuation will be a product platform that has been approved for very high throughput, microarray-based HLA typing, at the DNA level, in support of ASHI and FDA validated organ and marrow transplantation. However, we argue that the product will have been delivered at a cost that is low enough and with processing throughput that is high enough, that the same clinically approved HLA-Chip will stand ready to support a much broader future role for HLA screening medicine: for applications such as cancer risk screening, vaccine response screening, and microbial sensitivity screening, for neonates, for the military, and for civilian adults. Thus, at a somewhat higher level of abstraction, we argue that HLA-typing via the HLA- Chip can be viewed as a generalized prototype for all of complex medical allelotyping: as foreseen in gene- based personalized medicine, gene-based in vitro diagnostics, and gene-based public health screening. To assist in that critical and complex clinical approval process, we have obtained the collaborative support of Dr. Tony Lam, an expert in the FDA approval process, with special expertise in microarray-based IVDs; Dr. Paul Dunn, ASHI director for the New Zealand Blood Service HLA-typing laboratory, and Dr. Kamala Balakrishnan, former Chair of the ASHI Accreditation Committee, and past President of ASHI.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The specific focus of this Phase II Competing Renewal is to obtain both ASHI certification (as a service offering) and FDA 510K approval for the HLA-Chip, to support generalized HLA-typing. The specific, clinically validated applications for such generalized HLA-typing in the present practice of medicine and public health are solid organ and bone marrow transplantation and so, to begin with, the ASHI and FDA approvals that we seek will allow the HLA-Chip to be used in those two specific contexts.    However, the current understanding of vaccine risk response, as championed by our collaborators at Mayo (Dr Poland) and others, suggests that the gene content of the HLA-Chip that we will submit for review by ASHI and by the FDA (A,B,C,DRB1,DQA,DQB,DPA andDQB) will be very similar, if not identical to the HLA-Chip that will be needed to support vaccination medicine, once HLA typing has been validated as a critical component of the practice of vaccination medicine. We argue that, having obtained ASHI and FDA approval for the HLA-Chip for organ, marrow and stem cell transplantation, the necessary follow-on approvals for the HLA- Chip for vaccine treatment, will be greatly facilitated. The idea of such equivalence between transplantation and vaccination applications for the HLA-Chip has been nicely validated in our preliminary discussions with the FDA.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adenovirus vectors (Advectors) designed to express an antigenic gene have shown great promise as vaccines. Although GenVec and other groups have constructed numerous Advectors expressing a variety of antigens a substantial subset of antigen genes have been found to be inhibitory to Advector construction and production. This limitation was resolved in our phase I research by blocking antigen expression with a repressor system that is over 50-fold stronger than the commonly used TetR system. The technology was demonstrated to be applicable to multiple serotype groups of Advectors. In this phase 2 SBIR grant application we propose to use our optimized repressor to make a production cell line that is broadly applicable to vaccine vectors based on different human serotype groups and encoding inhibitory antigens. At the end of this phase 2 research a cell line certified ready for use in GMP banking will be available. No such cell line presently exists. The strategy to make the preferred repressor cell line is described in the three aims of this proposal. In Aim 1 the preferred repressor cell line with an optimized expression cassette will be constructed. Development of an optimized expression cassette is required to circumvent the epigenetic silencing found with the expression cassette used in our phase 1 research. In Aim 2 the preferred repressor cell line will be identified and certified for use in GMP banking. Since it is anticipated that Advector vaccines will be produced in suspension cells for commercial purposes, in Aim 3 we will demonstrate that the preferred repressor cell line can be adapted to grow in suspension and support production of Advectors from multiple serotype groups with inhibitory antigens. The final GMP manufacturing cell line will speed and facilitate the testing of Advector vaccine concepts for many antigens, hasten their progress to clinical testing and reduce the cost of goods for future approved vaccine products. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Adenovirus vector-based vaccines show great promise for protecting against many human diseases. However, some promising vaccines can not be made. In this proposal we overcome this limitation by developing a cell line that ensures any Adenovirus vector vaccine can be produced.",

        "abstract": "The intellectual merit of this Phase I SBIR research is the development of a biocatalyst for the commercial production of isobutanol using molecular techniques.  During Phase I of this proposal, a bacterial microorganism was engineered that produced isobutanol at reasonably high rates and reaching high concentration, indicating that a biotechnological process for the production of isobutanol is feasible.  During Phase II research, any limitation to biocatalyst productivity will be removed using molecular techniques resulting in a microorganism that produces isobutanol at a rate that allows for economically competitive production of isobutanol.  The broader impacts of this Phase II SBIR research will be reneweable isobutanol produced for both the transportation fuel market as well as the chemical market.  Higher alcohols, such as butanol and isobutanol that can be produced from the same biomass as ethanol are attractive second-generation biofuels due to their higher energy content and their low hygroscopicity.  Successful completion of the Phase II work will help enable a process for the biotechnological production of isobutanol that is economically competitive with the petrochemical market.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High Voltage Compact Capacitor for Implantable Defibrillator: Worldwide, sudden cardiac arrest is a major health problem. The use of Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators (ICD) has become an increasingly accepted treatment option, one that could save thousands of heart attack patients annually. With the increase in acceptance of these devices, the drive for improvement of function and materials has intensified. One of the most critical and vital components of the ICD device is a high-voltage capacitor. The function of the capacitor is to store energy over a period of seconds and deliver it to the heart over a period of a few milliseconds. The overall goal of the proposed project is to develop an integrated and unitized (all elements in intimate contact), miniaturized, and all-solid high-voltage capacitor for the next generation of implantable defibrillators. The all-solid high-voltage capacitor is attractive because it can store several times as much energy as a conventional electrolytic capacitor, while retaining the ability to deliver that energy at high discharge rates. It will also allow the stacking of multi-cell units in series in the same package, something not possible in the case of the liquid electrolyte, which requires complicated packaging. This will reduce the number of required capacitors inside the ICD to two, reduce the ICD weight and volume by replacing liquid electrolyte with solid electrolyte, permit use of a bipolar multi-cell series design to achieve high voltages, and, eliminate any possibility of shunt currents and electrolyte leakage, thereby enhancing reliability and safety. The feasibility to develop an advanced miniaturized and all-solid high-voltage capacitor for the next generation of implantable defibrillators was demonstrated in Phase I. Improved tantalum anode formation processes enabled us to form anode components successfully at high voltages up to 350 V, which lead us to believe that even higher voltage can be achieved. During this Phase II program, it is proposed to build full-size 700-V stacks to be studied under long-term and accelerated test conditions. Based on the Phase I results, the technical approach for the Phase II product development program will include 1) further optimization of the tantalum anode structure b) fabricate final cell stacks, evaluate capacitor housings, encapsulation materials, and procedures, b) perform long-term stability and biocompatibility tests, and to, c) Study and select sterilization and packaging options. The successful completion of the Phase II project will result in a miniaturized capacitor and a method of fabricating a novel all-solid capacitor which will have applications for ICDs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The use of Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators (ICD) has become an increasingly accepted treatment option, one that could save thousands of heart attack patients annually. There is critical need for reduced size, high energy density capacitor for the ICD. Substantial reduction in the volume and consequently weight of the capacitor inside the ICD would represent a significant product improvement ICD resulting in many advantages for the patients.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The toxicity of trace heavy metals found in drinking water, food, and the environment is an area of increasing national and international concern. Heavy metals are significant environmental pollutants because they tend to persist, tend to bioaccumulate and can result in serious adverse health effects when ingested or inhaled. Measurement of human exposure in the population serves in determination of safe regulatory exposure limits and prevention of diseases caused by heavy metals. Trace metals can be measured in human tissue or fluids such as blood or urine in centralized laboratories using complex analytical methods such as high-performance liquid chromatography inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy. However, in view of the high labor and analytical costs and long time delays associated with centralized laboratory analyses, there is an immediate need for a portable and inexpensive system for on-site monitoring of human exposure to heavy metals. The overall objective of this project is to develop a portable, self-contained, easy-to-use monitor for simultaneous on-site measurement of arsenic, cadmium, manganese and lead metals from a single urine sample, in near real time, to assess personal exposure. The proposed sensor combines a specialized electrochemical measurement technique with a unique microarray electrode material and configuration for unprecedented sensitivity and selectivity, under real-world operating conditions. During Phase I, Giner, Inc. developed sensor design configurations, electrode material compositions, and operating conditions which demonstrated the feasibility of the unique microchip sensor prototype for the detection of arsenic and cadmium species at 0.2 ppb level in water. Testing in urine is ongoing in the Phase I program, with arsenic and cadmium detected in the initial studies at 100 ppb with a response magnitude indicating a lower detection limit will be attained in the last four months of Phase I. The Specific Aims of this intensive Phase II program encompass design, fabrication and validation testing of a prototype field-portable analytical system for detection of a broader range of heavy metals (including arsenic, cadmium, manganese and lead) at concentrations in the relevant ppb and sub-ppb levels in water and in urine. The performance of the monitor will be extensively characterized for sensitivity, selectivity, robustness and ease-of-use in real-world samples and field situations. During the Phase II program, five prototype compact packaged units will be fabricated for use in ongoing epidemiological studies in three field locations (Bangladesh, Tar Creek, OK and Mexico City) in collaboration with Harvard School of Public Health. Subsequent to Phase II, the five prototypes will be ready for use in additional field research prior to its introduction as a commercial product for multiple markets in research, environmental and health monitoring.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Human exposure to toxic heavy metals is common in the U.S. and internationally with serious adverse health effects. This Phase II SBIR research is for development a portable monitor for measuring toxic metals (arsenic, cadmium, lead and manganese) in the urine as a way to rapidly, inexpensively assess personal exposure. A portable field monitor will facilitate the ease, rapidness and cost-effectiveness of public health monitoring and research studies to understand the relationship between chemical exposure and disease outcomes.",

Specifically, we will develop the MMPA assays (one for each type of cancer) for analysis of DNA methylation in colorectal, lung, and breast cancer, the three deadliest cancers, respectively. Each assay can simultaneously determine the methylation status of 20 genes in a 10,000 fold excess of unmethylated DNA. The assays can also determine the degree of methylation and the relative abundance of methylated genes in clinic specimens. In addition, the assays will be cost-effective and easy to operate. The goal of Phase I is to determine if the MMPA assay can accurately reveal methylation in DNA derived from clinic samples. Experimentally, we will use our existing MMPA assay to profile the methylation status of eight genes in DNA derived from stools, the most complex specimen. The specific milestone is to demonstrate that this assay can achieve the detection sensitivity and specificity of 90% or better, respectively. Phase II is to develop the MMPA assays for analysis of DNA methylation in colorectal, lung, and breast cancers, respectively. Each MMPA assay  fires one shot  to  kill four birds . First, the assay can determine the methylation status of an individual gene; second, the assay profiles DNA methylation among a number of genes; third, the assay has the capability of determining the degree of methylation of methylated genes; and fourth, the assay provides insights into the abundance of methylated genes in clinical specimens.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Phase I resulted in our discovery of low nanomolar level inhibitors of ADP-induced human platelet aggregation, with a unique mechanism of action, that warrant further development as first-in-class antithrombotic drugs. We developed a novel, efficient, high yield method to prepare a series of base and phosphate modified derivatives of diadenosine tetraphosphate (Ap4A). The proposed modifications revealed clear structure-activity trends, and led to the synthesis of highly potent inhibitors of human platelet aggregation that are also stable in plasma. We investigated for the first time the mechanism of action of this class at the level of the three platelet purinoreceptors (P2X1,P2Y1 and P2Y12), and showed that Ap4A and its analogs antagonize both P2Y1 and P2Y12. Moreover this unprecedented simultaneous inhibition of both platelet ADP dependent platelet receptors by a single ligand appears to be highly synergistic - IC50'sfor inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation for the most active compounds is one to two order of magnitude lower than the corresponding IC50'sof inhibition of P2Y1 and P2Y12. Thus these compounds represent a new class of antiplatelet, and, ultimately, antithrombotic drugs with a novel mechanism of action. The specific aims are to 1, expand and tune the structure:activity relationship for inhibiting human platelet aggregation by synthesis and study of six additional Ap4A analogs, 2, evaluate the selectivity/specificity of the new class of Ap4A derivatives, by studying and quantifying the ability of 3-6 most active compounds to interact with non-platelet P2 receptors, utilizing tissue and recombinant receptor models, 3, optimize and scale up the chemical process of synthesis and purification of the class; 4, determine the basic pharmacokinetic parameters and identify metabolites of the 3 lead compounds candidates after IV administration in rats, and 5, study the aggregation properties of platelets after IV infusion of these candidates in catheterized rats, and 6, confirm the antithrombotic activity of the selected lead compound in the well-established Folts' canine thrombosis model. A single lead preclinical compound (plus backup) will be designated following these studies. Platelets play critical roles in hemostasis and its pathophysyology. Undesired platelet activation is a result of many common pathologies, e.g. hypertension and arteriosclerosis, and leads to excessive platelet aggregation and the generation of occlusive thrombi (thrombosis). The ischemic events that follow, such as myocardial infarction and stroke, are leading causes of death in the developed world, and antiplatelet drugs have been a major focus of drug development. Aspirin and clopidrogel (Plavix(R),  5.9B sales in 2005) are the most popular of the class today. Because of the vast interpatient variability in response to clopidogrel and newer single-receptor targeted drugs under clinical development, and because of the increased bleeding and morbidity in patients receiving clopidogrel, there is a need for the development of fast, direct acting, and rapidly cleared platelet ADP-receptor antagonists. The overall goal of this research is to identify a novel lead antithrombotic compound for human use, which can be licensed to a major pharmaceutical company for further pre-clinical and clinical development, or alternatively can be developed into a drug candidate by us after securing appropriate partnership or funding.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will result in an effective antithrombotic drug that will be used to treat arterial thrombosis in the acute setting. The candidate drug will directly and reversibly inhibit two important receptors involved in platelet aggregation, and will not have the drawbacks of slow and variable action of current drugs such as clopidogrel. The new drug will complement related drugs under development for arterial thrombosis.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetes is a major healthcare problem that is reaching crisis proportions, and new therapies are urgently needed. We are developing a long-term glucose sensor with battery-operated telemetry for implantation in subcutaneous tissues. The sensor would have unique applications in type 1 diabetes for hypoglycemia warning, insulin dosing, and control of the artificial pancreas. The sensor may also have application for glucose monitoring in type 2 diabetes, caloric and activity management in obesity, and prevention of type 2 diabetes in susceptible individuals. Development of the long-term implantable glucose sensor has been underway for several years. Previous studies have focused on the development of individual sensor components including: stable preparations of immobilized glucose oxidase and catalase, novel membranes with controlled permeability, electrochemical detectors, implantable electronics and telemetry, signal processing methods, and the hermetic implant housing. Sensors incorporating these components have been tested extensively in vitro and have proven stable. The sensors were tested extensively as short-term implants in rodents to determine the effects of micro-vascular perfusion and mass transfer resistance, leading to minor adjustments in sensor design. In Phase I of this project, the sensor and telemetry system were implanted for 12-18 months in pigs, and results demonstrated that the sensor remains responsive and capable of monitoring blood glucose for extended periods. In addition to the long-term animal performance evaluations, appropriate biocompatibility and other pre- clinical testing has also been completed. In this project, we will now carefully verify that acceptable sensor performance can be obtained in two small-scale pilot human clinical trials, and we will develop patient-friendly instructions for sensor operation, including calibration method and interval. Detailed assessments of sensor accuracy, lag, and sensitivity stability will also be conducted to determine suitability of the device for future use in closed-loop applications. The long-term implantable glucose sensor has an important role in the therapy for diabetes and obesity. The sensor we are developing has undergone systematic engineering analysis, extensive short-term animal tests, and long-term animal implant studies. This project comprises the necessary last steps prior to evaluation of the sensor in large-scale clinical trials.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Diabetes is a major healthcare problem that is reaching crisis proportions, and new therapies are urgently needed. In long-term animal implant tests, we have demonstrated operation of a new glucose sensor that would have unique applications in diabetes for hypoglycemia warning, insulin dosing, and control of the artificial pancreas.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Increasing use of intravascular (IV) catheters put patients at risk for catheter occlusion as well as systemic infections. Failure to prevent and treat device-related infections is due to the ability of microorganisms (fungi and bacteria) to produce biofilms, resulting in catheter-associated infection and occlusion. Biofilms formed on catheters are complex structures composed of host-derived fibrin deposits and stranding as well as pathogen- derived, extracellular polysaccharide-rich matrix. There is a significant unmet need to prevent and treat biofilm- related infections. To address this unmet need, in this SBIR application, we will develop and commercialize an antibiofilm product that possesses anti-biofilm and anti-coagulation/anti-catheter occlusion properties. Our product, B-LockTM, discovered using our previously established in vitro and in vivo assays meets the above criteria. We demonstrated that B-LockTM has broad-spectrum activity against biofilms formed by clinically relevant pathogens, both in vitro and in vivo, and also possesses anti-coagulant activity. Since the last submission, we successfully identified six prototype formulations that remained physically and chemically stable for several months, showed that clinical candidate was active against biofilms in vitro and in vivo, including biofilms formed by fluconazole-resistant C. albicans and C. parapsilosis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE).  In this Fast-Track SBIR application, we propose a two-phase plan to develop B-LockTM as a product directed at prevention and treatment of CRBSIs and occlusion.  Phase 1 of this SBIR application describes in vivo efficacy testing, stability testing, toxicology and compatibility studies, while Phase 2 details a clinical trial to test the safety and efficacy of B-LockTM. PHASE 1 SPECIFIC AIMS: The objective of Phase 1 of this Fast-Track application is to perform expanded in vivo efficacy testing, evaluate the in vitro activity of B-LockTM against biofilms formed by drug-resistant microorganisms, and determine the long-term stability of the clinical candidate.  Furthermore, we will also evaluate the safety profile of B-LockTM and determine its compatibility with catheter material. The following specific aims are proposed: Aim 1. Determine efficacy of clinical B-LockTM formulation in vivo. Aim 2. Evaluate long-term stability of B-LockTM. Aim 3. Evaluate the in vitro activity of B-LockTM against biofilms formed by drug-resistant microorganisms. Aim 4. Demonstrate that B-LockTM is safe and non-toxic in vivo. Aim 5. Demonstrate compatibility of B-LockTM with catheter materials. PHASE 2 SPECIFIC AIM. Conduct a randomized, double-blind clinical trial to evaluate B-LockTM solution compared with heparin lock solution in the preservation of in-dwelling catheter sterility and potency in patients receiving chemotherapy for hematologic malignancies.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Central venous catheters (CVCs) are essential tools for the appropriate treatment and support of patients with life-threatening diseases such as cancer and end-stage kidney failure. However, intravascular catheters put patients at risk for systemic infections, which are caused by microbial biofilms formed within the catheter lumens.  In this Fast-Track SBIR application, we propose a two-phase plan to develop an antibiofilm and anticoagulant product (B-LockTM) directed at prevention and treatment of CVC-associated infections and occlusion.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A Manual Standup Wheelchair Abstract Wheelchairs in the modern form have been around since at least 1760, when John Joseph Merlin invented pushrim propulsion. The Merlin Chair, as it was called, bears a remarkable resemblance to wheelchairs today, despite the intervening 240 years. Wheelchairs capable of erecting a user to the standing position have also been around for a long time, and have numerous physiological and psychological advantages, but to present, have required electric motor drive systems for movement while standing. This results in such wheelchairs being heavy and expensive. A standup wheelchair that is totally manually operated both in the erecting mechanism and the propulsion while standing would offer numerous benefits. The wheelchair presented in this proposal is designed to be lightweight, have a unique and innovative method of propulsion both seated and standing, incorporate drive ratio changing gearing for propulsion, have a very stable erection mechanism, and be aesthetically unobtrusive. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Where applicable, pushrim drive manual wheelchairs are the mobility solution of choice by users for their simplicity and intuitive utility, and are preferred by health care professionals for their health benefit. Thus, improvements of the manual drive wheelchair have occupied many researchers, and been funded by many agencies both private and governmental. Yet with all of this work, standup wheelchairs that provide for mobility while standing always have electric motor drives. To this time, lever drive systems have not been successfully adapted to the standup chair. They are considered too heavy, hard to learn to use, and most importantly aesthetically obtrusive. The use of the lever drive removes the weight penalty of battery sourced electric drive, and necessitates an erection mechanism that places the standing person within the chair wheelbase in order to maximize stability. Responding to the needs of this user population, this standup wheelchair incorporates a innovative lever drive system and a unique standup mechanism. The chair allows manual propulsion by a unique intuitive directional control concept that makes the lever drive available both sitting and standing. It is very light in weight, offers variable ratios to suit changing situations, and is unobtrusive. Additionally, this lever drive system does not interfere with propulsion by both pushrims, which are maintained in the conventional positions. The light weight of this fully mobile manual standup wheelchair opens the possibility of use by those who cannot, or prefer not to purchase an extra wheelchair, but would value the pain relieving, and injury preventive attributes of standing.",

        "abstract": "Highly productive, third-rotation commercial plantations have been successfully managed in the United States by the pulp and paper, timber, and the environmental-remediation industries for more than 40 years with great success in terms of wood yields and job creation. The success of the poplar plantation industry has consistently been shown to be dependent the propagation of elite varieties that have undergone hybridization and intense selection for improved agronomic characteristics. Hybrid poplar will similarly play a large role in the future supply of cellulosic energy feedstock as a key component of the Nation's 30x30 goals for the renewable transportation fuels industry. However a new class of poplar varieties of improved chemistry composition will be needed that are capable of bio-fuels manufacture with improved conversion economics. The breeding of such varieties will require the development and integration of novel molecular tools into existing traditional hybridization and varietal selection program. To accomplish this, GreenWood Resources currently conducting an association genetics study to identify genes controlling cellulose production in black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa) based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP's). We are now completing a comparative study with European black poplar (P. nigra) so as to augment GreenWood's conventional hybridization program for these two important poplar species using molecular markers and bioinformatics to improve biomass composition and the economics of liquid fuels conversion. (The goal is a re-designed reciprocal recurrent selection program for inter-sectional hybridization of P. trichocarpa and P. nigra. ) A large 612-genotype collection of P. nigra has been cloned and established at two contrasting locations in the Pacific Northwest. We have sequenced the same lignin and cellulose biosynthetic pathway genes identified in the P. trichocarpa study to discover new SNPs. We propose to: 1) Phenotype the 612 clones for an array of chemical and structural traits at each of the two locations, 2) Genotype the collection for important SNPs, and 3) Study the genotype-phenotype associations and the effect to which they interact with planting site. The comparative study in P. nigra will also provide insight into the pattern of genetic diversity between the two species from distinct sections of the genus. The comparison will also advance our understanding of the manner in which reciprocal parental populations should be managed as a marker-assisted breeding program for improved first-generation hybridization for enhanced bio-fuels application.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): DNA cloning, also known as gene splicing or recombinant DNA technology, underlies all of modern biomedical and biotechnology research. Yet DNA cloning frequently goes awry because this process involves a large number of variables, has many subtleties, and is hard to document with existing tools. DNA cloning is linked to a variety of other procedures, and researchers struggle to manage and integrate the resulting information. This situation impedes progress and forces scientists to divert attention from more creative activities. Well crafted software can solve these problems, but the currently available programs are ineffective at helping users to meet their goals. GSL Biotech is developing advanced software, provisionally named  Kamino , that streamlines the design, execution, and documentation of molecular biology projects. During Phase I, we created a working  alpha  prototype of Kamino. During Phase II, we will develop a finished software product. Aim #1 is to refine Kamino so that it provides comprehensive functionality while retaining an intuitive user interface. The alpha version of Kamino offers a responsive interface for visualizing and annotating DNA sequences, and for simulating common DNA manipulations. The software is designed so that users can achieve their goals quickly and without distraction. Future work will optimize existing functions for speed and flexibility, and will supply important additional functions. Aim #2 is to extend Kamino with additional modules, thereby creating an integrated multi- functional software suite. Kamino currently manages double-stranded DNA sequences. In addition to this  DNA  module, we will introduce an  Oligos  module for managing single-stranded oligonucleotides, a  Proteins  module for managing polypeptide sequences, an  Alignment  module for aligning DNA or protein sequences, a  Sequencing  module for assembling DNA contigs, and an  RNA  module for managing single- and double-stranded RNA molecules. Information transfer between the modules will be uniquely easy and transparent. The resulting integrated software suite will provide efficient data management for molecular biology projects. We anticipate that Kamino will substantially accelerate research and development, thereby boosting productivity. This innovation will make biomedical research more cost-effective. Our product will revolutionize DNA cloning by making the experts more efficient, and by enabling the novices to clone like today's experts. From an educational perspective, the intuitive and visually rich Kamino interface will be ideally suited to undergraduate-level instruction in molecular biology.

However, antifungal treatments are hampered by emerging resistance, toxicity concerns, lack of fungicidal activity, and narrow spectrum of action. Thus, there is a critical need for new antifungal drug targets, and new antifungal drug strategies. An important step in the identification of new targets for antifungal drug discovery is the use of in vivo genome profiling using appropriate diseased samples to identify fungal-specific genes which are required for infection. The Phase I application successfully utilized emerging technologies to identify C. albicans genes induced during murine oral candidiasis. Specifically, we identified a subset of: (i) in vivo expressed genes; (ii) infection and colonization-associated genes, and (iii) novel and fungal-specific genes that will likely play a role in the transition from comced targets identified during the Phase I research are required for oral infection. Specific C. albicans knockout strains will be generated and assessed for their ability to cause disease during oral candidiasis. Specific Aim 2 will demonstrate that oligonucleotides can function as antifungal agents against Candida species in vitro. Oligonucleotides will be designed against pre-existing antifungal drug targets and against infection- required targets identified in Specific Aim 1. The oligonucleotides will be preferentially designed against domains within the gene open reading frame that are conserved amongst pathogenic fungi. The antifungal capability of the oligonucleotides will be assessed specifically at the mRNA level, and analyzed for the corresponding alterations in growth, viability, or specific phenotype trait. Specific Aim 3 will demonstrate that the oligonucleotides can be used alone, and in combination with known antifungal agents, to treat murine oral candidiasis. The rese Mucosal candidiasis is the mostcommon type of Candida infection and occurs frequently in immunocompromised patients, and patients with an altered bacterial flora.

        "abstract": "The nations food supply is particularly vulnerable to a bioterrorist attack. Bacillus anthracis, the causative agent of anthrax, is a Category A pathogen that is considered a high priority biological weapon. Gastrointestinal anthrax is caused by the ingestion of B. anthracis contaminated foods or liquids. B. anthracis spores, which are the infectious form of the disease, are extremely resistant to chemical and physical treatment. Thus, minimally processed foods or liquids such as milk are the primary areas of concern because they do not receive the protective benefit of cooking. The risk is compounded because gastrointestinal anthrax is very difficult to diagnose since the disease has general symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea; if appropriate treatment is not administered within the first 24 h after exposure, the disease can develop into a systemic form that is rapidly fatal with mortality rates exceeding 40%. Consequently, novel surveillance methodologies that can detect B. anthracis on adulterated liquids and foods are critical for enhancing food safety. The long-term goal of our research is to develop a simple and rapid B. anthracis detection kit that can be used to identify this priority pathogen on deliberately contaminated foods or liquids. Our Phase I research obtained the proof of principle results by generating a genetically engineered reporter phage that could detect B. anthracis. The reporter phage was constructed by integrating the \"light\" genes into the genome of a B. anthracis phage. The resulting \"light-tagged\" reporter phage was able to rapidly (within minutes) confer a bioluminescent (light) signal to B. anthracis. The Phase II research will build upon the Phase I research by: 1: Demonstrating that the reporter phage can detect many different forms of B. anthracis. 2: Demonstrating that the reporter phage detects B. anthracis only, and not other non-pathogenic bacteria in order to reduce the possibility of false alarms. 3: Demonstrating that the reporter phage can detect B. anthracis on contaminated liquids and foods. The research proposed in this application is significant because it will potentially save lives by providing the surveillance methodology for the identification of B. anthracis on deliberately contaminated liquids and foods. The research will enhance food safety, but will also be directly beneficial to the Federal Government for the detection of anthrax-contaminated buildings and offices, and also to the clinical community as a diagnostic tool for the detection of B. anthracis.",

        "abstract": "For traveling wave electron linear accelerators, considerable difficulty has been encountered in demonstrating accelerating gradients in excess of 100 megavolts per meter.  Attempts to operate at higher gradients suitable for future linear colliders have resulted in radio-frequency breakdown and related surface damage.  In recent high-gradient accelerator tests using a resonant ring power amplifying system, an ability to minimize surface damage was demonstrated.  This result was achieved by automatically responding to a breakdown event with rapid re-routing of accelerator input power and immediate restriction of energy deposition.  In this project, this protection strategy will be combined with an advanced design structure to overcome the presently limited threshold of high gradient operation.  In Phase I, the conceptual layout and microwave design parameters of a high power dual resonant ring system were established.  During Phase II, the design and development of specialized high power components will be completed, the dual resonant ring system will be fabricated, and the overall system will be fine-tuned with a candidate high-gradient test structure embedded in the network.  Resonant ring high-power tests will be conducted, and the high gradient performance of the linac structure will be evaluated and compared with that of a directly driven structure. Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Success of the Phase II effort would lead to a better understanding of radio-frequency breakdown in traveling wave linear accelerators and would provide design guidance for further miniaturization of commercial accelerators for medical, radiographic, and homeland security applications.",

This project will build an innovative solution called CodeBook that utilizes Web 2.0 and Web 3.0 social networking and semantic analysis concepts.  In Phase I, a prototype CodeBook was developed and demonstrated to DOE employees and members of the computational community at SciDAC, NERSC, and three national laboratories.  In Phase II, the prototype will be expanded into a product designed to help bring about the transformation of the way in which computational-based methods are utilized.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The product developed under Phase II should promote collaboration among developers and users of computational packages, providing the following benefits:  (1) exponential content growth rather than incremental, (2) dramatic increase in availability of numerical software libraries, (3) site maintenance independent of the availability of a single person or the willingness of a given entity to donate that person\u00bfs time, and (4) improved quality of content as the result of peer reviews and contributions.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is a neurological disease caused by Flaviviruses of the tick-borne encephalitis group and causes death in up to 60% of the individuals developing clinical symptoms. Survivors often show severe long-term neurological sequelae. In addition to the classical viruses, the TBE complex of viruses also contains members that cause hemorrhagic fevers sometimes in combination with neurological symptoms. The infection is naturally transmitted via vector ticks in endemic areas. However, the highly infective viruses can also be transmitted via food or in aerosolized form. Therefore, development of a TBE virus vaccine is a NIH high-priority biodefense project (and as such listed in the NIAID Biodefense research agenda for category B and C pathogens. Currently available commercial vaccines based on inactivated whole virus are not registered in the U.S., show considerable vaccination side-effects and are labeled for use only against the less virulent Central European subtype. In the previous phase I SBIR project recombinant TBE subunit proteins were successfully produced in insect cells. The recombinant proteins showed very potent immunogenicity in mice when used with modern adjuvants. The leading formulations showed good efficacy in the mouse challenge models of Western and Far Eastern subtype TBE viruses. In addition, a preliminary study demonstrated that the leading vaccine candidate also confers complete protection against the more distantly related Omsk Hemorrhagic Fever virus. During the phase II project, the antigen manufacturing will be advanced and the necessary quality control steps implemented to progress with the scale-up of production. This will include safety testing of well-defined antigen in a rat toxicology study. Biological and physical assays to evaluate the response to the vaccines will be further developed and standardized. Those assays will be used to document the effect of antigen dosage in the leading vaccine formulation and evaluate the need for a third vaccination to achieve complete protection (in different mouse models). Another study will compare the potency of the recombinant TBE antigen with that of conventionally produced inactivated TBE virus. After refining the vaccine formulation, protective efficacy in mice against the more distant members of the TBE complex will be evaluated. Based on mouse studies the leading candidate will be tested in non-human primates to demonstrate safety and immunogenicity. Efficacy in primates will be demonstrated indirectly using well accepted passive protection studies in mice. The planned studies should complete the pre-clinical efficacy requirements and would therefore be an important step towards the clinical development of a novel TBE vaccine. A safe and efficacious vaccine based on recombinant subunit proteins would provide useful in protecting U.S. citizens from TBEV infection without the need of large-scale culture of highly infectious virus.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE - PROJECT NARRATIVE:  Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) viruses cause severe neurological disease or hemorrhagic fevers and survivors often show severe long-term neurological sequelae. Currently available commercial vaccines based on inactivated whole virus are not registered in the U.S., show considerable vaccination side-effects and are labeled for use only against the less virulent Central European subtype. This project is aimed to develop a safe and efficacious vaccine formulation based on a recombinant subunit protein which requires only two doses to provide broad protection against all members of the TBE complex to protect U.S. citizens from TBEV infection in endemic areas around the world.",

This system uses a refrigerant fluid (R134A) that is potentially harmful to the environment.  In fact, this fluid has been outlawed in Europe and likely will be outlawed in the United States soon.  In addition, the compression system is a high maintenance item, is noisy, vibrates, and is a significant power drain on the vehicle.  This project will develop a new type of thermoelectric, called quantum wells, a solid state means of cooling that does not use dangerous gases and can achieve cooling efficiencies that are equal to or better than vapor compression systems.  In Phase I, a working model was used to demonstrate that quantum-well thermoelectrics could be used to cool the interior of a truck, without any hazardous gases such as R134A.  The coefficient of performance was shown to be comparable to currently used vapor compression cycles, without the attendant high maintenance and noise.  Phase II will design, fabricate, and test a complete prototype system.Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Applications for the new cooling system include trucks and automobiles.  Savings in fuel consumption, elimination of refrigerant leakage, reduction in noise and vibration, and reduction in overall maintenance costs would be among the chief benefits.

Current easily deployable cryostat technology required to reach the ultra-cold operating temperatures of TES arrays (50 to 100 mK) can not cope with the size or the heat load of kilopixel arrays. The housings and shielding required to support such arrays have masses of several (~5) kilograms. Also, the heat load of several hundred wires traveling from room temperature down to the TES arrays in addition to the self-heat generated by the array itself (e.g., bias currents) is significant. By solving these issues in a compact system with the minimal amount of room temperature infrastructure, the Kilo Pixel Array Cryostat will eliminate a substantial barrier to the wide dissemination and use of NIST\u00bfs detector arrays in a variety of novel and critical applications.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II research project will further validate a groundbreaking wireless semiconductor platform that enables disposable, body-worn, physiological monitoring wireless sensors (wireless disposables) for a wide range of applications in healthcare and other industries. The company's chips are combined with today's body sensors such as electrocardiogram (ECG), Saturation of Peripheral Oxygen (SpO2), and blood pressure, to produce wireless disposables for continuous monitoring. For mass deployment, wireless disposables must displace today's wired sensors, therefore must have equally low cost, similar reliability, and days of operating life for a single use. Conventional radios are too unreliable, too power hungry and cause high interference to meet this challenge. The company is creating a single chip solution by combining radio with sensor functions providing a gain of 50X over conventional radio based solutions in terms of low power, low cost and wire-like reliability.  Eliminating the wires connecting a person's body to a patient monitor long held as impossible to replace could be possible with the proposed solution. Healthcare markets, the initial focus of the company (dominated by hospital use), represent more than a $2B market in disposables. The wireless disposables will\nhave a broad global impact by contributing to cost effective, high quality care in hospitals and other care settings. In hospitals, wireless disposables can eliminate reusable monitoring wires, products which have been demonstrated to carry drug resistant pathogens in up to 75% of cases. Wireless disposables are also aligned with a future vision of highly automated institutions that support a more natural workflow. Outside the hospital, wireless disposables allow remote and mobile monitoring of people with chronic diseases, enabling early interventions, an important goal in maintaining health and lowering costs. Wireless disposables will help solve the global healthcare crisis, with US costs over $1.5 trillion and rising rapidly as 78 million baby boomers near retirement.",

In this area of fusion research, the ability to compress a magnetized target plasma, without the need to replace a solid driver, is crucial to further development.  Mini-railgun plasma accelerators with low operating costs and high repetition rates are a possible approach to meeting this requirement.  Therefore, this project will develop mini-railgun plasma accelerators that can produce high density plasma jets at high velocity.  In Phase I, a series of prototype accelerators were designed, fabricated, and tested.  When four mini-railguns were used in a symmetric plane geometry, the resulting convergence density was a factor of 20 larger than the density of a single jet.  Small railguns (1 cm bore) achieved nearly 200 micrograms of plasma at 80 km/s with high energy density.  In Phase II, the mini-railgun accelerators will be further developed, pushing their performance to above 1000 micrograms of plasma at greater than 50 km/s, while maintaining the high density.  A fully three-dimensional jet merging and implosion test will be performed at modest energy using 20-26 mini-railguns.  These tests will be used to validate hardware and techniques for a much larger planned experiment. Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Mini-railgun plasma accelerators will be useful for commercial fusion power, refueling magneti\u00adcally confined plasmas, high specific impulse thrusters for space propulsion, laboratory simulation of astrophysical jets, fast pulsed power switching, materials processing, and high-energy-density plasma research",

        "abstract": "A new high-performance anti-wear coating is being developed under an SBIR program with the Air Force Research Laboratorys Materials Directorate for the Joint Strike Fighter. This coating is based on the Micro-Plasma Oxidation process, which is a high-voltage electrochemical process of oxidation which creates micro discharges on the surface of the part immersed in an electrolyte. This results in the creation of a nanostructured ceramic coating of a dense, ductile oxide layer. The oxide layer improves mechanical, wear, thermal, dielectric and corrosion properties of the surface. Test results under the Phase I SBIR program have shown a 10X improvement in wear life over the baseline. IBC Materials will apply the Micro-Plasma Oxidation process to repair worn-out missile launcher rails in combination with Friction Stir Weld and Cold Spray build-up processes to restore the missile rails to specified dimensions. IBC will also adapt and optimize a wear-protective coating based on the Micro-Plasma Oxidation process to improve the wear life of the rail. A localized coating fixture will be developed to allow coating of the missile rail outside of the bath and to avoid the need to mask the part.  BENEFIT: The forward hanger and missile rail for the AIM-9X missile system are currently experiencing a large amount of fretting and galling wear due to excess vibration & play of the system. As a result several hundred missile rail units are scrapped each year due to excessive wear, costing the Air Force millions of dollars in parts and labor. A repair method to build the materials back to specified dimensions, as well as an improved protective coating, will restore the rails to full service life and possibly extend the life of the missile rails. This will result in a large labor and cost savings for the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy AIM-9X programs. These repair methods can also be applied to other DoD missile systems, as well as gearboxes, landing gear, pumps, and hydraulic equipment.",

The assay uses MTB and Mycobacterium genus (M-Genus) specific probes labeled with different fluorescent dyes. The assay is simple, rapid and in-expensive (lt  5.00/test and a one time expense of ~ 1200 for filters). The assay consists of six steps - Smear preparation and fixation, pretreatment, hybridization, and washing, counterstaining and viewing the processed smear under a fluorescent microscope. MTB and Mycobacterium shall fluoresce with different colors under specific dual pass filters. The total assay time is about 2 hours. Specific Aims: Develop a simple, rapid and in-expensive TB-FISH test kit for culture confirmation and direct detection of MTB in sputum samples. The kit shall contain all the reagents and control smears. Tuberculosis is the disease of the poor. Over one-third of the world's population (mostly in Africa and Asia) is at risk. The only means of identification of MTB is by microscopic examination of acid-fast stained smears. Unfortunately the acid-fast smear lacks both sensitivity and specificity. We demonstrated in Phase I that the MTB-FISH assay sensitivity in pure culture is between 1000 to 10,000 cells/ml for all the MTB complex bacteria. Based on a clinical study performed on over 100 patient smears, the assay sensitivity was better than acid-fast stained smears. As compared to culture, the FISH assay sensitivity in smear positive samples is gt95% and between 40-67% in smear negative samples, with overall sensitivity gt 80%, The acid-fast smear sensitivity is around 60%. As compared to culture, the MTB assay has 100% specificity in cultures and sputum. Based on the Phase I studies, the FISH assay may provide the specificity equivalent to amplified DNA probe assays, and sensitivity better than acid-fast smears. In the industrialized nations, this test may be useful for individuals with pulmonary tuberculosis since they are highly infectious and require immediate isolation and initiation of antituberculosis therapy. Specific Aims for Phase II (1) Purchase microscopes and filters for Clinical Sites and MTb manufacturing department (2) Manufacture TB-FISH Kits and determine shelf-life of reagents. (3) Evaluate Analytical Performance - Sensitivity and Specificity (4) Perform Interference Study - Endogenous and Exogenous (5) Evaluate Assay Reproducibility (6) Evaluate Clinical Performance of the TB-FISH Assays at 4-6 sites. (7) Develop inexpensive Microscope for FISH assays. Proceeding to Phase III will be based on completing the clinical trials and demonstrating specificity of at least 95% and sensitivity equivalent to or better than acid-fast stained smear as compared to culture. Specific Aims for Phase III (1) Filing PMA. (2) Marketing. (3) Work with WHOM to obtain their stamp of approval. This will avoid long delays in approval of the tests in many countries. (4) Develop M. avium complex FISH assay for detecting and differentiating MAI complex from other mycobacteria on a SINGLE smear. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Culture is the gold standard. Unfortunately it can take anywhere from one week to 2 months. Amplified assays have reduced the time to detection and confirmation to less than 2 days. They are especially useful in individuals with pulmonary tuberculosis, since they are highly infectious and require immediate isolation and initiation of antituberculosis therapy. Most of the TB endemic world is also resource poor countries. Because of the cost of the amplified assays, they are of little or no use in the TB endemic world. Some don't even have culturing facilities. The only means of diagnosis is based on acid-fast staining of direct sputum smears that lacks sensitivity and specificity. Therefore, a test like TB-FISH assay with the following attributes would be very useful. 1. Can be performed directly on unprocessed sputum at room temperature. 2. Has specificity of amplified assays and sensitivity superior to direct acid-fast staining. 3. Does not require expensive equipment other than a microscope. 4. Cost less than lt 5.00 5. From time of receipt of sputum sample to result is less than 2 hours. Based on the feasibility study performed in Phase I, we would like get a FDA approval for the TB-FISH assay. Therefore, in Phase II we shall perform all the studies required by FDA for a PMA filing.",

Our goal is to support more informed decision-making about purchasing and incorporating assistive technology [AT] into care settings. The prototype version of the website www.TechforLTC.org was created/enhanced during Phase I. The prototype version focuses on seven care issues: wander management, fall management, assistance call systems, incontinence, bathing, transfer devices, medication management. Phase II of the SBIR project will revise and expand the content of the site, then assess the efficacy of the website as a valuable resource for care providers and designers of long-term care settings. Specifically, Phase II will 1) add additional functionality identified as desirable by Phase I participants 2) add additional content in the form of 6 new Care Issues and expanded resource information and 3) conduct efficacy evaluations to determine if the site is useful and helps consumers make more informed assistive technology purchasing decisions. This methodology follows an Iterative design process which seeks to progressively refine the design of website through evaluation from the early to later stages of the design process. www.TechforLTC.org will be evaluated multiple times by over 300 users, comprised of long-term care providers, architects, and manufacturers. The primary goal of this project is helping long-term care providers maximize their efficiency and accuracy in making decisions about the purchase and implementation of new technologies. The variety of pressures on long-term care providers to  do more with less , combined with the lack of any existing resources that are designed to educate long-term care consumers about making informed assistive technology decisions and our intent to make this website both available at no cost to consumers and self-funding for long-term sustainability, make it a worthwhile project. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Nearly all persons in residential long-term care settings have multiple physical and/or cognitive limitations that result in significant disability; thus technologies targeted at residential long-term care can potentially reach large numbers of older people with the greatest needs. Existing resources for assistive technologies overwhelmingly focus on children and adults living in the community. The current and projected shortage of long-term care workers makes the availability of comprehensive, unbiased, easily accessible information about products and devices that improve efficiency and enhance quality of life critically important.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ineffectual communication with people with dementia is a significant problem in long-term care settings that negatively impacts residents' functional abilities and quality of life. It also influences staff stress and burden which can result in higher turnover and poorer quality care. The environment is a key factor affecting the quality of communication, especially for individuals with impaired communication skills as a result of dementia. A poorly designed communication environment has negative consequences for many groups: residents with dementia, direct care staff and nurses, therapists, family members, and facility administrators/owners. The Communication Toolkit will be the only comprehensive resource that provides information to speech-language pathologists (SLPs), occupational therapists (OTs), physical therapist (PTs), nursing staff, and administration about how to assess and modify the long term care environment so that it is supports the communication skills of people with dementia and improves their quality of life. The specific aims of this SBIR project are: 1) To expand the Communication Toolkit by incorporating additional areas of the residential care environment such as the dining room and activity spaces. 2) To refine and revise the Communication Toolkit per results of Phase I and thorough evaluation by the Advisory Panel. 3) To demonstrate the effectiveness of the Communication Toolkit by measuring positive outcomes in awareness, utility and impact in a larger sample of professionals. This sample will include other professions who work with SLPs to implement communication interventions (e.g. occupational therapists, physical therapists, and nurses). The Communication Toolkit includes the Communication Environment Resource Guide and Assessment Instrument, along with sound and light meters to assess how well the environment supports effective communication. Once expanded and approved by the Advisory Panel, the Communication Toolkit will be evaluated in two waves of data collection, with at least 90 health professionals. The efficacy of the Communication Toolkit will be assessed through the following changes: Awareness of environmental interventions will be assessed by change in knowledge; Utility of information will be assessed by change in behavior; Impact of the Communication Toolkit will be assessed by implementation of interventions; Usability of the Communication Toolkit will be assessed by evaluation of the Communication Toolkit. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Significant proportions of individuals living in long-term care settings experience communication problems, often stemming from dementia, which impairs their ability participate fully in their care and maintain a high quality of life. Although there is solid empirical evidence that appropriate environmental interventions can improve communication, assessment of barriers and facilitators to effective communication is not part of normal clinical practice. The Communication Toolkit will guide health care professions by providing solutions that can be incorporated into functional maintenance plans, restorative plans, caregiver training, and direct treatment interventions, improving the lives of individuals with communication deficits.",

Phase II will focus on technical objectives that will enhance the quality and reliability of the information produced by the ChatterSpike concept researched in Phase I. These objectives fall into three categories: data cleansing, context analysis, and basic commercial readiness. Their achievement will require the design, development and implementation of novel, niche-focused algorithms that will enable the mining and evaluation of thousands of online sources and the production of data with quantifiable quality metrics relating to authority, reliability, influence, and sentiment. The resulting product will algorithmically determine and quantitatively measure and evaluate these parameters in real time as it mines online sources for data, validating its conclusions and re-validating them every time it performs a retrieval operation.  By\nfocusing on specific industry niches, the technology produced will enable the production of automated, highly tailored, detailed reports with a high degree of quantitatively-confirmed reliability. This capability will result from the creation of novel algorithms designed to exploit cutting-edge theoretical approaches to extracting, validating, and evaluating information from a multiplicity of online sources. These reports will be superior to the manual reports produced by currently available technologies and approaches.  In addition, if successful, the technology will have significant societal benefit. Companies will be able to react more quickly to meet consumer demands and to correct negative trends in consumer opinions. The technology will also be able to detect trends reliably at a very early stage; in some cases weeks or months before they become obvious and are detected by other methods.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diseases of the small intestine affect nearly 19 million Americans. Care for these patients has been hindered due to the inability to non-invasively image the small intestine. In the past several years, capsule endoscopy (a pill-shaped wireless swallow-able imager) has revolutionized the non- invasive visual imaging of the small intestine. However it has limitations, including lengthy image review times and poor localization of pathology, which is important for surgical guidance. This has a significant impact on the clinical care of patients. During our Phase I study, Intelligent Image Feature Matching for Small Intestine Capsule Endoscopy, we demonstrated the underlying capabilities necessary to match and spatially index capsule images. Based on these positive results, we now propose to develop a new system for capsule reading that makes strong use of spatial indexing to allow a more effective and intuitive sequencing of capsule images, and image content control as a way of filtering the class of images presented to the user. These capabilities will enhance clinical efficiency while preserving diagnostic sensitivity. They also offer a mechanism to spatially map the small intestine to facilitate lesion localization. We further propose to evaluate the efficacy of this system in a retrospective human study to demonstrate that sensitivity and specificity of detection with our Spatial Navigation System, as compared to existing capsule image browsers, are not substantially reduced, while the time required to diagnose patients is decreased. This reduction in review time with little or no reduction in diagnostic yield, plus an increased ability to localize lesions for surgical treatment, will produce a substantial reduction of the total costs for capsule endoscopy procedures while improving patient care. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Capsule endoscopy for the first time has enabled non-invasive visual imaging of the distal small intestinal mucosa. However, it is hindered by time-consuming manual reviews and an inability to localize lesions. Our proposed software technology will provide gastroenterologists with a quick and efficient tool to review capsule endoscopy data.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The identification of apoptotic events has important applications for detecting cell death induced by disease, injury, therapeutics, or normal tissue development and differentiation. Activation of the intracellular caspase cascade is a well understood mechanism that results in apoptosis. Further advances in medical research increasingly call for in vivo methods and probes for detection and imaging of intracellular signaling events such as the induction of caspases. Immunochemistry Technologies, LLC (ICT) has made fluorochromeconjugated caspase inhibitors for detecting caspase activity in vivo (FLIVOTM) that are modified with a fluoromethyl ketone (FMK). The FMK modification creates an irreversible binding inhibitor. However, the perceived potential for generating toxic fluoroacetates makes these FMK probes undesirable for some investigators: Therefore, Phase I of this SBIR proposes to replace the FMK moiety with a 2,6-difluorophenoxy (OPH) group to eliminate this concern. The newly synthesized OPH-modified fluorescent probes will be compared with the existent FMK-modified probes for their ability to specifically detect caspase activity in vitro and for their suitability as potential in vivo apoptosis detection reagents. Accordingly, the Specific Aims of the Phase I portion of this proposal are: Specific Aim I. Conjugation of FAM-VAD and SR-VAD to OPH and optimization of the conjugation protocol. Specific Aim II. Compare the in vitro detection capability of the OPH-modified probes to the standard FMK-modified probes, and Specific Aim III. Evaluate the potential toxicity of the FMK- and OPH- modified probes. In Phase II of this proposal, the fluorochrome-conjugated FMK- and OPH-modified probes will be evaluated for their comparable ability to detect activated caspases in vivo using five different tumor model systems. The success of ICT in generating these caspase detection probes results in a novel method for in vivo detection of the efficacy of cancer-based therapeutics. The Specific Aims of the Phase II portion of this proposal are: Specific Aim I. Detection of apoptotic tumor cells in mice bearing GL261 gliomas treated with tumor cell lysate and CpG Oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) vaccine. Specific Aim II. Detection of apoptotic tumor cells in mice bearing EMT6 mammary carcinoma treated with tumor cell lysate and CpG ODN vaccine. Specific Aim III. Detection of apoptotic tumor cells in mice bearing LS 174T colon carcinoma and treated with gamma interferon. Specific Aim IV. Detection of apoptotic tumor cells in mice bearing the B16-F10 melanoma and treated with B16a cell vaccine, and Specific Aim V. Detection of apoptotic tumor cells in mice bearing RM-1 prostate carcinoma and treated with RM-1a cell vaccine. Completion of these studies will add two new caspase detection probes to our line of FLIVOTM products. These studies will provide the necessary data for optimizing the dosing and bottling concentration of all of the product probes, as well as a generalized protocol for their use in vivo. Finally, it is hypothesized that these animal studies will provide a foundation for eventual use in human patients.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our primary interest is to develop an imaging method based on bispecific antibody (bsMAb) pretargeting used in combination with F-18 labeled peptides. Such a method would improve the specificity for PET imaging based on the bsMAb's reactivity with either tumor antigens or other markers. This imaging method would take advantage of excellent sensitivity of PET and the high tumor to non-tumor ratios provided by bsMab pretargeting. We have previously described a novel bsMAb pretargeting system based on the hapten binding specificity of an antibody directed to histamine-succinyl-glycine (HSG). Using this system, radiolabeled peptides can be prepared with a variety of radioisotopes for use in imaging and therapy. This pretargeting system has excellent tumor uptake and high tumor/nontumor ratios within 1-3 hours of the peptide injection, and has substantially less renal uptake than directly radiolabeled antibody fragments (e.g., Fab' or scFv). Given the proven success of this pretargeting system, the primary goal of this Phase II application is to examine methods of attaching the most commonly used radionuclide for PET imaging, F-18, to a peptide. The main focus in the first year will be to further develop the novel method of attaching F-18 to a peptide that was disclosed in the Phase I report. Several modifications of the method will be examined with respect to the facile use, yield of product, specific activity, stability and ease of purification. The targeting peptide will carry two HSG haptens to stabilize binding on the tumor cell surface (11). Most of the preclinical work has been done with a bsMab that binds to the colo-rectal tumor marker carcinoembryonic antigen and HSG. The proof of principal for this work will be tested using a bsMAb (TF10) that targets the human pancreatic tumor antigen, MUC1 and HSG. The goal is to help improve the early detection and diagnosis of pancreatic cancer as well as determine the extent of the disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The first goal of this work is to develop a general, simple method of attaching the PET imaging isotope, F-18, to peptides. The second goal of this work is to deliver the F-18 labeled peptide specifically to a tumor while at the same time delivering minimal activity to normal tissues by first administering a novel, genetically engineered, trivalent bispecific antibody that binds specifically to the target tissue of interest (in this case pancreatic cancer), allowing the unbound antibody to clear from the blood (days) and then injecting the F-18 labeled peptide, which contains two groups that bind to the targeted antibody. The injected peptide rapidly localizes to the bispecific antibody on the tumor surface and the portion of the peptide that does not bind to the tumor is rapidly (minutes) cleared from the blood, minimizing uptake in normal tissues thus increasing the contrast between the tumor and normal tissues.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is to develop a standardized and FDA cleared rapid serodiagnostic and confirmatory test for detection of Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi) infections. T. cruzi is transmitted via blood transfusions, is prevalent in Latin America, and is the causative agent for fatal chagas disease. Positive blood donors have been identified, and transmission via the insect vector has been reported in the USA. Current methods to detect infection involve serological screening using whole parasites, or crude lysates and confirmation tests in the USA use a complex radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA). In this application, we have described a number of multi-antigenic fusion recombinant proteins including proprietary ITC6 and ITC8.2. The ITC8.2 has been used extensively in rapid assay formats (Trypanosoma DetectTM). This recombinant contains TcF (currently used in Abbott assay and contains four different repeating epitopes) fused with five additional peptide epitopes and has been employed as the central diagnostic target antigen. All the ITC fusion recombinants were developed during the Phase II tenure of this project and found to be far superior serological marker to the TcF alone. A number of investigations and numerous publications published or in press, confirmed the utility of ITC recombinants as dependable diagnostic targets for T. cruzi infection. In this application we are proposing to continue to develop the ITC based diagnostic assays for chagas disease by manufacturing transfer of assay from RandD to ensure compliance with cGMP and documentation requirements per FDA regulations. Initial discussion with FDA led to development of current protocol for expanded field studies using archived samples in a number of South American countries and Mexico. The data from the field studies will be used for FDA submission and FDA Premarket notification 510(k) clearance. For this purpose we have assembled several sites to perform evaluations. Finally we have developed an alternate to conventional Immunoblot confirmatory assay which is called  Rapid Multi-antigenic Assay (RMA) . The RMA is lateral flow based, uses multiple recombinants and peptides, and does not require extensive washes and accessories. The RMA will be cost effective and therefore will likely to be used by more diagnostic centers and clinics in Latin American countries where Chagas disease is prevalent. In the USA, Trypanosoma Detect will have utility in diagnosis of T. cruzi infections in prospective USA cardiac surgery patients with high risk factors for Chagas' diseases and a confirmatory RMA for use in the USA blood banks. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Thirteen million people are chronically infected with T. cruzi and one-third of those infected will develop debilitating heart and gastrointestinal disease. 200,000 additional infections occur annually. There are a number new treatments are becoming available. Therefore there is a need for sensitive and specific diagnostic test for diagnosis of Chagas disease. In addition, number of cases of Chagas disease incidence in the USA is increasing mainly through blood transfusion from donors of Central America and Mexico origins where Chagas disease is highly endemic. In conclusion rapid diagnostic and confirmatory tests will be highly valuable in Latin America countries and in the USA in a point-of-care situation as well as in blood banks.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to commercialize technology for the inspection of cylinders with reflective surface finishes such as those found in the valve ports of valve bodies and pump covers of automatic transmissions. In order to achieve automated inspection stations with multiple probes in real time, on a production line, and in a factory environment many factors must be addressed such as: protecting the optical, electronic, mechanical and computing system of the probe from the factory environment, ensuring operability and maintainability of the probes on a high speed production line, and integration of the probe software into the computer system of a factory inspection station. Procedures to maximize useful information output must be developed that are easy for plant employees to use and understand. End user requirements for introducing new\nequipment into a production environment must be met including comparing the results of probe measurements with those of existing inspection techniques. The anticipated result will be a prototype valve port inspection system that can be used in a transmission manufacturing plant.  The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be to inspect transmission valve ports for surface defects before the components containing them are assembled into valve bodies and pump covers. At the present time no automated inspection of this kind is being carried out. Valve bodies and pump covers are considered to contain defects only if they fail a leak test after they are assembled. This results in a range of variability in the quality of these components and in the performance and service life of the transmissions containing them. Reducing the variability and improving the quality of automatic transmissions could lead to more efficient vehicles with longer periods between transmission repairs and better fuel economy. It could also lead to a better scientific understanding of the effect of these defects on transmission performance and improvements in the manufacturing process.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuropathic pain (NP) is one of the most common pain conditions seen in clinical practice and is associated with significant physical and psychosocial morbidity. It is estimated that 40 per cent of people referred to pain clinics have NP. However, NP is often not diagnosed or misdiagnosed, so its incidence is likely to be higher. NP alters many aspects of a person's life, affecting physical, social, interpersonal, and emotional well-being. People with NP experience debilitating physical symptoms, and many lose their ability to function at pre-morbid levels in occupational, social, and interpersonal activities, along with significant impairment in mood stability, self-esteem, and experience isolation, helplessness, depression, stress, and anxiety. The financial burdens of NP are in the billions of dollars, and include increased healthcare costs, disability, and lost workdays. While it is widely recognized that a key part of effective pain treatment is engaging the person with pain in self-management, very few resources exist to support this, and those that exist are primarily clinic-based and not widely accessible. Many providers and people in pain remain unaware of the availability of effective behavioral interventions. As such, there is a critical need to develop widely accessible, behaviorally-focused, self-management interventions to meet the needs of people with NP. Interventions based on a cognitive-behavioral model offer excellent utility in meeting those needs, and helping people with NP become active in understanding and managing their pain. The Internet is an excellent vehicle to help people with NP learn pain self-management skills. Inflexxion currently offers a Web-based intervention called painACTION  to help people manage chronic pain due to cancer, migraine and back pain. We propose to develop and test a new component that addresses self-management of NP. The painACTION intervention will provide clinically reliable information about NP in order to motivate and support participant engagement in active pain self-management behaviors. The intervention will provide motivational messaging, tailored feedback, and personalized content recommendations to help people with NP manage and control their pain and pain symptoms, and improve their quality of life. The intervention will focus on teaching practical pain self-management skills, techniques, and strategies that help people play an active role in self-managing their pain. To facilitate the development of a clinically effective and engaging intervention, and differentiate painACTION from the competition, we will employ two innovative technical applications: (1) a custom recommendation engine to identify and deliver highly targeted content to individual users that address user's priorities and problems; and (2) a logic-based development platform to deploy branching logic for tailoring the flow of lesson content and assessment questions to user characteristics, and tailoring assessment feedback to user responses. Because the product will utilize these powerful Web technologies, be based on scientifically validated methods, be developed with input from key stakeholders, and will be subjected to a clinical field trial to demonstrate its effectiveness, we believe that pain ACTION will represent a significant advance in NP care. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Neuropathic pain (NP) is a common pain condition affecting millions of people and dramatically affects physical, social, and emotional well-being. Inflexxion offers a Web-based intervention to help people manage cancer, migraine and back pain, and is proposing to develop and test a new component support self-management of NP.

        "abstract": "Our OASIS tool will support government agencies and potential investors, developers, and operators by providing a sophisticated and comprehensive management tool and by applying advanced system engineering techniques to offshore aquaculture development in the United States. The major near-term impediments to offshore aquaculture development are centered, first, on the regulatory bottleneck driven primarily by environmental and health concerns, and, second, on the lack of definitive economic information on the farms and industry that might eventually develop. The OASIS Model can be used to make effective decisions to resolve the potential conflict between the development of a robust offshore aquaculture industry and the concerns about associated environmental and socio-economic impacts. It will enable multiple levels of analysis ranging from individual farm design to industry-level implications. By incorporating a sophisticated optimization procedure to determine the most efficient development strategies, application of the tool will make farmed fish products more competitive in the marketplace, both in the U.S. and abroad. We believe that this model along with our system engineering methodology represent a powerful approach to aquaculture development and can be adapted to the design and analysis of a wide variety of offshore aquaculture ventures in the United States. If this SBIR project provides information and technology that accelerates the permitting of U.S. offshore aquaculture farms in any reasonable way, the potential payoff is huge as evidenced by the estimated size of the current industry, more than $1B. Offshore aquaculture offers the primary hope for helping to alleviate the U.S. seafood trade deficit, estimated at about $8 billion, which is second only to oil.",

The project will  focus on the  design, development, and testing of the usability, feasibility, and implementation of the Virtual Astronaut Learning Platform (VALP), an immersive, problem-based video game approach to improving STEM learning outcomes. The three-part model will combine the latest in learning sciences research and design with the best in commercial game play, and includes a new serious game-learning methodology - Mission Based Learning; a new game genre, First Person Explorer; and an approach - STEaM, which integrates creativity into STEM activities. The research will include iterative design and rapid prototype testing in school settings during Year 1 and a full-scale quasi-experimental design field test in Year 2. Additionally, the research will examine learning gains related to STEM concepts and problem solving approaches, changes in attitudes towards STEM-related careers, and changes in student self-efficacy related to science inquiry and technology; and will help to advance knowledge related to effective educational game design and implementation.  The Virtual Astronaut Learning Platform will result in a commercial quality 3D game environment that supports single player and collaborative multi-player\nlearning activities. VALP is a collection of game-based STEM learning environments that will be sold as a supplement to existing curriculum and textbooks, thus enhancing the availability of engaging and effective STEM learning activities for students. VALP learning activities are being mapped to national STEM standards and will include a teacher's guide to ensure appropriate integration into the larger STEM curriculum. Set 50 years in the future and based on realistic future science and technology capabilities, VALP will enable students to see how space will be explored in their lifetime, and how STEM content provides them with the knowledge and tools they need to solve real problems in space. Findings from the design process as well as from the learning outcomes research will add to the growing body of research related to effective embedded scaffolding techniques, problem-based learning approaches, and STEM learning and game-based learning approaches for diverse populations.",

In Phase I, a limited functionality prototype tool was developed to demonstrate the feasibility of enabling interactive peer-to-peer scientific communication in the digital library setting.  Phase I also included a comprehensive survey of available commercial technologies to determine whether any commercial-off-the-shelf products could support the peer-to-peer communications that are anticipated.  In Phase II, this survey information will be synthesized in order to develop and refine the final requirements for the enhanced prototype.  An enhanced system design \u00bf including a plan for the configuration, development, integration, and testing of a peer-to-peer system \u00bf will be developed. Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The technology should benefit any research institution or information provider that makes a body of scientific information available.

The system must support multiple sensing modalities including acoustic, seismic and IR.  In this Phase II research, we will complete the development of: (a) new sensor-level hardware/software to provide flexible and configurable data sampling and synchronization, and offer adequate on-board processing and storage capabilities for low-level collaborative signal processing and high fidelity data acquisition; (b) network-level solutions that account for network connectivity and sensor/network health and supports various routing strategies and adoption of user-defined optimum sensor collaboration and data fusion applications; and (c) system console that allows the developers to select and upload their application-specific tasks via a user-friendly interface. The user can choose several possible modes of operation to examine various factors such reliability, bandwidth and timeliness of data.    This research will lead to the development and prototyping of a low-cost WSN development-solution using available ZigBee-based COTS hardware.  The effectiveness of the developed system will be demonstrated in a field-testing exercise using 60 acoustic sensor nodes for transient event detection and localization. Additionally, we will demonstrate applicability of the developed system in a surveillance problem using networks of scanning lasers. These completed systems will be transitioned to the U.S. Army.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent advances in high-throughput measurements of critical parameters related to cancer genesis and development have led to a wealth of cancer-related information available in public and private databases. To realize the promise of dramatic advancement in integrative cancer research enabled by this rapidly expanding information, novel informatics tools that allow researchers to efficiently integrate this available data are needed. The main objective of this proposal is to enable enhanced understanding and modeling of cancer processes through the development of the Cancer Biology Data Integration (CBDI) System, a collection of caGrid services and grid client applications capable of integrating data and information from disparate sources. The CBDI System aims to exploit the rich semantic metadata information and the robust data exchange standards established through the Cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid (caBIG) Initiative, enhancing its use through the provision of a coherent ontological view of caBIG semantics, so that data sources can be queried using a standard semantic query language. The CBDI System contains an Ontology View Generator to expose caBIG semantics using the Web Ontology Language (OWL) and a distributed Semantic Query Processor that implements the semCDI query model to execute RDF-based queries using SPARQL against caGrid data services. The CBDI System also enables the integration of local private data collected by investigators and research institutions. An intuitive user interface providing multiple visualization and concept searching abilities is used to build queries and view results. In Phase I of the CBDI project, key algorithms and mechanisms of the CBDI System were developed, including the exposure of ontology views and the conversion of queries from SPARQL into caBIG's common query language. In addition the overall feasibility of the CBDI System was demonstrated with proof-of-concept prototypes of system components. During Phase II, the complete CBDI System will be implemented and tested with caBIG data services at six research institutions, evaluating its use in a variety of real-world operating conditions and functional scenarios. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Cancer Biology Data Integration System is a collection of caBIG-compatible services that formulate a coherent ontological view of caBIG semantics so that ontology-based queries can be performed using the SPARQL query language over distributed caBIG-compatible data services.",

The conversion of bio-oil from non-food-based biomass to hydrogen for fuel cells would allow significant increases in the use of renewable feedstocks for energy production.  This project will develop a non-food-biomass-based power plant with a solid oxide fuel cell for distributed power generation in the range from 3 to 30 kW.  The bio-oil that will be used in the proposed process will be made from agricultural and forestry residuals, such as wood sawdust, through the fast pyrolysis process.  In Phase I, a conceptual system design was developed to demonstrate that an integrated reformer and solid oxide fuel cell system is a commercially viable approach for producing electricity from biomass.  During Phase II a scaled-up prototype system, which uses sawdust-derived pyrolysis oil as the test fuel, will be designed, fabricated, and tested.  Micro-channel components will be used to obtain a highly efficient reforming system that will help achieve an overall system efficiency of 40%.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The integrated power system should provide an opportunity to reduce the burden on the current electrical distribution system through greater availability of localized power generation from renewable sources.  The use of bio-derived fuels in distributed generation applications would reduce the growth in the demand for natural gas and would enhance grid stability.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary The objective of this project is to develop  Prototype and Scale  kinetic image recognition software to score tracking based phenotypes in a broad range of microscopy based central nervous system (CNS) applications. The target software tool can be flexibly taught to score or screen the precise dynamic phenotypes of interest, and scalable, together with the imaging assay platform (e.g. imaging system, reagents, etc.) to provide high throughput scoring. It will provide 1) motion signal decomposition to isolate heterogeneous spatial-temporal patterns; 2) teachable subcellular object detection; 3) teachable subcellular object tracking; 4) comprehensive track characterization; and 5) kinetic data analysis interfaces to support dynamic phenotype discovery and scoring. We propose to expand and commercialize our tracking technologies including teachable tracking state based tracking, motion energy tracking enhancement and track classification. The work product will be incorporated into our flagship product SVCell, and sold through our commercial partners including Nikon Corporation. The hypothesis is that our tracking software can be used for the accurate and robust analysis of a broad range of CNS applications, and scalable for the high throughput scoring of dynamic tracking characteristics with high speed, accuracy and reliability. To test this hypothesis, we set forth the following specific aims: Aim 1: Optimize the teachable tracking module for a broad range of tracking based phenotypes; Aim 2: Optimize and validate the high throughput scoring of tracking based phenotypes; Aim 3: Evaluate the product readiness of the SVCell tracking beta through field tests and scientific collaborations. This project is significant because technologies are needed which can flexibly screen a variety of tracking based, dynamic phenotypes at high throughput to support practical and effective CNS related scientific programs in basic research (e.g. phenotyping) and applied research (e.g. drug discovery). Analysis of these dynamic phenotypes in time-lapse microscopy movies could provide insights into CNS disease formation and enable earlier and more effective interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Project Narrative Time-lapse microscopy image recognition can make a significant impact on the fight against neurological diseases and mental illness. By quantifying complex, dynamic phenotypes in the movies, it gives scientists a powerful tool with which to discover the basic mechanisms underlying important CNS functions, and then screen methods that act on them. This could enable earlier and more effective therapeutic interventions.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): TP53 is a transcription factor that exerts tumor suppressor function by regulating the cell cycle, DNA repair and apoptosis. Its transcriptionally active form is a homotetramer consisting of four identical monomeric units. Somatic mutations in the p53 gene are found in over 50% of human cancers and germ line mutations in p53 are responsible for an inherited cancer predisposition, Li-Fraumeni syndrome. In addition, for those cancer cells that lack a p53 mutation, up to 80% exhibit a 5-10-fold reduction of p53 protein levels compared to corresponding normal tissues. It has been proven that by supplement p53 protein in these p53-difficient cancer cells to their normal level, the cells will undergo apoptosis and tumors can be controlled or eliminated. Our innovative approach involves the development of a p53 fusion protein therapeutic using our unique, patented refolding technology, Pt-Fold, in conjunction with an efficient, specific, peptide-based delivery technology. During the SBIR Phase I funding period, we have refolded the wild-type, full-length p53 as well as a fusion protein, gonadotropin-releasing hormone-p53 (GnRH-p53), in a stable tetrameric form, from E. coli inclusion bodies. In addition, we have demonstrated a proof of the concept that GnRH-p53 binds to GnRH receptors on the cell surface, enters the cell nuclear, and inhibits the growth of cancer cells in vitro. In preliminary animal studies using rodent tumor models, our university collaborator demonstrated that the GnRH-p53 tested was capable of dramatically slowing tumor growth when compared to controls. In the Phase II project, we will further develop the GnRH-p53 therapeutic into various preclinical dosage forms for therapeutic application. The long term objective of this study is to develop GnRH-p53 into an effective antineoplastic drug to treat patients with breast, ovarian, and prostate cancers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project is to develop new process for efficiently producing GnRH-p53 protein therapeutic for scale-up production and formulation development. The ultimate goal is to develop GnRH-p53 into an effective antineoplastic drug to treat patients with breast, ovarian, and prostate cancers.",

        "abstract": "Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSV) costs the swine industry approximately $560M annually through reproductive loss in mature females and respiratory disease in growing pigs. There is a need for new vaccines for PRRSV to battle the strain evolution and heterogeneity of this RNA virus. Currently the only available US commercial product is a Modified Live Virus (MLV) from BI-Vetmedica. Use of a MLV PRRSV vaccine poses the risks of reversion to virulence and recombination with field viruses and thus is not compatible with an eradication program. Traditional killed autogenous vaccines for PRRSV are also available but are slow to produce / prepare (up to 3 months) and because they contain the whole virus they are not compatible with differential diagnostic tests. In a recent meeting at the University of Illinois attended by renowed scientists and chaired/organized by Dan Rock a white paper was produced which concluded that MLV and inactivated whole virus vaccines were not efficaciouis under field conditions. Unfortunately, Live Virulent Virus Inoculation (LVI) has been thought of as a last resort which leads to dramatic losses of animals and profits of an affected farm. As a result a number of requirements were presented in the white paper for the identification of an effective vaccine; 1 ? Rapid induction of immunity 2 ? Cross-protection against most currently prevalent strains 3 ? No adverse outcomes to swine health 4 ? DIVA (Differentiate Infected from Vaccinated Animals) 5 ? Simplicity of administration to ensure compliance. Based on these set criteria we believe that PRRS-RP technology not only has a potential significant advantage over traditional vaccines but also meets each of these requirements as a new effective PRRS vaccine. The objective of the proposal is to show the PRRS-RP vaccine candidate is not only able to significantly reduce viremia but is safe and efficacious. We aim to accomplish this by; determining if vaccinated pigs shed PRRS-RP and if so do non-vaccinated co-mingled pigs become infected. In response to this data we will determine if a non-target species is capable of shedding the PRRS-RP and if so can it infect other comingled animals. To aid in potency testing we aim to build on the current potency assay (IFA based) by developing a qPCR assay to quantify genome number (total particles / total genomes) giving a reproducible measure of complete PRRS-RP per dose hence aid in the determination of an effective dose. To determine the PRRS-RP product safety profile a study will be performed. These studies will position Harrisvaccines, Inc. to effectively pursue a USDA licensed product, to combat and alleviate the effects of PRRSV on the swine industry. In addition, this newly licensed product will not induce antibodies currently detected in the standard ELISA diagnostic test for PRRSV (DIVA) which will be essential in a national eradiction program, as endorsed by the AASV and producers.",

Resultant needle phobia decreases parents' compliance with immunizations and affects patients' subsequent interactions with health care systems, resulting in delayed diagnoses, refusal to donate blood, and even death. Current products rely on health care professionals to voluntarily use messy, ineffective, and time-consuming interventions for a pain many consider insignificant. An immediately effective reusable pain relief device available directly to consumers could reduce morbidity and suffering worldwide. The market for rapid venipuncture pain relief is large; the market for immediate immunization relief is larger and untapped. A small non-invasive device placed centimeters proximal to the needle site significantly reduced venipuncture pain in adults without impacting IV start success. Phase I of this project evaluates pain and anxiety relief, ease of use, and product acceptance using the device versus standard care in 60 children ages 4 - 6 receiving school-entry immunizations. Concurrently, the prototype will be enhanced to promote pediatric pain relief with distracting cute designs. Phase II of the project is a three arm, placebo-controlled trial to demonstrate pain reduction in four age groups receiving scheduled vaccinations: 4-6 months (n=120), 12-15 months (n=60), 4-6 years (n=60), and 11-12 years (n=75). Using a variety of age-appropriate measures, pain relief will be assessed by videotape coding by blinded researchers, and by parent, nurse, and child self-report when appropriate. Patients will be randomized to one of three groups: placebo, standard care, and using the device. Further professional design will incorporate microelectronic enhancement, internal cooling components, the option to grab and bunch skin for self-injection, durability testing, and power efficiency improvement. Copious literature alludes to the impact of pediatric needle pain and the lack of a good solution. The proposed device overcomes failings in existing products and is easy for consumers to bring to the doctor and apply themselves. These projects will improve and demonstrate the efficacy of a much-needed intervention for pain inflicted on every child.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II (SBIR) project will develop a microfabricated subwavelength antireflective structure (SWARS) for use with a MEMS infrared detector to form and infrared camera. The SWARS structure was prototyped in Phase I and shown to allow greater than 90% of incident radiation in the 8-12 \u00fd\u00fdm portion of the IR spectrum to pass, thus performing better than standard antireflective (AR) multilayer coatings which presently perform this function. These AR coatings are notoriously unreliable, as the thick films tend to delaminate during the processing and packaging of the IR device. In this Phase II project, the SWARS devices will be mated with a thermal light valve (TLV) to make the IR camera.  If successful the proposed approach may be used to produce MEMS devices for a broad range of IR applications, including gas sensors, IR beacons and IR thermographers. Because of their superior transmission properties and the robustness of the design to temperature fluctuations SWARS structures will be used in devices which must operate over a wide range of temperatures, and withstand virtually any operating or processing temperature. Such applications include equipment for factory floor inspections, power grid monitoring, maritime navigation, and security monitoring, in addition to fire fighting and first response.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This SBIR project is designed to develop thermo-responsive nanofibers as microcarriers for cell culture. Nanofiber surfaces provide a more in vivo like growth surface for mammalian cell growth and function. The use of thermo-responsive polymer allows the cells to be released from the substrate in a gentle, non-invasive, and less cumbersome fashion compared to trypsin or other digestive enzymes. This method of cell detachment eliminates the use of animal products in the cell culture process, which is a major cause of concern for pharmaceutical manufacturing processes. This Phase II project describes the synthesis and fabrication of microcarriers from nanofibrillar and thermo-responsive materials for the large scale cultivation of anchorage dependent animal cells. Furthermore, a magnetic thermo-responsive microcarrier is also described to aid in the separation of cells from the culture system. This phase II project is expected to make the use of microcarrier culture more efficient for large scale production of vaccines, recombinant proteins, and cells for therapy, etc. Specific aims of this Phase II proposal include: 1) Fabricate thermo-responsive nanofibers into microcarrier discs; 2) Optimize the use of thermo-responsive microcarriers for cell culture by evaluating growth of three different cell types; 3) Compare and evaluate the efficiency of thermo-responsive microcarrier versus widely used commercially available microcarriers; 4) Synthesize magnetic microcarriers and optimize their use in cell and microcarrier suspension separation.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Basic research and industrial biopharmaceutical production processes using animal cells have a number of safety and technical requirements, such as defined media devoid of substances from animal origins, standardization, high product yield, high product concentration, scale-up potential, etc. Microcarrier based processes fulfill a number of these requirements. In microcarrier culture, cells grow either on the surface of small spheres or as multilayers in the pores of porous structures that are usually suspended in culture medium by gentle stirring. Microcarriers offer a much higher surface area to volume ratio and therefore they have been used extensively for amplifying various types of adherent cells for the expansion of cells for large scale production of growth factors, vaccines, and antibodies. The use of microcarriers is also gaining acceptance in the stem cell research for generating large quantities of cells for cell therapy applications. Cell culture industry is now a significant foundation of the  30 billion annual biopharmaceutical market. As the use of vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, thrombolytics, interferons, blood factors, recombinant proteins and therapeutic enzymes increases, the size of the market that uses mammalian cell culture as the primary method of producing these biopharmaceuticals will also grow.",

        "abstract": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).  This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to create the first on-line social studying platform that allows students to connect, share and learn together. The application is focused on high school and college students. The proposed platform, called OpenStudy, combines both theory and practice in a seamless user-friendly environment that empowers the individual user to learn, create and share their knowledge. OpenStudy will make education accessible, by connecting students of varying levels of expertise, age, location, and social graph; and fun, by providing a social learning experience with peer-to-peer sharing and validation.  In the face of globalization and Thomas Friedman's 'flat earth' economy, competing through education is a fundamental need whose importance is being recognized at a national level. Students and educators alike recognize the need for innovative technologies in addressing this problem. Yet according to leading market analysts, the e-learning supply chain is rooted in old business practices and unable to\nmeet the needs of the new buyers. 'The State of Our Nation's Youth' survey reports that high school students feel the pressure to compete with better grades. Despite the rapid adoption of learning management systems by institutions and of social networks by individual students, there is no systematic solution to this problem nor an application in the education field. Significant technical and business innovation is required to introduce a solution to this problem. The OpenStudy platform seeks to accomplish this change by creating a peer-to-peer learning community to provide a social learning experience for its members. Leveraging the wisdom of a community, OpenStudy will enable students, faculty and alumni to engage in a national conversation focused on learning.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is focused on commercializing a proprietary medical device to provide safe and accurate delivery of epidural anesthesia. Epidural anesthesia provides excellent pain control for childbirth, major surgery, and chronic back pain without having to expose patients to the risks of general anesthesia.  Epidural anesthesia involves (1) accessing the epidural space, a miniscule potential space adjacent to the dura, the thin protective covering of the spinal cord, then (2) delivering local anesthetic to bathe the spinal nerve roots and block pain sensation.  Currently, epidural access requires blind insertion of a sharp-tipped needle through the back that is immediately halted just prior to entering the dura.  The difficulty of the current method poses risks of anesthetic delivery to incorrect anatomic locations and injury to nearby critical structures.  Complications are estimated to occur in 6-25% of cases. InSite Medical Technologies has developed a technology that eliminates the sharp needle tip and provides highly controlled access to the epidural space by uniquely engaging surrounding tissue. During the Phase II project InSite will finalize product design, establish a quality manufacturing system, attain an FDA 510(k) approval and achieve the first human use of the device.  The epidural anesthesia market comprises an estimated 9.8 millions eligible patients each year in the United States of which only 3.4 million patients actually receive epidural anesthesia.  The underutilization of epidural anesthesia results from several barriers including procedure difficulty and physician fear of\ncomplications.  The epidural anesthesia market is segmented into obstetric, surgical, and chronic pain applications.  With over 4 million births annually in the United States, obstetrics is the largest segment.  Currently, during childbirth, 2.4 million women (60%) receive epidural anesthesia for pain control.  The second largest segment is surgical anesthesia where, despite known patient-outcome benefits, epidural anesthesia is used in only 500,000 of 1.8 million eligible cases.  Finally, spine-related pain syndromes are treated increasingly with epidural steroids and implanted stimulators, accounting for 600,000 annual cases.  Outside the U.S., 19 million epidural access procedures are performed annually with a massive potential international market including 130 million births per year.  By creating a safer and more accurate system for delivering epidural anesthesia, InSite Medical Technologies sees an opportunity to produce a premium medical device that positively impacts patients' experience with epidural anesthesia.",

        "abstract": "The Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay Underground Detector for the determination of the neutrino mass has been identified by DOE as a high scientific priority.  Unfortunately, the current generation of proposed experiments would require 500 kg of isotopically enriched germanium (Ge).  The cost of this specialized Ge would exceed $100 million.  150Nd is an alternate parent isotope for neutrinoless double beta decay, which could substantially reduce the size and cost of cooling and detection infrastructure.  However, the favorable theoretical decay rate of 150Nd can be exploited only by using a detector with high detection efficiency and excellent energy resolution.  The only known approach for constructing such a detector is to construct a bolometer of a single crystal from a compound that contains a significant fraction of neodymium.  Therefore, this project will develop technology for growing bulk crystals of a high-purity single-crystal neodymium-containing oxide optimized for bolometer applications.  In Phase I, neodymium gallate was identified theoretically as the preferred compound for this application, and small cubes were fabricated for initial bolometer testing.  In Phase II, the growth conditions identified in Phase I will be realized and scaled-up to produce high-yield optimum-size crystals, and cubes will be delivered for a prototype bolometer. Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The primary application of single crystal neodymium-containing oxides would be for cryogenic bolometers for neutrinoless double beta decay.  The value of the scientific goal of determining neutrino mass is inestimable.  Neodymium gallate also should find use as a substrate for high temperature superconductors.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Food bolus ingestion and foreign body impaction occur frequently and are serious threats to human health. In the United States alone, approximately 1,500 people die each year after swallowing foreign bodies, with children accounting for about 80% of foreign body ingestions. Other groups at increased risk include prisoners, psychiatric patients, and the elderly, especially those who have decreased cognitive function, impaired swallowing after a stroke, or poorly fitting dentures. Rigid and flexible endoscopy, with accessories such as various forceps and snares, is the most common technique for removing these impacted esophageal foreign bodies. Lack of reliability and flexibility of grasping tools, however, make the procedure time-consuming and risky. Often bolus and foreign body removal procedures lead to more invasive surgical procedures and even death, an especially tragic result for a child who has swallowed a coin or battery, the most common event in pediatric cases of obstruction. It is also the most difficult scenario because the contracted esophagus holds the object with substantial force. Power needs to be applied to the prongs of the forceps to overcome these forces; no current technology provides this force. Lack of a secure hold on the object as it is being removed and as the esophagus relaxes often causes the object to go into the trachea, resulting in death. Therefore, physicians involved in these procedures need a tool that can mimic human fingers, which provide maximum articulation. To address these needs, Intelligent Optical Systems (IOS) proposes to develop a new device for ingested foreign body removal, specifically focusing on the withdrawal of the most difficult and least successful procedures, such as coins and button batteries. Based on the highly successful Phase I results of IOS' Artificial Hand (AH), Phase II research will focus on developing, engineering, and testing a novel endoscope with unique distal end tips attachments that will secure the object, allowing its complete and safe removal from the patient. One attachment, the AH's Seeing Fingers, will use a pair of strong pneumatically controlled fingers that will deliver and secure a net around the object. Another attachment, the AH's Seeing Grabber, will use 2 two- or three-finger hands, and will provide distraction and removal of bolus. All Seeing Fingers and Seeing Grabber fingers will have autonomous illumination and visualization channels. IOS will develop the AH's Seeing Fingers and Seeing Grabber in stages. The MEMS microfabrication lab at University of California, Los Angeles, IOS's collaborator, will help to develop the fingers; the optical channels and controls will be developed at IOS. After completion of this step, IOS will assemble the distal manipulating parts, generate the manipulation protocol, evaluate the procedure, and make improvements in the benchtop experiments. The Seeing Grabber prototype will then be fabricated and tested. Finally, the Seeing Fingers will be designed, fabricated, tested, and presented to a potential strategic partner. IOS' proposed Seeing Fingers and Seeing Grabber system will be a vast improvement over existing tools, providing a life-saving tool for physicians. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ingestion of foreign bodies is a common problem worldwide, especially in the pediatric population, where more than 100,000 cases occur each year. The endoscopic technique, currently the gold standard for removing ingested foreign bodies, is inefficient and unsafe, often resulting in death. A safer device, IOS' Artificial Hand's Seeing Fingers, employs two hands with fingers and secures the trapped object, allowing safer removal than is currently available and saving many lives.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad, long-term objective of this program is to improve the knowledge and awareness of patients with critical illnesses, empowering them to more actively participate in meaningful conversations with health care providers and in the decisions that must be made to remedy their current problem and improve their overall health. The specific aim of this Phase II project is to field test and refine a virtual dialogue prostate cancer patient education model involving a multidisciplinary team of experts. This unique patient education model will be accessible over the Internet. When this work is complete, patients and their families will be able to obtain accurate, reliable, comprehensive knowledge about this disease and current treatment modalities through independent virtual conversations with each of the prostate cancer experts. This project is in full support of the NIH mission of improving the health of the nation. If virtual dialogue technology were fully implemented as a unique patient education paradigm over the Internet, it could elevate the understanding patients have about health matters, and empower them with knowledge and the confidence to participate, with their health care provider, in decisions about their illness and general health. Also, this project is in full support of a primary aspect of the NCI mission regarding research in health information dissemination. Virtual dialogue technology offers the opportunity for patients to individually engage cancer experts in a systematic, reliable, multidisciplinary approach to learning about their illness. The dissemination of prostate cancer information to patients through direct,  face-to-face  dialogues with each practitioner in a multidisciplinary cancer clinic on a nationwide basis is unprecedented. The development and research that would lead to this phenomenon is being proposed. In Phase II, the researchers will partner with the Center for Prostate Disease Research (CPDR) clinical staff at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center (WRAMC). A series of virtual dialogue programs will be developed to embody the comprehensive knowledge of six essential prostate cancer experts from the CPDR multidisciplinary clinic (i.e., surgeon, radiation oncologist, urologic andrologist, etc). The series will be evaluated with regard to the feasibility of delivering this series of virtual dialogue programs over the Internet, and the patients' acceptance of this new method will be measured. Also, a usual-treatment Control group will be employed in a pre-post testing environment to assess the comparative knowledge gained by these newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients and to determine if this virtual dialogue model efficaciously delivers the knowledge of these multidisciplinary prostate cancer experts. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  An Internet-based virtual dialogue patient education model will make the most trustworthy health practitioners available to everyone for individual  face-to-face  dialogues about their area of expertise. Patients will be more knowledgeable about their illnesses because of the reliable, comprehensive information they obtain directly from the mouth of the expert. The researchers believe that virtual dialogue represents a new paradigm in patient education; one in which any patient can independently engage medical experts in one-on-one, face-to-face dialogues. The patient is the active participant in the dialogue, rather than a passive, compliant listener. The key technology objective of this Phase II project is to enhance the Virtual Conversations(R) patient education system to include the ability to distribute virtual dialogue programs over the Internet. Achieving this objective will open the door to quick and easy access to the proposed multidisciplinary, prostate cancer virtual dialogue series by all cancer institutions and prostate cancer patients with access to the Internet.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop a low cost educational Particle Image Velocimetry (ePIV) suite including both hardware and software for fluid science and engineering education at university undergraduate and graduate school levels. The proposed PIV is the state of the art technology in fluid flow research that enables visual and quantitative analysis of the flow field. Industrial/research level PIV system usually costs over $100,000. The high cost and safety considerations - because of the use of high power Class IV lasers - prohibit adaptation of PIV systems in the US higher education system. Current PIV systems typically use two pulse lasers with 50 mJ/pulse energy and 5 nanossecond pulse duration. This translates to a total power of 10 mega Watts if it was a continuous laser. In summary, although it is very challenging to develop a PIV system that works with only a single 15 milliwatt continuous laser and a regular CCD camera,  the Phase I outcomes indicate that it is feasible. The project will create learning materials by developing software as a virtual teaching assistant for the education process, where the students can develop enhanced understanding of fluid flow by interactive experiments through a computer terminal in the classroom. Hence, the software will be an instrument\nthat can be used in diverse educational settings because of its effectiveness as an education tool, high-tech appeal, compact size, low cost and safety.  Fluid mechanics is a highly visual subject. During the teaching process one must take full advantage of this fact. ePIV gives the opportunity to achieve this to its full extent making this technology easily accessible. The educational suite will provide faculty the latest technology as a teaching tool at a very affordable price, allowing them to acquire new knowledge and skills and to revise their curricula and teaching practices. The low cost of ePIV will allow schools with very limited budgets to use and teach the state of the art technology to their students. The project envisions bringing this new technology from technical colleges to BS, MS and Ph.D. granting institutions. Due to its simplicity of operation, low cost and being highly visual, the ePIV technology can even be used at museums, science centers and similar institutions to develop exhibits in science and engineering. This tool can also be used to promote fluid mechanics and science in general even to non-science and non-engineering students.",

The lack of effective p-type TCOs has been a long-standing problem for the electro-optic industry. It is the crucial component to advance photovoltaic technology with n-type absorbers. The Phase I project developed cutting-edge spray pyrolysis technology to deposit wide-gap p-zinc oxide (p-ZnO) films. The project achieved important breakthroughs, both in terms of the new deposition system, as well as achieving p-ZnO films with inexpensive spray pyrolysis. The structural and electro-optical data for the ZnO films validate the feasibility of the new deposition approach and provide a compelling measure of project success. The Phase II project will advance the deposition system, improve the scientific understanding of doping issues, derive process-property correlations to optimize the electro-optical properties, and integrate technology into existing technology.  The broader impact/commercial potential for new optoelectronic products is increasing exponentially, owing to the demand for clean energy and the microelectronics revolution. The deposition method offers cost and manufacturability advantages over current vacuum methods; it is remarkably versatile to deposit a number of other technological semiconductors that are amenable to spray deposition. The p-ZnO films can be used for short-wavelength light-emitting diodes, laser diodes, energy efficient windows, flat panel displays, gas sensors and other opto-electronic applications. It can extend photovoltaic technology to n-type absorbers and multi-junction flexible solar cells for higher efficiency.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this program is to create an implantable stimulator device to restore functional eye blink in patients with unilateral facial nerve paralysis. The system will electrically stimulate the paretic eyelid when EMG electrodes detect normal blink from the contralateral eye to produce a synchronous blink. The implant will consist of a thin, ceramic package placed subcutaneously above the hairline with an EMG electrode pair for detecting contralateral blink and a thin-film stimulating array implanted on the paretic orbicularis oculi muscle (OOM). We have designed this system to include a polyimide flex circuit thin-film stimulation array, which is implanted along the length of the palpebral component of the paretic orbicularis oculi muscle. Multiple stimulation sites will allow clinicians the ability to selectively activate all necessary muscle tissue to evoke spontaneous blink via a diffuse injection of low levels of current across the array. The system will include a pair of EMG recording electrodes implanted into the contralateral intact orbicularis oculi muscle to detect normal reflexive blink. This detected blink single will be relayed to implanted circuitry inserted above the hairline in the scalp, which will trigger stimulation causing a synchronous blink. The device will be powered by a small, external module worn behind the ear, which activates the implanted with a wireless reflected impedance signal and provides a user interface to control stimulation intensity. The implant will be inductively powered from an external system consisting of a battery, stimulation control, and a low frequency RF inductive coil placed near the patient's implant. This external power configuration has the advantages of decreasing the size of the implanted device and increasing the lifetime of the device by avoiding an implanted battery. The market for these devices is relatively small with annual patient populations on the order of a few thousand per year. For these patients, however, the availability of this technology will provide a profound improvement in quality of life and reduction of total care costs due to complications related to exposure of the affected eye. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The implantable blink prosthesis system produced in this program will provide a fundamental improvement in the treatment of facial paralysis. These improvements will apply to both the aesthetic and functional use of the paralyzed eyelid preventing painful ocular ulceration and profound facial disfiguration.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The threat of terrorist attacks using biological weapons continues to be a major national security issue. A new congressional report (www.preventwmd.gov, Dec 3, 2008) indicates that a terrorist attack with bioweapons or other weapons of mass destruction might occur before 2013. Plague and smallpox could be devastating bioweapons if intentionally released. A release of 50 kg of Y. pestis over a city of 5 million people could result in as many as 150,000 clinical cases and 36,000 deaths. At this time, no human vaccines are available for plague and the current smallpox vaccine has significant side effects. Our long-term goal is to develop a highly safe and efficacious poxvirus-based vaccine that provides protection against aerosol exposure to Y. pestis and also against smallpox. As part of a phase 1-funded SBIR, we have optimized expression of Y. pestis antigens in the poxvirus vector, modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) and evaluated the efficacy and safety profile of several recombinant MVA-based plague vaccines. As a result of these studies, we have selected for further development a recombinant MVA virus expressing a novel form of the Y. pestis V antigen (MVA/V). We propose here to manufacture GMP-quality vaccine seeds and conduct preclinical studies required for FDA approval under the Animal Rule (21 CFR, 314.600) and required to initiate human clinical trials. Our specific aims are: 1) develop master seed virus stocks for the MVA/V vaccine virus, 2) optimize the efficacy of MVA/V vaccine in mice, 3) determine the efficacy of a MVA/Vin two non-human primate species, 4) test for any toxicity of the MVA/V vaccine, and 5) develop quality control and release tests for GMP manufacturing of MVA/V. This project involves productive collaborations between a small business (Inviragen), research institutions (University of Wisconsin, Colorado State University), and government agencies (United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, USGS National Wildlife Health Center). Inviragen's extensive experience with the manufacture, preclinical testing and regulatory submissions for recombinant viral vaccines will speed the progress of this needed product from the bench to the clinic. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Plague has caused severe epidemics in many parts of the world, resulting in human deaths and significant economic losses and could be a devastating bioweapon. The release of smallpox is a deadly bioterrorist threat given that much of the population is now unvaccinated. A safe, easily stored and easily administered combination vaccine that simultaneously protects against both plague and smallpox would improve the security and safety of military, first responder personnel and civilian populations worldwide.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    This Phase II project will leverage the favorable results for inXsol's Phase I  eLearning for HAZMAT and Emergency Response  project. In the Phase I project, inXsol undertook research to establish the technical/scientific merit and feasibility for the design and use of an affordable, stand alone simulation-based training tool. This tool supplements instructor guided training for hazardous materials health and safety and can be tailored to meet the local needs of cities and states. The result of this effort is a computer simulation called Command Plan that it runs as a desktop application. For Phase II, inXsol proposes moving the successfully deployed and tested computer-based HAZMAT simulation scenario from a desktop application to a web-based simulation delivery structure. This transition to a web-based application will provide an opportunity to research the technical challenges and feasibility of providing an accessible, low-cost incident command application. The research proposal includes three activities. First, developing a web-based simulation with the Phase I application acting as a development prototype. Next, importing the Phase I HAZMAT scenario to the web-based simulation will be completed. Finally, conducting two evaluation exercises for the web-based HAZMAT scenario using the web-based simulation developed in this Phase II project. The research will compare the results of the web-based learner experience to that of the learner experience and performance of the Phase I exercise. Phoenix Fire Department (Phoenix, Arizona) and Mesa Community College (Mesa, Arizona) will supply subject matter expertise for the project along with targeted audiences selected among skilled support personnel (SSP) awareness, first responder operations, hazardous materials technicians and incident command students.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cryptosporidiosis is a leading cause of diarrheal disease worldwide and is a category B biothreat agent. Two major species, Cryptosporidium hominis and Cryptosporidium parvum are responsible for over ninety percent of cases in man. C. parvum is zoonotic, with a reservoir in cattle, where it is an economically important cause of disease. There is currently no specific drug for cryptosporidiosis. The goal of this project is to bring to the point of readiness for out-licensing Directed BiocideTM therapeutics which target Cryptosporidium species affecting man and livestock and which are effective in oral treatment of cryptosporidiosis. The Directed BiocideTM approach creates a recombinant fusion protein in which an antibody targeting a surface epitope on Cryptosporidium sporozoites delivers an anticryptosporidial biocide comprising a natural antimicrobial peptide or enzyme to the surface of the sporozoite. With this approach Directed BiocideTM products are effective at far lower concentrations than a sporozoite-neutralizing antibody acting alone. Additional Directed BiocidesTM will be developed to target all causal species of human cryptosporidiosis, including C. hominis, and will be tested in vitro and in multiple animal models. Purification strategies will be established for these novel fusion protein products which will be suitable for human use products. The project also continues research to produce anticryptosporidial Directed BiocidesTM in milk of transgenic cattle for oral treatment of livestock or large populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cryptosporidiosis is one of the most important causes of diarrheal disease worldwide, affecting both immunocompromised and immunocompetent individuals and sometimes causing mass outbreaks. Cryptosporidium is a Category B biothreat agent. Currently there is no effective drug available for cryptosporidiosis. This project develops a novel recombinant protein drug to neutralize the two species of Cryptosporidium that are responsible for over 90% of cases affecting humans.",

This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project addresses the low volume manufacturing of test probe cards through Electrochemical Printing.  Integrated Circuit Board Testing Connectors(ICBTCs) include contactors that are metal structures designed to contact integrated circuit boards (ICBs) at the wafer level during production with wafer probe cards (WPCs) or after packaging with package testing sockets (PTSs). WPC contactors are manufactured with semiconductor processes (SPs) in high volume whereas PTS contactors are built in lower volume with conventional microfabrication (CM) or low cost plating through dryfilm masks on flexible substrates. There is increasing pressure to reduce the ICB package size and PTS contactor dimensions while also reducing testing costs. This project addresses these needs by developing a moderate cost, high resolution electrochemical printing technology.  The broader impacts of this research include providing repair solutions for high value products that are currently thrown away and reducing plating bath inventory in an electrodeposition tool by at least 10X.  The long term opportunity is for EcP is to revolutionize desktop microfabrication because it is a low cost, single step process that has promise of producing complex 3D fully functional polymer, semi-conductor, and metal parts.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop a highly sensitive and rapid point-of-care nucleic acid test based on IQuum's lab-in-a-tube (Liat ) platform for the quantification of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV-1) from plasma samples. The Liat HIV Assay will utilize the Liat Analyzer to enable the minimally trained personnel to perform the HIV-1 test at a hospital, clinic or physician's office in less than 1 hour. By enabling effective and sensitive single visit HIV-1 quantitative testing, we expect that the Liat assay will allow clinicians to rapidly change a patient's antiretroviral therapy once a significant change in viral load has been identified. The Liat HIV-1 Assay overcomes the limitations of current HIV-1 tests, whose long turnaround time and technical complexity requires testing to be performed in centralized laboratories, resulting in missed opportunities for rapid therapy changes disease prevention due to turn around times and patient follow-up. In Phase II, we propose to expand the assay developed from Phase I by integrating all assay components, including the internal quantitative controls, into a single Liat tube for multiplex HIV-1 quantification. In addition, a semi-automated manufacturing solution for Liat HIV-1 Assay Tube production will be developed and validated. Finally, the Liat HIV-1 Quantitative Assay will be characterized and validated in analytical and pre-clinical studies. At the conclusion of this phase of the project, we will be prepared to initiate external clinical studies in support of a PMA submittal to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The assay will be among the first point-of-care nucleic acid tests, and will provide significant benefit to public health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: By enabling effective and sensitive single visit HIV-1 quantitative testing, the Liat  HIV-1 Quantitative Assay will allow clinicians to quickly identify treatment failure and provide immediate and effective intervention, thereby significantly improving the quality of life for HIV-1 infected persons.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Establishments that serve alcohol are a vast industry in America, but are unfortunately a common setting for aggressive and violent behaviors that are sometimes associated with alcohol consumption. Many servers (bartenders and wait staff) have limited training, job skills, and work experience. These combined factors put servers and their patrons at risk. Many states have responded by requiring or incentivizing establishments to participate in Responsible Beverage Service (RBS) training. There is, however, considerable variation in quality, cost, duration, intensity, content, and mode of delivery among them. Many fail to use approaches shown to be effective in promoting professional development and effective adult learning, and focus primarily on legal and liability issues, overlooking the importance of teaching basic behavior management skills. Face-to- face RBS training can be expensive, time consuming, and difficult to access; additionally, its cost-effectiveness is limited by the industry's high turnover rate. Servers and their patrons would benefit from accessible, online RBS training grounded in behavioral psychology and informed by principles of adult learning.    The overall goal for this project, Alcohol Servers Applying Psychology (ASAP) Phase II, is to develop a series of online training modules for alcohol servers on how to apply effective behavior management techniques in  drinking establishments. This training will be delivered through a sophisticated yet user-friendly web delivery  platform (IRIS Ed Online) developed by IRIS Media to extend the reach of public health interventions and  disseminate training on a wide scale. The ASAP training program will use engaging and instructionally sound approaches that include observational learning techniques, interactive mastery exercises, self-assessment reviews, journaling exercises, and online social support, and will draw on well-established research on behavior management and alcohol-related violence prevention.  The ASAP program will train servers to: 1) understand the effects of consumption of alcohol and other  drugs on behavior, including intimidation, aggression, and sexual harassment; 2) comprehend the impact of  the physical environment on patron behavior; 3) use proactive management skills to maintain a positive social  environment; 4) apply stress reduction techniques to stay calm when problems arise; 5) recognize and defuse  potential problem situations; and 6) identify emergency situations and follow appropriate procedures.   In Phase I, a key program module (recognizing and defusing potential problem situations), was developed and tested for efficacy. In Phase II we propose to complete the program by developing and evaluating additional modules. Our evaluations will include both formative (focus groups, key informant interviews, and  usability testing) and summative assessments, the latter including a two-panel, randomized, controlled study  with pre-post surveys of knowledge, skills, self-efficacy, behavioral intention, technology acceptance, and  consumer satisfaction, as well as pre-post and follow-up observations in 43 establishments.                  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The consumption and abuse of alcohol in drinking establishments can often lead to aggressive and violent behaviors and put workers and patrons at risk of injury. Alcohol Servers Applying Psychology Phase II will provide online training to alcohol servers in how to use psychologically-sound measures to prevent problems and to intervene when potentially dangerous confrontations arise. Through this program, servers will receive training in a set of tested, positive, and effective strategies.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ADHD is the most common neurobehavioral disorder of childhood and among the most prevalent chronic health conditions affecting school-aged children. The prevalence of ADHD in school-aged children ranges from 4-12 percent. Approximately 3.5 million children meet the criteria for ADHD, yet only about 50 percent of these children are adequately diagnosed and treated. While a lot is known about ADHD, a lot more can be done to effectively put this knowledge into everyday practice. One reason that many ADHD children are not adequately treated is that it can be very challenging to formulate a comprehensive approach to addressing and managing ADHD. The vast majority of efforts involve isolated efforts by school systems, parents, and treatment providers. The importance of facilitating an integrated effort, however, is paramount given that positive outcomes are achieved when interventions involve a systematic appraisal and integration of the child's total environment. The goal of this project is to assess the educational and psycho-social needs of parents, teachers, and ADHD youth and to develop and test a web-based multi-media program designed to meet and integrate these varied needs. The program will be designed for administration to school staff and parents with ADHD children. The program will focus upon providing behavioral techniques and tools that facilitate the development of effective strategies for collaboration between school and home and to promote the implementation of targeted goals for maximizing academic and personal success. In Phase I, needs assessments were conducted with teachers, parents, and middle-school youth. Experts in the fields of developmental and clinical psychology assisted in reviewing the scientific and educational content of the program. Parents and teachers also reviewed the program and commented upon specific dimensions of the content. Parents and teachers evaluated the program on usefulness, applicability and relevance to their needs and all feasibility criteria were met. In Phase II, the program will be fully developed. This will include adding a platform and interface that allows for communication between parents and teachers and the sharing of common goals and strategies. Following development of the full program it will be field-tested on parents and teachers to measure the ability of the program to effectively educate users and facilitate the ability to address issues commonly associated with ADHD. Following testing the program will be prepared for marketing. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is the most common neurobehavioral disorder of childhood and among the most prevalent chronic health conditions affecting school-age children. While much is known about the disorder, gaps exist in finding resources that address an integrated approach to care and effectively promote communication between teachers and parents. The outcome of this SBIR project will be to develop a multi-media web-based program that focuses on behavioral and communications techniques and tools to facilitate home-school collaboration thus creating a mechanism for a child with ADHD to thrive in school and the community.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II proposal seeks to develop an automated sensory system (AMSS) for gathering and processing of mosquitoes vectors of West-Nile-Virus-Fever (WNV). AMSS captures mosquitoes, macerates them with solvents, process the fluid using a sensory array, relays wirelessly the information to a centralized internet hub where data is hosted, managed, reports created and distributed. There are four main parts to the proposed AMSS: 1) Design and development of the robotic device that sucks and crushes the insect; 2) Design and development of the sensor array; 3) Development of methods to determine presence of WNV in the circulatory fluids of the insects; 4) Automated wireless system for transmitting data. The AMSS can also be decoupled from the mosquito-trap providing the user with a handheld-sensing-system to detect WNV in samples derived from vectors (e.g. mosquitoes) or hosts (e.g. humans, vertebrates in general). The proposed system can be potentially expanded for detecting other harmful pathogens and could be used by homeland security and public health agencies.  If successful detection of the WNV-pathogen at a very early stage of its occurrence is of significant benefit to public health agencies and may allow for diversion of future epidemics. Early detection is the only form of early epidemic prevention. This project describes a disruptive concept to fill an enormous gap in vector-management, which now lacks technologies for speedy and effective\ndata collection. WNV-detection-instruments are slow, expensive, bulky, require human interference and laboratory conditions with plenty of consumables and energy, and not amenable to unattended autonomous operation. Current detection procedures invariably fail to detect introduced pathogens before disease or epidemics become widespread. Vector-control personnel and epidemiologists rely on manual time consuming mosquito- vector management methods that often come too late to prevent epidemics and require expensive remedial actions, such as blanket spraying of insecticides on entire regions. Such mosquito management is inefficient, ecologically harmful and conducive to pesticide resistance. The proposed AMSS system will have significant impact in the detection of WNV-pathogens market, evaluated at $500M/yr. This will foster preventative rather than crisis or partially effective, remedial control actions. Implications can be made that this vector and disease management may be useful for bio-detection in the homeland-security, health-care, agroenvironmental field and food-safety markets, evaluated at $1.3B/yr.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Over the last two decades, there has been a growing need to record electrical signals directly from the brain in humans and animals, especially in candidate patients requiring resective epilepsy surgery. At the same time, there is an increasing demand for real-time monitoring of a larger number (gt200 channels) and different types of electrodes and modalities to provide adequate spatial and temporal resolution for pathophysiology; a challenge that becomes self-limiting and intractable with current state of practice. ITN Energy Systems, in collaboration with Yale University Epilepsy Program and Ad-Tech Medical Instruments Corporation will bring their unique expertise in biocompatible materials and sensors, nanoscale electronics, neurosurgery, neuroscience, and manufacturing, marketing and commercialization of brain implantable electrodes to develop an enabling wireless, multi-channel intracranial electroencephalogram (icEEG) implantable system/device. In the Phase I effort, we were able to successfully design and fabricate an implantable icEEG measurement and recording device. Successful operation of the device was validated as a free-standing system and then subsequently implanted in three rodents. The implanted monitoring system measured and recorded icEEG signals over the course of several days, including successful demonstration of remote powering using a radio frequency (RF) inductive link and the wireless transmission of icEEG data with a high bandwidth infrared communications link. The goal of the Phase II project will be to expand the Phase I 5-channel system for rodents into a 64-channel system with continuous icEEG recording (0.1 to 500 Hz at a 1 KS/sec sampling rate) for direct application in humans. In particular, we will 1) Optimize the current inductive RF link (13.56 MHz) and power management circuit design to reduce the footprint of the implant antenna, insure MRI safe operation, and incorporate the option of on-board power storage feature (battery and/or capacitor) for continuous uninterruptible operation, 2) Improve and expand the existing infrared link by developing and implementing software to support an IrDA protocol, 3) Reduce overall footprint by 30% using die level components on a lightweight substrate, 4) Conduct extensive biocompatibility and toxicity testing for short and long term applications, and 5) Conduct thorough rodent tests, using expanded 4 by 8 and/or 8 by 8 electrode grid arrays to optimize performance and robustness of the device. Successful completion of Phase II will validate critical building blocks of a multimodal implantable icEEG system that is inherently expandable to meet the growing needs for hundreds of measurement channels. These advances move the device towards use in patients and subsequent product development and commercialization. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project proposes the design and testing of a wireless, 64-channel implantable system for the continuous recording of icEEG signals from the brain. Such a wireless system will not only eliminate tethering of patients to EEG equipment but expand the number of channels surrounding the seizure onset region in medically intractable epilepsy patients requiring surgery, monitoring of brain trauma, and the understanding of other neurological disorders. The proposed implantable technology will facilitate the direct access of electrical activity within the brain via wireless transmission of a high resolution, digital data stream that links directly into a portable laptop or waste-worn data storage system.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this 2 year long Phase II research project is to develop a 510(k) FDA approved robotic microkeratome device using that will automatically create a large (gt 8 mm) uniform pocket through a small incision (lt 3.5 mm) within a live human cornea. The device uses robotic principles to move a thin blade in 3 different axes which allows the microkeratome to create a substantially round pocket through a small incision. By providing a uniform pocket in a live or donor cornea, corneal transplantation may be performed more safely, quickly, and with better visual outcomes. In addition, the ability to create relatively large corneal pockets through a small incision may provide new and improved methods to implant intracorneal lenses and keratoprostheses. At the present time there is no commercially available device which allows the automatic creation of a uniform pocket in an opaque cornea. Our primary milestone for the Phase II study will be to demonstrate the ability of our FDA approved device to automatically create uniform pockets in live human eyes with corneal blindness and limited visual potential. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We are developing a robotic device which will be able to make a large uniform pocket in the cornea of a live human cornea through a small incision. Corneal transplantation may be performed more safely, quickly, and with better visual outcomes through the use of this device. In addition, the ability to create relatively large corneal pockets through a small incision will provide new and improved methods to implant intracorneal lenses and artificial corneas.",

        "abstract": "Electrostatic precipitators are widely used for removal of particulate matter form boiler exhaust gases.  The EPA promulgation of National emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) from Industrial, Commercial and Institutional Boilers and Process Heater will require industry to install many new high performance precipitators on such sources in the coming years.  The Plasma Discharge (PD) Electrode is an innovative technology intended to replace the conventional corona discharge electrodes in electrostatic precipitators.  With the PD electrode, precipitators for small oil and coal fired boilers could be made significantly more efficient at removing fine particulate matter from their effluent gases.  Phase I research has shown that PD electrodes are capable of increasing the useful electrical power input to a precipitator by 42% and improve uniformity of current distribution by 200%.  This promises to result in a twofold improvement in performance of an existing precipitator and a corresponding reduction in the cost of a new precipitator installation.  Phase I testing also verified that the PD electrode can function in coal fired boiler exhaust gas streams.  The proposed Phase II research will demonstrate this improved performance on a pilot scale precipitator installed at a coal fired power plant.  This will be done by measuring the particulate collection efficiency of a precipitator equipped with conventional electrodes and then measuring the collection efficiency of the same precipitator when fitted with the new PD electrodes.  The commercialization option will result in the retrofit of a full scale precipitator field with PD electrodes.  When completed successfully, these two milestones would be sufficient to bring the technology to commercialization.  It is anticipated that the PD electrode technology will be licensed by Neundorfer Particulate Knowledge, a leading supplier of aftermarket precipitator services in the US.  The design of the PD electrodes lends itself to use with electrostatic precipitators with very little change to their basic design.  If demonstrated at full scale and technically successful, the PD electrode could become standard equipment in electrostatic precipitators installed on small industrial boilers.  The improved performance they afford would decrease particulate emissions to atmosphere and/or decrease the cost of the precipitator installations.  This would represent a significant advancement for particulate control technology.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this project is to develop, formally benchmark and validate a new flow sensor that will accurately quantify varying degrees of ventilation in pediatric and adult patient populations. The flow sensor is a simple, non-contact, disposable part that provides quantitative measurement of respiratory activity, even in the low-flow range. Current technologies lack the ability to accurately measure tidal volume but rather provide a semi-quantitative measure of respiratory patterns. A pneumotachograph (which can provide quantitative data) is too burdensome on patient comfort and breathing effort to obtain long term respiration measurements. Self-funded preliminary prototypes were developed prior to this grant submission and tested at the Johns Hopkins Sleep Disorders Center in Baltimore. The prototypes performed comparable to the gold standard (pneumotachograph). This project will finish development of the design, formally benchmark the flow sensor with the pneumotachograph, as well as examine the stability and accuracy of the design. Following this, the design will undergo planned improvements related to patient comfort and compliance. The project will conclude with formal clinical validation studies at overnight sleep clinics across a spectrum of patients to compare and validate the new flow sensor to current technology. Final design modifications will focus on optimization of a  plug-and-play  interface thereby simplifying integration with existing polysomnographic recording units and improving technician ease of use and patient comfort. The data and prototypes generated by this application will ultimately translate into improved care of patients that are susceptible to ventilatory failure and eventually as an ambulatory diagnostic system for patients in the home setting. This flow sensor will have an immediate impact on patient monitoring in sleep laboratories and will further influence diagnostic procedures in pulmonary medicine, anesthesia and other medical disciplines.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fibrosis can be defined as an uncontrolled wound healing response that results in organ dysfunction. Fibroproliferation leads to the over production and increased deposition of extracellular matrix, particularly collagen, eventually replacing normal tissue with scar tissue. Typically this is a slow process occurring over many years, often resulting in organ failure or death. Fibrosis is a cause of morbidity and mortality in multiple conditions and chronic fibrotic disorders have been estimated to be the cause of over 45% of deaths in the developed world [6]. Currently there are no effective therapies for this large group of fibrotic diseases, representing a major unmet medical need. The slow turnover and chronic nature of these disorders is the main obstacle to evaluating the effectiveness of anti-fibrotic therapies using standard techniques. Collagen is the main extracellular matrix protein that accumulates in fibrosis. KineMed has developed a proprietary technology, using stable isotope labeling and mass spectrometric analysis, to accurately measure changes in tissue collagen synthesis in vivo in humans and animal models. The goal of this research is to apply this technology to the measurement of collagen synthesis in patients with fibrotic disorders and thereby evaluate drug candidates for their effectiveness as anti-fibrotic agents. The specific aims of our Phase I research were to develop and validate a high through-put kinetic method for the simultaneous detection of cell proliferation, mitochondrial biogenesis and fibrogenesis (measured as collagen synthesis rate), for use as readouts of hepatic toxicity. We achieved these goals by developing sensitive assays for liver cell proliferation and collagen synthesis in vivo models of hepato-toxicity. These assays were then validated against conventional methods. Stable isotope detection of cell proliferation and collagen synthesis proved highly sensitive and reproducible in several models of drug and chemical exposure. Our Phase II specific aims are, 1) to use measurements of collagen synthesis rates to identify a lead anti-fibrotic drug from a series of candidates in preclinical animal models of fibrosis; 2) to demonstrate the feasibility of stable isotope labeling to measure collagen synthesis in human skin and liver biopsies; and 3) to determine the effects of fibrotic diseases on the rate of collagen synthesis in patients with active fibrotic disease. The application of this technology to quickly and accurately quantitate disease progression and assess drug efficacy in humans could in principle allow us to identify anti-fibrotic drugs more rapidly and accelerate the clinical processes required to bring these candidates to clinic in a patient population that is currently severely lacking effective therapies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Fibrotic diseases are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality in association with a large number of diseases. The development of effective pharmacological therapeutics for these individuals has been hindered by a number of factors. Firstly, fibrogenesis is a slow process, often taking years to develop, so assessing changes in fibrosis over a small period of time is difficult and makes clinical trials long and expensive. Secondly, the current methods for measuring fibrosis are insensitive and qualitative rather than quantitative. The goal of this work addresses both of these problems. Translating our collagen kinetic biomarker from rodents to humans will give us an assay for the rapid and accurate detection of disease progression in patients. In turn, this will allow us to rapidly evaluate and develop therapeutic agents for this significantly underserved patient population.",

These clinical samples will eventually be evaluated for KX2-391 related biomarkers which will provide tools to monitor the efficacy of the drug and to potentially identify patients who are most likely to benefit from this treatment. In addition, these biomarkers will be helpful in designing Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials, and monitoring their success. The experiments proposed in this grant application are focused on identifying and validating KX2-391 associated biomarkers by first using mouse models for various human cancers such as colon, pancreas, prostate and breast. KX2-391 has been shown to be efficacious in mouse models for these types of cancer and these types of cancer are being considered for Phase 2 clinical trials. Once potential biomarkers are identified in the animal studies, they will be used to analyze human samples. The goal of biomarker research is to identify genes or proteins that can be used to detect disease, monitor progress to a therapy, monitor treatment compliance, determine treatment efficacy, predict response to treatment and to stage disease. These goals are certainly ambitious; however the potential payoff would be tremendous. Funding research to provide these benefits to patients is clearly warranted.

The success of research projects typically requires that such teams, with heterogeneous skills and resources, work together to address the technical challenges.  Thus, collaborative research tools are required to share, visualize, manipulate, annotate, and compute the data.  Furthermore, these tools must be easily deployed and used to facilitate the collaborative experience.  This project will address these requirements by extending the widely-used open-source ParaView system to support large-scale, collaborative data visualization.

A commercial grade clinical scanner has been designed and constructed by Koning Corporation in compliance with international and national standards and regulations. Two pre-production prototypes have been installed at Elizabeth Wende Breast Care, LLC (Rochester, NY) and the Emory University (Atlanta, GA), for clinical trials and studies. The Koning CBCT 1000 system has passed electromagnetic compatiblity and electrical safety testing by a nationally recognized testing lab (Intertek) as required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The novel features of the system are as follows, true isotropic high resolution without breast compression; equivalent or less dose than diagnostic mammography; equivalent or even better breast coverage than mammography; platform for future imaging-guided biopsy and possible dynamic contrast imaging and angiogenesis imaging with slip ring technology. It is anticipated that KBCT will have many technical advantages over mammography, including eliminating lesion overlap and removing superimposed structures (thus greatly simplifying the perception of breast tumors); providing a true 3D description of breast anatomy and lesions; providing accurate measurement of size, volume and density of breast tumors; and providing characterization of the borders, shapes and margins of breast tumors. The specific aims of this project include: building and testing a KBCT image guidance subsystem for biopsy; redesign of the patient table to improve patient comfort and accommodate KBCT guidance subsystem for biopsy while maintaining breast coverage; the Company achieving ISO 13485 certification; bolstering Quality Assurance, production manufacturing, service and clinical training plans; performing clinical trials to prove the safety and effectiveness of KBCT that are equivalent to current diagnostic work-up (diagnostic mammography and ultrasound); and, most importantly, obtaining FDA clearance.

While the global positioning system (GPS) has proven beneficial in supporting outdoor navigation, this technology has previously been unavailable for indoor usage. Koronis Biomedical Technologies (KBT) believes the use of new highly sensitive GPS receivers augmented with advanced dead reckoning technology will provide a solution for improving indoor navigation for the visually impaired. Dead-reckoning uses measures of heading and velocity to provide a three dimensional positioning solution based on a known starting point. KBT proposes to develop a small indoor personal navigation aid to support blind/low-vision travel. The commercialization of such a device would have immediate benefit on the independence and quality of life for a large market segment of our society, as the World Health Organization estimates over 12 million U.S. citizens have some form of uncorrected vision loss, with these projections doubling by the year 2030. In this phase II SBIR project, KBT will develop a production-ready personal navigation device that supports indoor route guidance and location-based information. The key advantage of our approach is that the device does not require building modifications and is developed around a user-centered interface thoroughly tested in several human behavioral studies. The KBT device will also leverage the software platform of an existing outdoor navigation system for the blind, thus representing the first viable system supporting seamless indoor/outdoor travel.

        "abstract": "Biomass-derived ethanol is now an integral part of the overall transportation fuel system in the U.S.  To be useful as fuel grade ethanol, large amounts of water must be evaporated from dilute fermentation alcohol, a process that is energy-intensive, costly, and an impediment to the transition to a biofuels economy.  By 2012, the total distillation energy required for water evaporation from dilute fermentation ethanol will approach 270 trillion BTU/yr.  This project will demonstrate the technical feasibility of a novel reactive technology to reduce or substantially eliminate the reliance on distillation for water removal from biomass-derived ethanol.  In this approach, a novel reagent will be added to the crude ethanol to convert the water into a highly volatile product, which is readily removed from the ethanol with a substantially reduced energy input.  The reagent is then regenerated off-line by reversing the reaction and producing water, which is removed by simple decanting and phase separation.  Phase I demonstrated that fuel-grade ethanol meeting commercial specifications could be produced by reactive dehydration.  Phase II will entail optimizing the performance of the reactive dehydration catalysts for maximum energy savings.  To facilitate early commercialization, the technology will be demonstrated through operation in a prototype unit.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The reactive dehydration system should find immediate application to the production of fuel-grade ethanol from biomass materials, saving at least 35 trillion BTU\u00bfs in 2015 and resulting in annual cost savings of $700 million.

Alternative acetic acid production technologies based on direct oxidation of ethane or ethylene exist, but these technologies suffer from poor oxidation selectivity, poor energy efficiency, and wasted hydrocarbon resources.  This project will utilize a photocatalytic technology for the selective oxidation of ethane to acetic acid.  In this approach, photocatalytic oxidation uses UV light to produce acetic acid at ambient temperatures and pressure, with exceptionally high selectivity to acetic acid.  Phase I developed novel photocatalyst compositions, which produced acetic acid from ethane in very high yield, reduced energy consumption by one-half, reduced waste of hydrocarbon resources, and reduced generation of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A field-portable instrument that can determine blood levels of specific toxic metals is vital in establishing the link between toxic exposure, induced mutation, and genetic expression. In addition, screening of vulnerable populations for toxic metal exposure is critical to permit timely medical intervention to mitigate physiological damage. Such measurements are therefore important for both clinical and epidemiological applications. Standard assay methods require trained personnel to obtain samples to be sent to off-site laboratories, increasing costs and handling errors, and imposing a delay in identifying exposure sources. The overall goal of the proposed work will be to develop a small, easy-to-use, hand-held instrument used with disposable silicon microchips to provide rapid, in-field simultaneous detection of lead, cadmium, and zinc in a single sub-microliter blood sample. The microsampling and assay chip integrates a microneedle comparable in size to a human hair for painless blood sampling with a microcuvette containing an electrochemical detection structure. The biochip can be cost- effectively fabricated using MEMS (microelectromechanical systems) technology. The assay will employ electrochemical-stripping analysis; a proven technique for an accurate and precise detection of trace quantities of toxic heavy metals without requiring sample de-oxygenation. The instrument is ideal for field use, and can be used by untrained personnel. Phase I demonstrated feasibility by: developing the assay and validating it with in vitro testing, designing the microchip and fabricating key components, and developing components of the measurement and control instrumentation. In Phase II, a complete prototype system will be fabricated and evaluated. This system will consist of a hand-held instrument that will be used in conjunction with a single-use consumable. Both in vitro testing and in vivo testing in animal models will validate performance of the prototype system.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Successful completion of this work will lead to the development of a small, easy-to-use, hand- held instrument to provide rapid, in-field simultaneous detection of lead, cadmium and zinc in blood, using a miniature electrochemical-stripping assay in a silicon microchip disposable. The ability to provide rapid in-field or point-of-care data will substantially improve treatment of overexposure to toxic agents, and improve public health. Furthermore, examining the global effects of toxic metals on gene expression will help researchers determine patterns of biological response, and discover the underlying mechanisms of toxicity.",

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to develop a turnkey sputter deposition system to provide low temperature thin film deposition of transparent conductive oxide (TCO) materials. A laboratory scale film deposition system using a closed-field magnetron sputtering with RF plasma enhancement was demonstrated. The thin films were grown at lower temperatures than most competing processes. One key advantage of the deposition process developed is its ability to produce TCOs without the need for post-treatments (to achieve both good resistivity and transparency) thereby simplifying the process compatible for high-volume processing of large flat polymeric substrates. The project will demonstrate the process compatible with alternative TCO materials and with photovoltaic applications.  The broader impact/commercial potential from this technology will be innovations in photovoltaic (PV) technology. The ability to tap solar energy more efficiently will lead to major breakthroughs for many devices. For years, silicon (Si) solar cells have been the backbone of the solar industry using monocrystalline Si substrate with multiple layers of p-n junction diodes. However, one of the main limiting factors is the\nshortage of silicon for PV applications as it competes with the existing requirements in the semiconductor industry. Many different PV alternatives are in active development which utilizes TCO materials to provide the conductive anode, cathode, or both. Thin film solar cells provide a good alternative to Si-based solar cells as long as the fabrication cost can be reduced. Thin film solar cells use layers of semiconducting materials with little micrometer thickness and deposited on glass, stainless steel or flexible substrates. One cost-effective method to produce PV devices is through the use of polymers. However, the current device performance of polymer-based PV devices is low but can further be improved by fabricating metal oxide semiconductors embedded on the polymer-based device structure. Thus, this technology will be cost-competitive if the fabrication of TCO thin films are proven they can be done on large-area flexible substrates at lower temperatures.",

The results obtained during Phase I and the anticipated Phase II results will set the stage for Phase III commercial participation by our financing partners and for rapid deployment of this proprietary chip technology in portable, hand-held analytical instruments.  The world is\nrunning out of \"\"quality\"\" water for drinking and agricultural purposes. At the same time, public health agencies do not have the time, equipment, or resources to proactively check for hazardous chemicals in our drinking water, our water sources, or our food on a routine basis. Recent scares regarding melamine in baby food and pet food, bisphenol A in drinking water bottles, or perchlorate in ground water demonstrate the fragility of the water and food systems. Typical analysis requires collecting a sample in the field and shipping the sample to a test laboratory; water monitoring agencies depend upon these outsourced laboratories where transport and processing time can take days to produce results, wasting precious time when the health of a community is at stake. Existing portable tools can measure a few parts per million, whereas hazardous compounds are often regulated in the part per billion range. Handheld tools that measure a wide array of compounds at a parts-per-billion or better level would be a powerful, valuable, and necessary addition to the analysis toolbox.",

The broader impact/commercial potential from this technology will be availability of high reliability, high performance capacitors for critical applications at a reasonable price due to lower cost of manufacturing.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this research plan is to transition the development of the UltraMag ventricular assist system, which is designed to support neonates and small children, from the preclinical to the clinical trial phase. The work will culminate in a single center, prospective, nonrandomized, open-label, clinical trial. The 2001 report of the NHLBI) sponsored Task Force on Research in Pediatric Cardiovascular Disease identified the pressing need for novel systems to support children with severely compromised cardiac disorders. The pediatric ventricular assist device under development by Levitronix and its development partners, the Texas Heart Institute (THI) and the University of Pittsburgh (UoP), is intended to fulfill the need for acute to chronic mechanical circulatory life support for up to 6-months in infants and small children. Our goal will be to create a viable clinical product for infants and small children, based on the core magnetically levitated technology developed by Levitronix. Uniquely, this small centrifugal pump has no seals, bearings, or other movable parts that are traditionally associated with thrombus formation or mechanical failure. In Phase I of the project, we demonstrated the soundness of this technology for the pediatric application through a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments. In Phase II of the project, we optimized the pump design to accommodate the hemodynamic conditions typical for the pediatric patient, and demonstrated effective hemodynamic performance and biocompatibility in a series of in vivo implants simulating typical clinical conditions. Acknowledging the importance and clinical need of advancing this technology rapidly into the clinical arena, we propose here a Phase II Continuation Grant to support the completion of the hardware development to its final clinical form, performance of a series of final pre-clinical animal validation studies using clinical- grade hardware, followed by initiation of the clinical trial under an FDA approved investigational device exemption (IDE). Our specific Aims include: Aim 1: Demonstrate device endurance and biocompatibility in a juvenile ovine model to confirm readiness for clinical trials providing support up to 180 days. Physiological performance and biocompatibility of the blood pump, control systems, and cannulae will be assessed. Aim 2: Conduct  preliminary clinical safety and probable benefit  trial for up to 180 days of the proposed system in 8 children (ranging from neonate to children weighing up to 40 kg) with decompensated congestive cardiomyopathy. The study will consist of a single-site trial to assess survival, hemodynamic effect, possible thrombogenesis, device reliability, reversal of end-organ dysfunction, and potential for weaning andrecovery. The ultimate goal is to gather sufficient data to convince FDA to allow continuation of the trial to prove safety and probable benefit en route to an HDE. Levitronix intends to financially support the clinical trial costs beyond the first eight patients until FDA approval is obtained. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The UltraMag system is being developed to address the need to support children with cardiomyopathies who face the constant threat of death due to heart failure. The pediatric ventricular assist device is intended to fulfill the need for temporary cardiac life support (up to 180-days) in infants and small children.",

Yet, such an analyzer is required to support the widespread deployment needed to achieve a better understanding of the global methane budget and to quantify exchanges between the atmosphere and terrestrial biosphere.  Building on an open-path methane analyzer developed previously, this project will develop a tunable diode laser-based closed-path CH4 and H2O gas analyzer.  The new closed-path instrument will use newly-developed laser technology:  vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSEL) and wavelength modulation spectroscopy (WMS).  Compared to cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS), VCSEL and WMS will provide better spectral performance (especially at ambient pressure), lower power consumption, high sensitivity, and less susceptibility to mirror contamination.  Phase I demonstrated the feasibility of developing a closed-path CH4 and H2O gas analyzer with VCSEL and WMS.  The resolution of this analyzer was better than 2 ppb CH4\u00b7(Hz)-1/2, which exceeded the required specification for methane flux measurement.  Phase II will (1) develop a closed-path CH4 and H2O gas analyzer prototype, using a VCSEL, a dense-pattern multi-pass optical cell, and WMS; and (2) develop the instrument-embedded and application software.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Available methane analysis methods, such as gas chromatography and mass spectroscopy,  are not suitable for long-term continuous field measurement, and laser-based CRDS requires main power, ultraclean optics, and isolation from the environment.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bioinformatics and biochemical analysis suggests that the human genome encodes ~ 100 proteins known as deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs). DUBs constitute an important class of enzymes that deconjugate ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteins (UBL) from their target proteins. Protein uniquitination serves many functions in the cell, including proteasome-mediated degradation of poly-ubiquitin tagged proteins. DUBs are thus key regulators that play a very important role in the fate of cellular proteins. In Phase I it was proposed to study a limited number of DUBs to test the feasibility of a catalytically active array as well as a DUB array for serum biomarkers. This study has been completed successfully and, for Phase II, LifeSensors plans to develop an array covering most of the deUBLases and selected Ub-ligases (UBL-enzymes) for profiling serum samples; specifically, two types of array are proposed: (1) a complete UBL-enzyme antibody array to monitor signature(s) of UBL-enzymes associated with disease and normal states; and (2) an array in which all of the UBL enzymes are utilized to monitor human sera for auto-antibodies that may serve as biomarkers in health and disease. UBL-enzyme microarrays developed in this study will represent important advances for research, biomarker discovery, diagnostics/prognostics, and therapeutics. The ubiquitin pathway is the most conserved pathway of eukaryotic origin. Aberrations in such highly conserved pathways are likely to lead to pathologies. The expression of various DUBs has been associated with diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and neurodegenerative disease (PD, AD), to name a few. Over- or under-expression of proteins in disease states tend to elicit elevated or diminished auto-antibody production against those proteins. Thus, auto-antibody profiling can help to identify the type and stage of a disease. The ubiquitin pathway and DUBs in particular are emerging as sources of novel therapeutic targets, and the development of UBL-enzyme arrays that identify signatures in disease tissue will doubtless facilitate target validation as well as serve as biomarkers. Given the Phase I success, a comprehensive plan for the development of UBL-enzyme microarrays from the human genome has been proposed. A key aspect of this plan is a collaboration with the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center wherein the new UBL-enzyme biomarker arrays will be characterized by screening from among the institute's many human serum repositories. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ubiquitin- and ubiquitin-related pathways play a central role in cellular homeostasis and regulation. These pathways involve a Yin/Yang of conjugation and deconjugation of the small ubiquitin-like proteins to target proteins. Dysregulation of these pathways has been implicated in cancer, inflammatory and cardiovascular diseases, and neurodegeneration. LifeSensors proposes to develop an assay technology for the majority of the members of these pathways, over 100 distinct proteins. This assay has the potential to identify new biomarkers for the early diagnosis of these diseases.",

        "abstract": "The DOE is responsible for the remediation of 1.7 trillion gallons of contaminated ground water and 40 million cubic meters of contaminated soil generated from weapons production activities at 7000 discrete sites.  In order to maintain site stewardship, the DOE requires improved instrumentation to study subsurface transport, develop models, and improve remediation strategies.  In particular, measurements of water isotope ratios are critical to understanding the migration and flow of contaminated groundwater.  Currently, these measurements require taking discrete samples to mass spectrometry laboratories, a process that is expensive and labor intensive.  This project will develop a field-deployable water isotope analyzer that can provide rapid (< 20 minutes) quantification of dD and d18O to better than \u00b11.0 \u00bf and \u00b10.3 \u00bf, sufficient for isotope hydrology studies.  Phase I fabricated and deployed an analyzer that measured dD and d18O to better than 0.6 \u00bf and 0.2 \u00bf in < 16 minutes.  A sampling system was developed to draw water from different sources and direct them into the instrument for quantification.  The prototype system was deployed in a forest for 4 weeks and yielded the first-ever high-frequency quantification of isotope data over a long time period.  Phase II will develop three analyzers for continuous measurements of 2H/1H and 18O/16O water isotope ratios in the field.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The analyzers would be used to validate subsurface transport models and provide continuous monitoring of water flow pathways.  In addition to the DOE application to the remediation of contaminated facilities, the proposed sensor could be marketed for environmental research and medical diagnostics.

The Water Isotope Analyzer will be capable of real-time monitoring of oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in human and animal biological samples (blood, urine, saliva) directly and without distillation. In this effort, LGR is collaborating with KineMed Inc. and Metabolic Solutions Inc. to develop and deploy this inexpensive, portable and fast instrument for measurements of 2H/1H (or D/H) and 18O/16O in biological samples directly (without distillation) with a target precision of better than 1 per mil for D/H and 0.4 per mil for 18O/16O. System performance will be demonstrated first in gravimetrically prepared water samples and subsequently in aqueous biological (human and animal) samples. All results will be validated by direct comparison with Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry (IRMS) measurements made on the same samples. LGR will develop the instrument, MSI and LGR will develop the direct injection strategy, and MSI and KineMed will provide the test samples and measure them using IRMS.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lpath Inc. has developed a novel cancer therapeutic agent, ASONEPTM, a humanized monoclonal antibody, which neutralizes the tumorigenic and angiogenic growth factor, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P). S1P is an unusual target as it is a bioactive lipid. Thus ASONEP potentially represents a first-in-class anti-cancer agent. ASONEP is currently in Phase 1 trials for cancer. For this grant, we are requesting matching funds for clinical development and commercialization of ASONEP. Lpath has performed a comprehensive series of pre-clinical efficacy and pharmacokinetic studies to confirm the potential anti-cancer utility of the anti-S1P antibody. The neutralization of extracellular S1P mediated by the anti-S1P mAb could result in a marked decrease in cancer progression in humans as a result of inhibition of tumor proliferation and the growing vasculature needed to support tumor growth. Furthermore, recent research suggests that many angiogenesis inhibitors may also act as anti-invasive and anti-metastatic compounds which could also mitigate the spread of cancer to sites distant from the initial tumor.        Up-regulation of the oncogene, sphingosine kinase 1 (sphk1) and the resulting release of S1P into the tumor microenvironment represents an important mechanism by which cancer cells acquire resistance to treatment as the cancer progresses. We hypothesize that overexpression of the SphK1 enzyme and the increased production and release of its product, S1P, could be responsible for resistance to cytotoxics and other treatments in a wide variety of cancer lineages. Using S1P as a biomarker and SphK1 as a surrogate marker, we believe that it may be possible to identify patients whose resistance can be attributed to an up-regulation of the S1P system. We will investigate whether sensitivity to therapy can be promoted in these patients with ASONEP in combination with standard treatments against which the patient has developed resistance as a consequence of S1P up-regulation.        In moving towards commercialization, we will conduct one Phase 1b safety trial and one Phase 2a clinical trial in selected cancer types based on potential efficacy in the Phase 1 study and/or those demonstrating a promise of efficacy from preclinical and clinical biomarker studies. As requested by the FDA, a 13-week safety study in nonhuman primates will be completed prior to initiation of these Phase 2a studies. In support of the Phase 1b and 2a studies, we will also conduct a biomarker study designed to provide validation of sphingolipid-specific biomarkers (i.e. plasma S1P) and surrogate markers (e.g., tissue SphK1) to help aid in the selection of patients and cancer disease types where resistance to standard treatment may be attributed to an up-regulation of the S1P signaling system. Multivariate analysis will also be performed to assess the correlation of S1P-specific biomarkers/surrogate markers with other relevant signals that will be obtained from genomic and proteomic arrays of patient samples. This aim will be used to support future Phase 0 biomarker studies not supported by the SBIR Bridge grant. As an additional specific aim of the project, we will conduct preclinical studies using animal xenografts and transgenic mouse models intending to demonstrate that acquired resistance to cytotoxics and other treatments could be reversed by anti-S1P treatment. Efficacy studies will determine whether the anti-S1P mAb treatment can re-establish sensitivity to treatment. These studies will be used in conjunction with the biomarker/surrogate marker studies to select primary indications for future Phase 2 efficacy trials.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The long term objective of this research is to develop improved DNA polymerases that will substantially advance Sanger and  next generation  sequencing technologies. The primary goal of the Phase I research was to develop a rapid and inexpensive method to perform Sanger sequencing directly from single bacterial colonies. This method bypasses the time and expense of template purification needed for conventional DNA sequencing. It is based on the development of a modified Taq fusion DNA polymerase (DNAP) with improved DNA affinity and processivity. Chromosomal integration and expression of such a polymerase into host cells used for cloning should enable a new concept, termed  Ex cyto sequencing . Analogous to colony PCR, Ex cyto sequencing will eliminate the overnight growth of bacterial cultures, expensive template purification, and the purchase of purified DNA polymerase. In the Phase I research we developed a new fusion polymerase with novel enzymatic attributes, which was shown to improve multiple aspects of nucleic acid sequencing and amplification. In addition to sequencing trace amounts of DNA from a single bacterial colony, the new Taq fusion polymerase enabled the following procedures: sequencing difficult templates unresolved by other enzymes, sequencing directly from liquid cultures using as little as 5 ul of outgrowth media, tight DNA binding in a variety of buffer conditions, and long PCR (10 kb). The specific aims of the Phase II proposal are to complete the development and optimization of Ex cyto sequencing and to modify other DNA polymerases used in next generation sequencing, such as Bst, Klenow, and T4 DNAPs. These improved enzymes should provide superior read lengths and the ability to sequence through difficult structures, thereby improving the accuracy of base calling and the subsequent assembly of genomes. These enzymes will improve numerous nucleic acid synthesis applications, such as emulsion PCR, used for the in vitro clonal amplification of templates, whole genome amplification, long PCR amplification, and a host of other methods that are constrained by existing DNAP capabilities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The success of the human genome project has spawned explosive growth in the demand for DNA sequence information. The discovery of new genes from a variety of species will have a large impact on understanding human health and disease. Despite improvements in speed and reduction in costs of DNA sequence analysis, the process is still time, labor, and cost-intensive. This proposal seeks to dramatically improve the speed while decreasing the costs of DNA sequencing by developing a next generation DNA polymerase.",

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop an optical-maskless-lithography technology that is capable of high resolution, high throughput, flexibility, low cost, and extendibility. Current lithography technologies suffer from the problems of high tool costs, high mask costs, and inflexibility (in the case of optical-projection lithography), or high tool costs, very low throughputs, and high complexity (in the case of scanning-electron-beam lithography).  The emerging Zone-Plate-Array-Lithography (ZPAL) technology and its optical extension to sub-100 nanometers via absorbance-modulation optical lithography (AMOL) will mitigate these issues, while providing unprecedented flexibility in nanopatterning. The proposed project covers three major thrusts: firstly, the manufacture of zone-plate arrays containing over 1000 zone plates, each with a numerical-aperture (NA) greater than 0.85; second, the manufacture of dichromat arrays containing over 1000 zone plates, each with a numerical-aperture (NA) greater than 0.85; and\nlastly, the design of high-efficiency lenses to overcome many of limitations of conventional zone plates and dichromats.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is aimed at developing a high speed and high sensitivity system for measuring optical dimensions of human eye, such as the total axial length, corneal thickness and the location and thickness of the crystalline lens, in a non-contact manner using infrared light, invisible to the eye. This task is accomplished by improving the existing technique of time domain low-coherence interferometry. In case of a live patient, who cannot be immobilized for steady measurements, speed and sensitivity of the measurements are especially important to achieve high accuracy and precision.  The broader impacts of this research are aimed at benefiting large part of the population that suffers from cataract and other vision problems. The U.S. population of over 65 years old expected to increase to over 70 million in 2030. Therefore, there is a dramatic need for tools to treat the wave of eye diseases and problems inherent to such population. Information on the structure of the eye is required in eye surgeries, including those that deal with replacing the crystalline lenses affected by cataract. The proposed research will result in an array of critical tools aimed at mapping out the eye, for medical research and for treatment of the diseases.",

In Phase I, experimental demonstrations proved the feasibility of the SONIC concept by reacting the sol-gel glass with a polymer hybrid matrix.  In Phase II, the SONIC process will be optimized, and the formulation will be scaled up for roll-to-roll mass production Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The proposed technology should enable low-cost, easily manufactured, and mass-producible water/oxygen protective barriers for both rigid and flexible photovoltaic cells/modules.  The overall cost of manufacturing photovoltaic cells/modules would be reduced by 50 percent, compared to the double-glass vacuum laminating system currently used.

The CXS is a project to design and build a combination of x-ray optics, endstations, and software that use the monochromatic, tunable x-ray beam produced by the CLS. The CXS project, though not yet complete, has already resulted in an almost turnkey scientific instrument - a synchrotron-like x-ray system - for structural biologists at academic and corporate research centers. In order to make a significant reduction in data collection time, especially for small crystals, enhancements to the CLS are needed. In response to the NIH Notice:  NIH Announces the Availability of Recovery Act Funds for Competitive Revision Applications  - NOT-OD-09-058, we plan to expand the scope of the CXS grant to include several hardware upgrades to the CLS and to fund additional operations time. These efforts will result in significantly more x-ray flux and better reliability of the CLS, which together will greatly improve the impact and performance of the CXS.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Compact X-ray Station for Protein Crystallography (CXS), along with the Compact Light Source (CLS), provides the technology to bring state-of-the-art macromolecular crystallography to structural biologists in their own local or regional laboratories.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The availability of safe drinking water is an important health concern. The introduction of water chlorination as a standard water treatment has resulted in a significant decrease in the number of waterborne diseases. However disinfection byproducts (DBPs) are formed by the reactions between chlorine and the natural organic matter (NOM), bromide, and iodide dissolved in water. Long-term exposure to DBPs increases the risk of cancer and other adverse health effect. As a consequence, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has implemented stringent limits for some DBPs in drinking water. The use of alternative disinfectants is gaining popularity since they lower the levels of regulated DBPs. However, they form high levels of new and/or unregulated DBPs, some of which are more cytotoxic and genotoxic than regulated DBPs. Similar situation occurs when drinking water utilities exploit the use of source waters impaired by wastewater effluents beyond pristine water supplies to accommodate drinking water needs of population growth. These changes to drinking water disinfection are creating a host of emerging, highly toxic DBPs, raising concern because EPA's regulated DBPs are not necessarily the most toxic or common DBPs. And water plant approaches to reduce NOM in source water prior to disinfection are not technically sound because it requires a new water treatment plant that is costly to construct and operate. Thus, new methods to eliminate DBPs in drinking water at the point-of-use (POU) are strongly needed.  During the current Phase II grant, a new photocatalytic oxidation system for POU water treatment is being developed. The aim is to provide a unique, safe, low-cost consumer device designed to effectively eliminate DBPs and microorganisms at the location where water is consumed. Our photocatalytic system has successfully treated water samples containing regulated DBPs. In addition, this POU system considerably improves drinking water quality by degrading both microorganisms and DBPs well bellow EPA levels. To address raising concern related to emerging DBPs, we request funding for this Revision Application to expand the scope of the specific aims, research design, and methods of the current Phase II grant by carrying out studies in the destruction of toxic, unregulated, emerging DBPs using Lynntech's photocatalytic system. If our product is successful, we will contribute not only to solve a serious health threat (by rendering DBPs harmless (independent of the disinfecting agent used by the water treatment plant) and providing safe, clean drinking water), but also by helping the American economy: by acquiring Amercican technology essential to expand the goals of the current grant and by hiring, training, and supporting personnel to carry out work to accomplish the Revision Application goals. In addition, Lynntech's product will be sold to American hospitals and schools, and through normal channels of commercialization, it will be sold to American households.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: While it is vitally important to disinfect drinking water, as thousands of people died from waterborne illnesses before disinfection practices were started in the early 1900s, it is also important to minimize the exposure to disinfection byproducts (DBPs), which are formed by the reactions between the disinfecting agent and the natural organic matter (NOM), bromide, and iodide dissolved in water. Long-term exposure to DBPs increases the risk of cancer and other adverse health effect. The goal of this Competitive Revision Application is to support the expansion of the Phase II scope (that demonstrated Lynntech's POU photocatalytic system successful destruction of regulated DBPs) by demonstrating the effective destruction of toxic, emerging, unregulated DBPs, some of which are more cytotoxic and genotoxic than EPA's regulated DBPs.",

In this approach, an immobilized lipase is used as a heterogeneous biocatalyst to transform renewable oils into biodiesel.  However, immobilized lipases catalyze the transesterification reaction slowly.  Also, they are poisoned by high methanol concentrations, which preclude their industrial implementation.  This project will modify a promising commercially-available immobilized lipase to improve the rate of methanol transesterification and to improve the stability of the catalyst in the presence of high concentrations of methanol.  In Phase I, a commercially available immobilized lipase was modified with different substituents, and it was demonstrated the modified materials catalyzed the transesterification reaction faster than unmodified catalyst.  In addition, the modified catalyst was used multiple times without a decrease in performance.  In Phase II, (1) the performance of the catalyst will be further improved; (2) its activity will be characterized to define the operational envelope of the material; (3) its performance will be determined as a function of re-use cycle; and (4) a preliminary design for industrially-sized batch and continuous transesterification processes will be developed.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a vital need for effective treatments against seizure-related brain damage and other events of excitotoxic neurodegeneration. Recurring seizures can result from epilepsy, brain trauma, developmental disorders, exposure to toxins, military-threat agents, and drugs of abuse (including prenatal exposure). Seizure-induced damage involves the same excitotoxic over-activation of glutamate receptors as occurs in stroke and traumatic brain injury. The resulting brain damage can cause devastating neurological, cognitive, and neuropsychiatric problems. With the need to find better therapeutic avenues, this proposal will further develop drugs to enhance the neuroprotective activation of the endocannabinoid system that occurs in response to excitotoxic insults including seizures. Compensatory synthesis and release of endogenous anandamide have been linked to excitotoxic protection in the brain. Our SBIR Phase-I work identified novel inhibitors of the endocannabinoid-hydrolyzing enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) that effectively reduced seizure severity as well as the associated brain damage and behavioral deficits, even when administered several hours post-insult. This Phase-II proposal will continue to take advantage of the convenient KA rat model of seizure induction in order to facilitate the timely assessment of new,  drugable  FAAH inhibitor analogs with improved physicochemical and pharmacological profiles. The overall goal is to generate one potential candidate and three back-ups as selective, potent, and safe neuroprotectants for development as first-in-class drugs for treating seizure-related damage and other types of excitotoxic insults that cause long-term neurological impairment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful development of medications to treat diseases whose etiology involves excitotoxic brain injury and its symptoms (particularly, seizures) will satisfy pressing medical needs for various disorders (stroke; Alzheimer's, Huntington's, and Parkinson's diseases; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) for which extant therapies offer marginal value. Drugs of abuse may act as neurotoxicants and incite excitotoxic brain injury and seizures, and their neurodegenerative effects can adversely affect the developing fetus in utero. The latter is of particular importance to NIDA's mission. Our overall goal is to generate one potential development candidate and three back-ups to address the therapeutic needs of these disorders.",

The intellectual merit of this project lies in the development of new detection methods that are essential for improving high-throughput genomic microarray analyses of gene activity.  Problems with current microarray and genomic analysis techniques, including hybridization perturbation, slow enzymatic labeling methods using expensive labeled nucleotides and sequence dependence, are solved using a direct labeling approach. These new systems will provide the detection tools needed to advance the promising pharmaceutical, research and diagnostic uses of genomic analysis to determine the pattern of gene expression in disease or upon therapeutic treatment.  Marker Gene Technologies, Inc. has established the feasibility of these detection methods by preparing new ultrasensitive fluorescent labeling reagents and developing protocols for directly labeling DNA or RNA samples isolated from live cells.  These reagents are able to efficiently and sensitively label oligonucleotides for high-throughput microarray analysis.  In Phase II these systems will be validated by further analysis of the fluorescent labeling methods and\ncharacterization of their ability to monitor changes in gene expression upon application of drugs or other bioactive compounds or in response to biological changes in cell function or disease, in a cell-specific manner.  The broader impacts of this project include development and commercialization of new methods for rapid screening of genomic expression patterns in response to specific drug application in normal cells and tissues as well as in disease, bacterial or viral infections.  These methods are a significant improvement over existing technologies by using a direct labeling approach that is quicker, more accurate and more cost-effective.  These systems will be marketed to the pharmaceutical and diagnostics industries for high-throughput pre-clinical screening of drug efficacy by comparative cellular genomic analysis. In addition, existing collaborations with industrial and research partners assure quick commercial development of the technology.  The combined techniques will improve U.S. competitiveness in the burgeoning genomic analysis field as well as in pharmaceutical therapeutic drug development and lead to further job creation based on both the products and systems developed.",

        "abstract": "Titanium with its inherent lightweight, corrosion resistance and mechanical properties is a critical and strategic metal in civilian and defense aviation, oil extraction and processing, water purification, the general chemical industry, and would be in automotive transportation if it were more economical.  The entire world\u00bfs supply of titanium as a sponge has been produced by the Kroll process for over a half century.  The Kroll process is the magnesium reduction of titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4).  The Kroll process is a low productivity, batch, segmented, labor intensive process in which the operations are generally carried out at separate sights resulting in high cost storage, handling and transport of the environmentally hazardous materials chlorine (Cl2), titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4), molten magnesium (Mg), and molten magnesium chloride (MgCl2).  The purpose of this research was to develop a continuous low cost innovative alternative to the Kroll process that utilized the same production demonstrated Kroll chemistry to produce high value added titanium powder which eliminated the environmental hazardous materials and which meets environmental benign green manufacturing standards. The alternate processing to eliminate any storage, handling or transportation of the hazardous reactant materials consists of producing a titanium suboxide-carbon material by carbothermic reduction of an ore/TiO2 producing Ti:O:C in a stoichiometric ratio such as Ti2OC.  This Ti:O:C serves as an anode feed to a MgCl2 electrolysis cell where the electrolytically generated chloride ion at the anode reacts with the Ti:O:C to in-situ produce TiCl4 that is dected to the cathode surface where the electrolytically generated Mg reduces the TiCl4 to titanium powder and regeneration of the MgCl2.  Since this is a cyclic system, the feed to the cell is Ti:O:C with Ti powder continuously produced and the elimination of separately handling any hazardous materials.  The Phase I program demonstrated the in-situ process in a bench scale cell on a continuous basis as well as producing a Ti-B alloy powder.  An economic analysis suggests that the environmentally benign process can produce titanium powder for approximately $1.35/lb.  The Phase II program is to scale-up processing with operations on a continuous basis to demonstrate commercial viability and confirm low cost processing that meets environmentally benign green manufacturing standards.  The produced powder will be independently analyzed to establish ASTM grade and will be provided to outside sources to quality for direct use in powder metallurgy fabrication as well as melting for equivalency to Kroll sponge processing.  The commercialization option will scale to the pilot stage to demonstrate commercial production capability, confirm environmental benign green manufacturing capability, the economics of the process, and confirm the produced titanium powder is at least equivalent to Kroll sponge quality.",

This project will develop a novel, high performance, triple function fuel cell electrode, which will function as a catalytic promoter for reduction or oxidation reactions, as a current collector, and as a channel for gas flow.  Phase I demonstrated that the performance of the catalytic electrode can be significantly increased by using a high-surface-area carbon-nanotube substrate, which retards catalyst particle agglomeration and increases substrate conductivity.  Phase II will focus on further increasing the surface area and conductivity of this new substrate by adjusting the processing conditions and by achieving a deeper understanding of the mechanism of this surprising improvement.  In addition, the cost-effectiveness and commercial viability of the developed materials will be evaluated for their use in methanol fuel cells.

This project will establish a cost-effective manufacturing process for enhancing the properties of these metal foams by increasing the uniformity and controlling the size of pores.  In Phase I, two approaches, both based on using filler to provide uniform interstitial spaces for the metal, were investigated.  In one approach (PCM technology) the filler was removable; in the other approach (SARB technology) the filler was composed of non-removable highly-resilient beads, which contribute to increased energy absorption.  The process parameters were investigated and foam materials were produced and tested.  Exceptional compressive strength, modulus, and energy absorption were obtained, and cost estimates for both processes were established.  The PCM technology resulted in lighter weight foam with relatively good properties, but at potentially higher costs.  The SARB process produced foams with exceptional properties at a very competitive cost but at a slightly higher weight.  In Phase II, both processes will be scaled-up, and foams and structures will be fabricated for testing and validation of performance and cost. Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The new materials should provide opportunities for efficient, high yield production of lightweight energy absorbing vehicle components, which would enable weight savings, cost savings, and enhanced safety.

        "abstract": "Hydrogen has been widely used by petroleum refineries in upgrading processes necessary to facilitate the hydrotreating/catalytic hydrocracking of heavy hydrocarbon molecules and the reduction of sulfur content.  However, the building of the infrastructure needed to transport hydrogen from central production facilities to small refineries is cost prohibitive.  This project will develop an advanced, thermally and electrically self-sustaining, electrochemical hydrogen generation system for small petroleum refineries applications.  In Phase I, electrode materials were identified and deposited using different approaches, an electrochemical device was successfully developed and fabricated, and proof-of-concept tests were performed.  Both hydrogen production and power generation, directly using petcoke, was demonstrated.  Phase II will focus on improvements and scaling of the hydrogen production technology.  Over 500 hours of long-term tests will be performed to investigate possible degradation mechanisms, and the hydrogen production process will be demonstrated at bench-top scale.     Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The technology should enable refineries to convert a locally available inexpensive feedstock, petroleum coke, into hydrogen at a cost much lower than the cost of purchasing hydrogen from a central production facility.  Other benefits would include (1) no need for fuel clean-up or secondary purification of the hydrogen product; (2) versatile operations for hydrogen/power generation; (3) a sequestration-ready CO2 production; and (4) a marketable by-product.",

        "abstract": "In planar Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFC), separation of the anode and cathode side gases are achieved by hermetic seals.  These seals may be rigid, compressive, or compliant.  However, the design of improved sealing materials must address two major challenges:  (1) mechanical stability of the seals in the face of thermal cycling, and (2) chemical stability with respect to the metallic interconnect.  This project will add a nanosize oxide to a prevalent glass composition, along with a novel non-reactive protective coating on the sealing area of the interconnect.  In Phase I, the proposed nanosize-oxide-enhanced glass was characterized for its crystalline-phase development and thermal expansion.  A novel protective coating was applied on the interconnect by a spray technique.  In leak tests and stack tests, the new materials performed better than conventional state-of-the-art materials and showed promise for improved long term performance.  In Phase II, the base glass composition will be fine-tuned, a superior protective coating technique will be perfected, and the material will be characterized, both by itself and in the stack environment. Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The technology should lead to the development of viable sealing solutions for planar SOFC modules, which are preferred for their higher current density.  An effective sealing solution should provide an impetus to clean and efficient energy generation",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During Phase 1 research, the effects of 6 model test materials on a highly differentiated vaginal- ectocervical (VEC) tissue model were studied. Effects on tissue viability, structure, barrier function, and inflammatory cytokine release were monitored. Many of the assays gave results which supported one another and increased confidence in the in vitro results. For instance, histological damage and cytokine release paralleled losses in tissue viability. In addition, decreases in barrier function were measured when tissue viability decreased although the data indicated that barrier function was a more sensitive endpoint (i.e. decreases in barrier function occurred at lower concentrations that did not decrease tissue viability). Importantly, the one material which was mildly irritating in the rabbit vaginal irritation test induced significant decreases in tissue viability and barrier function and increased inflammatory mediator release. In addition, an economic analysis showed the in vitro method to be a cost-effective alternative to the currently used rabbit vaginal irritation test methodology. During Phase 2, the utility of the in vitro assay system will be further expanded to predict vaginal irritation following chronic, repeat exposure. Using the endpoints developed in Phase 1, a prediction model will be developed to accurately assess the in vivo vaginal irritation of test materials and formulations. The method will be transferred to outside contract testing labs and a multi-lab GLP validation study will be performed. In addition, the short and long term reproducibility of the assay will be assessed, and a high throughput version of the assay method will be developed. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A predictive test system for assessing the vaginal irritation potential of chemicals and formulations will have far reaching application in industries involved in women's care products, microbicide, contraceptives, excipient development, and topical pharmaceutical products. Evaluation of vaginal irritation is important to minimize chemical hazards to millions of women. The proposed human reconstructed tissue based system will provide a sensitive and validated assay method for screening of chemicals/formulations with vaginal irritation potential. Furthermore, the assay method will be cost effective and reduce the use of laboratory animals for experimentation.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  As part of a standard toxicological evaluation, all new products must be tested to insure they are not genotoxic. Animal tests are available but European legislation that takes effect in 2009 will ban animal testing. This legislation will affect almost all large US multinational personal care, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical companies. Non-animal, in vitro tests exist; however, they lack specificity and result in an unacceptably high rate of false positives. This leads to a large number of materials being excluded from further development even though are safe. The long term goal of the proposal is to validate an in vitro test method to accurately determine human skin genotoxicity. Phase 1 research made significant progress in developing a reconstructed skin micronucleus (RSMN) assay for genotoxicity testing. A standardized protocol, a pre- screen cytotoxicity assay, and a prediction model (based on statistically significant increases in micronuclei in dividing cells) were defined and tested. A previously published method was improved to increase the sensitivity of the assay for detecting genotoxins requiring metabolic activation. In addition, long term reproducibility studies utilizing tissue from multiple donors showed highly reproducible results. Phase 2 will further build on Phase 1 results to optimize the assay method, automate scoring, expand the database of materials tested, demonstrate interlaboratory reproducibility, and adapt the assay to a high throughput format. These studies will lay the groundwork for formal validation and regulatory acceptance of the assay. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Current genotoxicity test methods rely on animals or in vitro tests. However, the in vitro methods give an unacceptable percentage of false positive test results and animal testing will be banned for US based multinational companies due to pending legislation. This project will develop an in vitro assay which accurately predicts human genotoxicity.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  OptiPush Wheelchair Training System Wheelchair users are over twice as likely to be obese as people in the general population. The solution to obesity in the wheelchair user population is the same as it is in the general population, a healthy diet and regular exercise. The limited availability of wheelchair accessible cardiovascular exercise equipment may be contributing to lack of regular exercise in this population. Obesity among wheelchair users has led to secondary conditions such as heart disease and upper extremity (UE) pain and injury. Over half of the wheelchair user population has developed UE pain and injury. Body weight has been found to be a predictor of UE injury, with heavier users being more prone to injury. In addition to losing weight, training users such that they develop the strength and skills to push with less frequent, long, smooth strokes is currently recommended to help protect them from developing injuries. The OptiPush Wheelchair Training System (WTS) is a wheelchair-accessible treadmill that allows the wheelchair user to improve cardiovascular fitness, exercise capacity, strength and propulsion technique. In Phase I of the project, a proof of concept prototype was developed and evaluated by three wheelchair users during a 6-week exercise study. The wheelchair is secured to the treadmill by a dynamic tether system, which allows the wheelchair to move freely along the length of the treadmill but prevents it from tipping over, veering off course or rolling off the rear. Subjects were able to independently and safely use the OptiPush prototype and experienced significant improvements in cardiovascular health. The goals in Phase II of the project are to improve the design of the OptiPush treadmill and develop a commercial version that can be made available to individual users, gyms and rehabilitation centers. Push cadence and distance biofeedback will be provided to encourage users to use less frequent, long, smooth strokes. As a result of this project, wheelchair users will have increased access to cardiovascular fitness equipment and biofeedback training tools, enabling them to maintain cardiovascular health and improve their propulsion technique. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: OptiPush Wheelchair Training System Relevance to Public Health Manual wheelchair users are at considerable risk of being obese, developing cardiovascular disease and developing upper limb overuse injuries. Two preventative measures are to exercise regularly and follow propulsion technique guidelines. This project will develop a wheelchair accessible treadmill with propulsion biofeedback that enables wheelchair users to independently and safely exercise while improving their propulsion technique.",

        "abstract": "During charge and discharge at high rates and in high abuse situations, a battery can become quite hot, as the heat generated from internal chemical reactions can exceed the battery\u00bfs capability to dissipate the heat.  When internal temperatures become excessive, separator breakdown can result, even after separator shutdown, as the internal cell temperature continues to climb.  Eventually the separator begins to melt and shrink.  Upon shrinking, the electrodes can short circuit, leading to a thermal and/or electrochemical runaway, which possibly could result in explosion and fire.  To develop high-melt-integrity (>200\u00b0C) separators, this project will pursue two approaches based upon traditional solution-based electro-spinning and melt-electro-spinning processes.  During Phase I, a polyimide-based electrospun separator with melt integrity up to 400\u00b0C was produced via solution-based electro-spinning.  This separator performed extremely well during performance testing in a lithium-ion cell.  Phase II will include further development of the melt-based electro-spinning technology, incorporation of shutdown features for both melt and solution based technologies, and demonstration of manufacturing scalability of the electrospun separator.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Separators with higher melt temperatures (>200\u00b0C) would significantly improve a lithium-ion cell\u00bfs resilience to the onset of a thermal runaway situation.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Central nerve system (CNS) related diseases are one of the most prevalent causes of death and reduced life quality among human beings.  In  the  effort  to  understand  and  combat  CNS-related  diseases,  the  ability  to  analyze single neural cells is an important tool distinct from global and regional analyses of the CNS in normal  versus  disease  states,  as  each  neural  cell  has  a  unique  molecular  signature.  However,  single-cell  gene  expression profiling is currently hampered due to the low amount of messenger RNA (mRNA) present in a  single  cell.  The  quantity  of  mRNA  harvested  from  a  single  cell,  estimated  to  be  approximately  0.1-0.2  picograms, is below the level of sensitivity for standard RNA extraction procedures and is likely to have losses  during  the  preamplification  processes.  Furthermore,  because  of  the  dilution  of  the  mRNA  templates  and  reduction in enzymatic efficiency, it often results in biased data, which affects biological interpretation.    Therefore, Maxwell Sensors Inc. proposes to develop an RNA Amplification Nanodrop Processor (RANP) for parallel processing of global mRNA from single mammalian cells.  The  proposed  RANP  utilizes  digital  electrodes  to  control  discrete  droplets  that  enable  RNA  isolation,  cDNA  amplification,  biotin  labeling,  and  target purification on a single chip.  As the result,  microgram  of purified cDNA can be generated from  sub- picogram  of mRNA from a single cell.  The RANP system enables automated processing on a very small volume for multi-step (20-25 steps) reactions, so that sample loading is the only manual step. During the Phase I project, the RANP-chip was designed, fabricated, and tested for cDNA synthesis, SPIA cDNA amplification, cDNA fragmentation, and biotin labeling. Approximately ~500,000-fold amplification was obtained from a few picogram of total RNA. The purified cDNA was in the range of 200-4000 nucleotides, with a peak around 500 bases and no detectable residual primers. This generated 248ng of purified amplified cDNA which is within our Phase I target. This technology offers the potential for robust identification of a single cell's transcriptional profile, which cannot be achieved with current technologies.   Phase II work will focus on design and development of a prototype RANP chip, optimization of the nanodrop  chip, integration of the RANP system for total automation, optimization of the RANP-based bioassay, and  establish the RANP-chip and bioassay specifications.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Central  nerve  system  (CNS)  related  diseases  and  traumas,  such  as  Alzheimer's  and  Parkinson's  disease,  stroke, and spinal cord injury (amongst others), are one of the most prevalent causes of death and reduced life  quality among human beings, and have become a multibillion dollar burden for the US healthcare system. In an effort to understand and treat CNS-related diseases, it is necessary to analyze the gene expression of single neural cells to determine their proper function within the CNS. Maxwell Sensors Inc. proposes to develop a compact lab-on-a-chip system. In contrast to existing technologies, this system will enable gene expression analysis of single cells, helping to find cures for CNS malfunction.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A novel, pulsatile, disposable pump (pediatric MPulse) will be researched for pediatric Cardiopulmonary Bypass surgery which offers physiologic pulsatile blood flow, inherently safe management of low extracorporeal volumes, highly accurate very low flow control, and extended durability for long term cardiopulmonary support. These features address ongoing morbidity concerns due to vital organ injury in pediatric CPB patients caused by non-physiologic blood flows, excessive hemodilution, poor cerebral blood flow, and acute injury due to equipment failure and operator error. In addition, the pediatric MPulse presents a new option for pediatric extended cardiac support. The pediatric MPulse uses a passively filled compliant pumping chamber and operates under Starling principles, like the natural heart. The compliant pump chamber passively fills, and the pump produces a discharge flow based on the volume of fluid that is provided. A physiologic pulsatile flow is created under constant RPM conditions through a novel lengthwise variation of the pumping chamber geometry. Inherent safety advantages prevent retrograde flow, maintain safe circuit pressures, and prevent inadvertent draining of the venous reservoir. Phase I objectives have been met. An MPulse pump chamber geometry has been defined and shown to produce target pulsatility above that of current technology over a range of flow conditions representative of pediatric CPB. Performance targets for durability and hemolysis were met. Phase II research will concentrate on refinement of chamber design for improved blood handling and optimization for robust manufacturing processes. Necessary electronic hardware and software will be developed to support animal studies which will be conducted to demonstrate effectiveness and safety in a clinical setting. All device design, manufacturing process optimization and testing activities will be conducted and documented under design controls to facilitate transfer to a manufacturing partner per our Phase III commercialization plans. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This grant will result in the development of a novel pediatric blood pump for pediatric Cardiopulmonary Bypass surgery with extended durability to allow for long term cardiac support following surgery. Currently, no pump system of this type exists for pediatric patients so physicians have limited options when cardiac support post surgery is necessary.",

        "abstract": "Over 250 drinking water systems exist for small communities in Puerto Rico that serve 25-500 individuals.  These water systems fall outside of Puerto Rico Aquaduct and Sewer Authority and, thus, have no or insufficient water treatment systems.  Water sources for these communities are from ground and surface water with flow rate up to 50,000 gallons per day for a community of 500 people.  To improve upon this water treatment process, the EPA desires improved novel filtration and chlorination methods that can disinfect and filter these drinking water sources.  To address this need, Reactive Innovations, LLC conducted a Phase I SBIR program to develop an on-site hypochlorite generator to continuously chlorinate surface groundwater.  During the Phase I program, we showed that our electro-chemical reactor technology can produce hypochlorite for varying water flow rates upwards to 50,000 gallons per day and required disinfection levels up to t ppm of equivalent chlorine.  The major focus of our water chlorination unit is to minimize its initial and operating costs, thus, the system has few components other than the hypochlorite reactor,  a tank of salt, and a power supply, All of the process water flows through the electrochemical reactor to produce bleach in situ with the flowing water stream and, thus, eliminates slip stream pumps and control systems.  The improved design of our electro-chemical reactor will help to lower the system cost, one of the major drivers for deploying a water disinfection system into the marketplace.  For the Phase II program, we will scale the hypochlorite generator to larger process flow rates, continue minimizing the system complexity and cost, and develop operational hypochlorite generations systems that can operate unattended for one-year at process rates of 50,000 gallons per day.  Commercialization of the technology will be done in concert with water equipment manufacturers and water system providers.  Verification of the technology will be conducted via an outside organization through the EPA\u00bfs Environmental Technology Verification program.  The immediate application of this electrochemical reactor technology is toward an improved chlorination process for small communities in Puerto Rico.  The modular design of the reactor technology will allow us to scale it ot medium and large water disinfection systems as well as scale it ot produce higher levels of sodium hypochlorite for wastewater cleanup.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will develop a shape-memory polymer suture anchor capable of dynamic expansion that will be specifically designed for patients with poor bone mass density. Suture anchors are screw or wedge-like devices that fasten into the bone and are used to secure a detached tendon back onto the bone. Rotator cuff repairs are common surgical procedures involving suture anchors to reduce pain and restore use to an injured shoulder. In 2007, over 460,000 rotator cuff repairs were performed in the US using 1,030,000 suture anchors. Approximately 25 to 35% of rotator cuff repairs are considered unsuccessfully. A general challenge and constraint in rotator cuff repair is the large amount of soft cancellous bone where the anchors must be placed, which makes the anchors more susceptible to migration, loosening/tunnel widening, and pullout. Furthermore, a growing number of patients over 60 years of age are receiving rotator cuff repairs and suffer from osteoporosis. In recent studies, over 54% of patients over the age of 60 with shoulder pain had evidence of rotator cuff tears. Patients with poor bone mass densities are highly at risk of device failure as bone density have been correlated to the fixation strength of the suture anchors. The proposed shape-memory suture anchor will be developed as a tap-in style device, in which the shape- memory effect will be mechanically activated to expand into a wing-shaped device and offer instant fixation. The main advantages of this device are its superior fixation strength in soft bone and increased cyclic performance due to the design's use of shape-memory polymers. The shape-memory suture anchor will also offer reduced complexity and time during installation as a tap-in device, which can utilize a knotless suture approach. Knotless suture anchors instantly secure tendon fixation upon anchor insertion and do not require the surgeon to tie and pass knots of suture from the anchor to the tendon as in traditional anchors. The broad impact of this work will challenge the paradigm of how suture anchors are designed to work in soft bone by utilizing shape-memory materials and a model to predict pullout strength, which was developed in Phase I. This Phase II looks to continue and expand upon the feasibility demonstrated and fundamental information obtained in the successful Phase I efforts of this project. The aims of the Phase II have specifically been designed to fundamentally investigate the design and performance of suture anchors while following an aggressive path towards regulatory approval. The aims involve (1) finalizing the design, (2) developing instrumentation, (3) assessing biocompatibility, (4) validating sterilization, (5) validating performance, and (6) performing a pilot animal study to prove the use of shape-memory suture anchors in-vivo. The primary research team will consist of Chris Yakacki PhD (PI), who is an expert in shape-memory polymers and device testing; Ken Gall PhD, a full professor from Georgia Tech who specializes in shape-memory materials and medical device testing; and Reed Bartz MD, an orthopedic surgeon and expert in arthroscopic shoulder repair. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A growing percentage of the population is remaining physically active as they age. This project is relevant to this percentage of people that experience a debilitating injury such as a rotator cuff tear and suffer from poor bone quality. This project will provide a means to restore function to repaired injury sites with less occurrence of surgical failure and increase patient quality of life.",

In Phase 1, we achieved supercontinuum output to 5.8 microns in tellurite glass fibers setting a record for mid-IR supercontinuum generation. Further improvements into the mid-infrared region (meaning 6 to 12 microns) would enable a plethora of new opportunities including high-resolution infrared microscopy, remote sensing (standoff detection), and IR countermeasures. Indeed, because of the stability of our supercontinuum source, entirely new applications such as mid-IR frequency combs could be developed.

Early detection of cancer is a critical factor for the successful treatment of cancer patients. The discovery of specific autoantibody signatures in cancer patients has led to the recognition that autoantibody responses may have diagnostic potential. The lack of high throughput methods for rapidly screening and validating multiple antigens of interest has been identified as an important bottleneck for the development of autoantibodies as biomarkers for cancer diagnosis. We will test normal and cancer patient sera against protein arrays generated using a gene library expressing human full-length proteins. Autoantibodies against the proteins in these arrays will be identified using electrochemiluminescence (ECL) detection technology, a proven technology for high throughput array-based measurements that will enable studies with large numbers of patient samples. Our approach will offer key advantages over existing array-based approaches by providing a high throughput, sensitive and specific assay platform. This approach will also facilitate the rapid transition from discovery of antigens using large arrays to clinical validation of the hits using small focused arrays on the same diagnostic platform. In the Phase I portion of the proposed project, we will demonstrate technical feasibility of the approach; in the Phase II portion we will develop and validate the proteome-scale arrays, and use them to screen cancer serum samples to identify a promising subset of autoantigens; the selected subset will then be further tested with a large number of individual samples.",

        "abstract": "The widespread use of synthetic plastics has increased concerns over their adverse environmental impacts, and dramatic fluctuations in the cost and availability of petrochemical sources for plastic production creates the need for renewable, environmentally-friendly plastics derived from agricultural sources. Blow molded products are used widely in packaging, and are a major component of the plastics manufacturing industry that are suitable for replacement by biobased materials. This project will demonstrate the use of Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs), a family of bioplastics made by the biological conversion of agricultural feedstocks, in commercial-scale blow molding manufacturing operations. Advances in PHA formulation and processing technology developed in Phase 1 of the project demonstrated the feasibility of blow molding PHAs at the lab-scale. In this program, PHA formulations will be improved with the necessary melt strength and crystallization behavior for blow molding operations using existing equipment at current production fficiencies, while providing the key physical properties needed in the blow molded part. Once satisfactory formulations are developed, pilot blow molding trials will be conducted to confirm proper rheological behavior of the PHA formulations and physical properties of the molded part. Metabolix will then demonstrate blow molding on commercial scale equipment running at typical manufacturing speeds.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is directed toward fulfilling the need of business and Government organizations to more effectively monitor and protect their electronic networks. Network security devices (NSDs) such as Anti-virus, Intrusion Detection/Prevention, spam/phishing filtering, and bandwidth anomaly detection systems have become an integral part of our networks as they provide invaluable services in maintaining data integrity and confidentiality, while protecting the availability of computing resources. This research aims at significantly increasing the timeliness, accuracy and cost-effectiveness of NSDs in combating fast-changing and ever-more sophisticated network security attacks.  The programming and maintenance of NSDs is today a very significant obstacle to their wider adoption. The most common and significant complaints of existing NSDs users are (1) excessive amounts of false positive events (events that should not be generated) and the difficulty in analyzing security events (2) their extreme sensitivity to the timeliness of the security updates to catch emerging threats and (3) the expertise required in the installation, maintenance and operation of these systems. These obstacles limit adoption by many smaller companies that cannot afford to hire expert system administrators and network security analysts. MetaFlows seeks to capitalize on these deficiencies by providing ways to outsource this complexity. If successful, this research effort will inexpensively and thoroughly improve the manageability, accuracy and return on investment of many existing NSDs.",

Although geographically extensive and relatively accurate, this system does not adequately detect low-yield nuclear detonations, and there is a delay in information dissemination.  This project will develop a low-cost miniature seismometer based on the latest developments in micro-opto-electromechanical systems technology.  The seismometer will be capable of detecting accelerations as small as 1 nano-g, with a dynamic range of 120 dB.  In addition, it will be rugged, rapidly-deployable, and capable of unattended operation and interrogation in real time.  During Phase I, a prototype instrument was designed and proof-of-principle was established analytically and experimentally.  In Phase II, the seismometer will be fabricated and demonstrated, based on the Phase I design.  A manufacturing study will be conducted to advance the prototype to a production-quality design. Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  In addition to making the assessment of nuclear detonations available immediately, the new seismometer should find use in a broad range of activities including geological research (mining and oil prospecting), earth sciences (early warning for earthquakes, volcanoes, and tsunamis), space exploration (satellite drag measurements, docking, navigation), homeland security (footstep detection, tampering, entry, and illicit activities), and building and vehicle safety.",

An example of an often-cited \u00bfideal situation\u00bf is one where renewable energy sources, such as solar or wind, generate electricity that can then either be stored in electric vehicle batteries for transportation or in battery energy storage systems for off-grid energy and power management.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of the proposed SBIR Phase-II Competing Renewal under RFA-EY-09-001 is to develop inexpensive and compact ophthalmic instruments for rapid diabetic retinopathy (DR) detection and screening. To achieve the program objective, the key aims will be to [1] generate functional swept-source optical coherence tomography (F-SS-OCT) system at 1060nm spectral region to perform early detection of DR by imaging retinal layers and choroidal microvasculature at video rates, [2] to develop effective image analysis methods to speed screening, and [3] to conduct human clinical trials with the goal to extract the defining DR disease signature. The final F-SS-OCT engine will be a compact, turn-key device that can greatly facilitate integration into a system integrator's ophthalmic imaging instrument for use by primary-care physicians as well as medical professionals at easily accessible public locales and retail stores. The ultimate benefit of this work is to create an affordable and enabling technology to provide both morphological and blood flow information for the diagnosis and management of diabetic retinopathy. Supported by the combined advantages of deep light penetration, minimal tissue dispersion, higher safe light exposure, high sensitivity, resolution, and speed, the 1060nm F-SS-OCT technology should enable superior imaging for DR. Current retinal OCT systems use light sources centered at 820nm for clear intraretinal layer imaging but have insufficient penetration depth for imaging the choroidal microvasculature. The choroid plays an important role in many ocular diseases including DR. Imaging and quantifying choroidal blood flow with F-SS-OCT would provide valuable information in both diagnosing and managing these ocular diseases at earlier stages. Based on the research accomplished in the current Phase-II NEI-SBIR, this renewal program is well positioned to greatly facilitate the commercialization of functional OCT imaging system by extending beyond the current swept laser technology to encompass a fully self-contained F-SS-OCT engine. Therefore, this program will focus on advancing the novel swept laser technology, developing the OCT engine, performing functional OCT imaging tests, conducting human clinical trials, and developing and verifying image analysis methods for rapid DR screening. New product manufacturing process will also be initiated to ensure successful commercialization.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The objective of the program is to develop inexpensive and compact swept source optical coherence tomography engine at 1060nm spectral region for rapid diabetic retinopathy (DR) detection and screening. DR is a significant complication of diabetes and is the third leading cause of blindness in the US.; furthermore, DR remains the leading cause of new blindness in working aged people in the  Western World . Generating real-time measurements of blood flow and correlating the findings with tissue morphology in normal and diseased eyes is a novel and powerful approach to understanding the disease-related abnormalities in the retina. The final engine will be a compact, turn-key device that can greatly facilitate integration into a system integrator's ophthalmic imaging instrument for use by primary-care physicians as well as medical professionals at easily accessible public locales and retail stores. The ultimate benefit of this work is to create an affordable and enabling technology to provide both morphological and blood flow information for the diagnosis and management of diabetic retinopathy.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Micronics' goal is to develop a first-of-its-kind, low cost qualitative PCR assay for HIV RNA detection that is automated within a closed system, disposable device in turn processed by a portable instrument; the system will allow specimen in / result out processing at near patient point of care and in low resource settings. Since the late 1980s, national guidelines to confirm HIV-1 infection dictate the use of Western blot (WB) and indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) for diagnosis1. However, nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) may identify some infections earlier; reduce testing costs; permit HIV-2 and broader HIV-1 subtype detection; reduce provision of false-positive, false-negative, and indeterminate test results. NAAT is currently not recommended for screening since it is much more expensive and involves complex methodology. However, a low cost, rapid NAAT test at point of care would be useful in Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI) clinics or emergency rooms (where patients often do not return for tests results) or on labor and delivery wards for high risk pregnant women who have not previously been tested. More frequent screening in all health care settings could increase the proportion of HIV-infected clients who learn their results and who could be linked to appropriate care. The intent is to sell this device at substantially reduced costs compared to the  45 to  75 current NAAT tests cost. The assay strategy is as follows : RNA is extracted from a whole blood finger or heel stick (20-50 microliter) specimen using fluidic and valve logic within a tooled cartridge device and the eluted nucleic acid introduced directly into microchannels for cDNA synthesis. The cDNA is fluidically transferred to a second set of microchannels to rehydrate a dried PCR master mix. PCR is rapidly performed within the microchannels in under 20-30 minutes. The amplified product is fluorescently tagged by a FRET method and a positive result detected optically at the end of 40 thermal cycles. Successful completion of the phase II milestones of 50 copy HIV detection following processing on a prototype totally integrated cartridge as run on a Micronics prototype base device initially for spiked blood specimens and then for retrospective positive HIV-1 specimens will develop the system through pre-clinical evaluations to a stage ready for follow-up clinical evaluations to generate data for FDA approval. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: NARRATIVE In order to better identify and counsel persons with unrecognized HIV infection and link them to clinical and prevention services as well as further reduce perinatal transmission of HIV in the United States, the CDC has recommended expanded screening. The most sensitive screening method is based upon detection of the nucleic acid testing but this approach is currently expensive and performed in reference laboratories. We propose the miniaturization and automation of nucleic acid testing methods to enable low cost, near patient testing.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart failure is the number one cause of death in the United States and presents an increasing public burden of morbidity and mortality even as the mortality from coronary artery disease and hypertension is decreasing. While an estimated 40,000 congestive heart failure patients are candidates for heart transplantation, only 2,200 donor hearts are made available each year highlighting the need for mechanical circulatory support. In its efforts to develop new treatments of cardiovascular diseases, the NIH NHLBI has funded development of pulsatile and nonpulsatile mechanical circulatory assist devices (MCADs). While, current use of MCADs is increasing, many more patients would benefit if fully implantable and wearable devices with physiologic control systems were available. MiTi's ultimate goal is an implantable rotary Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD) with physiologic controller for destination therapy in adult heart failure patients. Key and novel features of the proposed self sensing physiologic controller are its ability to use motor and magnetic bearing signals to adjust LVAD output in response to cardiac output changes through the use of differential pressure and flow estimators all while avoiding suction. The specific goals of this project are to design, implement and demonstrate physiologic control of the MiTiHeart(R) LVAD output through computer simulations, in vitro and in vivo tests. Specifically, MiTi(R)'s Mock Circulator System (MCS) will be modified to more accurately model left ventricle hemodynamics, the physiologic control algorithms having differential pressure, flow and suction avoidance objective functions will be implemented in the MiTiHeart(R) LVAD controller and evaluated in the MCS. Electric analog computer simulations of the MCS and LVAD will be updated and tuned to match the measured data so that evaluations of additional control algorithms and system physical changes can be simulated including replacing the MCS model with a human cardiovascular system model. Finally, in vivo acute animal studies will be completed at Penn State Hershey Medical Center to demonstrate the ability of the physiologic controller to adjust LVAD output without entering suction. The following Specific Aims are planned: (1) Design and implement modifications to the MiTi(R) MCS to more accurately model left ventricle hemodynamics by incorporating improved simulation of left ventricle (LV) ejection flow and pressure. (2) Modify the mathematical model of the MCS developed in Phase I to accept an enhanced LVAD performance model including the physiologic control algorithm. Tune the integrated mathematical model to reflect the measured performance in the MCS. Use the optimized model to assess the ability of the LVAD and controller to respond to simulated changes first in the MCS model and then with a human cardiovascular system (CVS) model. Simulations with both MCS and CVS models will then be performed using the enhanced models to assess performance of the LVAD and physiologic control system under a wide variety of conditions to verify the ability of the controller to vary output with changing physiologic demand while also avoiding suction. (3) Evaluate the physiologic control system performance, suction avoidance and pump differential pressure and flow estimations via in vitro testing in the updated MCS. The physiologic control algorithms and architecture developed under Phase I will be implemented in a dSpace digital control hardware system. The control system will then be used with the MiTiHeart LVAD to characterize and verify the proposed control system in the updated MCS. MCS testing under different simulated heart conditions that encourage suction events will be conducted. (4) Conduct three in vivo acute animal studies to validate performance of the physiologic controller including estimating differential pressure and flow as well as detecting and avoiding suction where the animal heart CO will be pharmacologically modified. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: According to the American Heart Association [1], approximately one million Americans die each year from heart disease and almost 4.7 million Americans have congestive heart failure (CHF), a chronic condition in which at least one chamber of the heart is not pumping well enough to meet the body's need. With more than half a million new cases of CHF and only 2,200 donor hearts available for almost 40,000 heart transplantation candidates every year, there is a pressing need for new treatment options such as mechanical circulatory assist devices or heart assist pumps [2]. The success of early developments has resulted in the use of circulatory assistance for short durations [2, 3, 4], however new developments are needed to make long duration use of these heart assist devices possible.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ultimate goal of this Fast Track Phase I/II SBIR proposal is to develop the novel pharmaceutical agent 131I-MIP-1145, as a molecular targeting radio-therapeutic treatment for metastatic melanoma. Preliminary results with the former lead compound were highly successful in animal tumor models and human melanoma patients. During purity testing for animal safety studies, radiolysis induced degradation at high radioactive concentrations prohibited development of the first generation compound. Chemical and preclinical evaluation identified the compound MIP-1145 to have greater chemical stability with more desirable distribution properties in animals. 131I-MIP-1145 is a radio-iodinated benzamide molecule with extremely high selective binding to melanin expressing melanomas with prolonged retention and low non-target organ accumulation. The molecular target specificity and high tumor accumulation of 131I-MIP-1145 are ideal properties for an agent to effectively treat melanoma metastasis. Preliminary preclinical efficacy studies demonstrated complete tumor remission after two treatments with 131I-MIP-1145 in a SK-Mel-3 human melanoma xenograft mouse model. The first six month phase of this proposal will focus on developing a stable formulation for large doses (150 mCi) of high specific activity 131I-MIP-1145. The formulation composition must be firmly established prior to conducting extensive pre-clinical safety and efficacy studies. The second phase of the proposal will focus on developing a continuous flow production process that will be validated on an automated laboratory synthesis system, to reduce radiation exposure to personnel and provide sufficient levels of activity for therapeutic clinical trials. To produce material for human testing, a GMP production campaign for the critical component precursor and reference standard must be initiated. Radioactive 131I-MIP-1145 material from pre-validation productions will also be used to perform animal safety and toxicity testing. The data on process development chemistry, manufacturing and controls, analytical testing, chemical stability as well as pre-clinical toxicity studies will be the backbone of an application to the FDA. The justification for requesting Fast Track consideration is to have the therapeutic scale production batch ready to treat patients as soon as the imaging / dosimetry study is performed in human melanoma patients. The innovation in this proposal is the exciting promise for a potential curative therapeutic treatment of metastatic melanoma. Following successful completion of the SBIR program, Molecular Insight will develop a clinical protocol for an industry sponsored IND application to the FDA.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abstract There is presently no effective therapy for relapsing, metastatic, androgen-independent prostate cancer and the most effective treatment occurs with early and appropriate intervention. Blood PSA screening and digital rectal exams can detect early warning signs of prostate cancer but an effective tissue-specific method for spatial localization of metastatic disease is not available. Human prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is an integral trans-membrane protein, associated with the prostate epithelium, prostatic tumor cells and the neovasculature of other tumor types. PSMA is a 750 amino acid type II glycoprotein which is typically expressed to a small extent in normal human prostate epithelium but is up-regulated in prostate cancer, including metastatic disease. The extracellular portion of PSMA is highly homologous to the enzyme NAALDase (N-acetylated a-linked acidic dipeptidase) which is involved in the deactivation of neuronal signaling peptides. The enzymatic aspect of PSMA is a unique exopeptidase with reactivity toward poly-gamma-glutamated folates, capable of sequentially removing the poly-gamma-glutamyl termini. Since PSMA is expressed by virtually all prostate cancers and especially poorly differentiated, metastatic and hormone-refractory carcinomas, it is a very attractive target for prostate imaging and therapy. A range of PSMA inhibitors have been reported that may serve as platforms for the development of agents targeted to PSMA enzymatic activity. In a successfully completed phase 1 SBIR award (1R43EB004253), Molecular Insight has developed novel radiolabeled inhibitors that interact with PSMA and may provide specific targeting for the detection, treatment and management of prostate cancer. Two of the most active compounds, from in vitro PSMA cell binding assays and normal rat in vivo distribution studies, were tested for acute toxicity in rats and an exploratory IND filed to evaluate them as metastatic prostate cancer imaging agent in humans. Seven patients with confirmed metastatic prostate cancer were compared with two similar I-123 labeled compounds. Exceptional tumor accumulation was observed by both compounds in previously identified prostate metastasis along with localization of previously unknown disease. As required by the FDA, the exploratory IND must be closed and the results presented to the agency before proceeding to more elaborate traditional testing. Subsequently, the sponsor must fulfill all the safety assessments and CMC developments required for a conventional IND to proceed to human efficacy testing. The short physical half life of the Iodine-123 (13 hours) necessitates GMP production for each study and preliminary studies are only performed of small quantities due to radiation protection safeguards, consequently scale up production is required to produce multiple doses. Additionally as an agent progresses down the clinical development pathway more scrutiny is applied further up the chain of components for the drug product. The ultimate goal of this phase 2 SBIR application is to initiate the GMP campaign for the critical component drug precursor, perform CMC optimization and scale up of the final drug product, initiate metabolite studies and complete the preclinical safety testing require to initiate a conventional IND. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Determination of serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) is an effective early screen for potential prostate cancer with revenues estimated at over 350 million annually. Although the current screening method of PSA levels in the blood is valuable for early detection, the confirmation by fine needle biopsy does not give a representative evaluation of the entire prostate or determine lymph node involvement. A reliable method for non-invasive diagnosis and monitoring of primary and metastatic tumors would be an important addition to the management of prostate cancer victims. New Prostrate Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) targeted to the extracellular domain of this protein represents a potential new class of drugs for the diagnosis, management or treatment of prostate cancer and embody a significant commercial opportunity in an area of unmet clinical need. There is presently no effective therapy for relapsing, metastatic, androgen-independent prostate cancer or a tissue specific method to spatially locate disease. In a successfully completed phase 1 SBIR award (1R43EB004253), Molecular Insight has developed novel inhibitors that interact with PSMA and may provide specific targeting for the detection, treatment and management of prostate cancer. Seven patients have been compared with two I-123 labeled compounds in an exploratory IND and both compounds exhibit exceptional tumor accumulation and rapid whole body elimination. The lead compound will be entered into additional safety assessments required for a conventional clinical trial and proceed to dose finding, human safety and efficacy testing. The ultimate goal of this phase 2 SBIR application is to initiate the GMP campaign for the drug precursor, perform CMC optimization and scale up of the final drug product and complete the preclinical safety testing require to initiate a traditional clinical trial.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV infection is still a serious public health problem with young people (14-18 year olds) in the U.S. Evidence- based curricula to reduce unprotected sexual risk-taking behaviors among youth have grown in availability and demand over the past 25 years. One of the most popular and nationally recognized of these curricula is Reducing the Risk (RTR). RTR is a 16-lesson, classroom-based curriculum that has been shown, in multiple controlled trials, to delay the onset of intercourse and reduce the rate of unprotected sex with high school age youth. Changing these behaviors is key to reducing the incidence of unintended teen pregnancy and transmission of HIV and STDs. Educators need skills-based training because research shows that curricula are more likely to be taught with fidelity and replicate positive student outcomes if educators are prepared and have the knowledge, skill, motivation and support to implement the curricula with fidelity (Ringwalt et al., 2003). Despite the known positive effects of skills-based training on implementation quality and fidelity, educators frequently do not or cannot acquire the training they need. Face-to-face trainings are extremely limited because they are time consuming to arrange, expensive to conduct, and often difficult to attend. Nor do they provide ongoing implementation support. The proposed Phase II SBIR will develop and rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of the online training and support system, RTRWorks , to prepare school-based educators to implement RTR with fidelity. To test the effectiveness of RTRWorks , we will conduct a pre-test/post-test randomized controlled trial, randomizing at the educator level to one of two arms: 1) the online training intervention arm; and 2) the community standard (self preparation) control arm. We will recruit 230 educators from across the U.S. to participate, with 115 teachers in each arm. RTRWorks  will provide a new online training model. If this model proves to be effective, it can be applied and adapted to other evidence-based intervention curricula across the full spectrum of content areas including adolescent sexual behavior, obesity prevention, and substance abuse prevention. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: HIV infection is still a serious public health problem with young people (14-18 year olds) in the U.S. During the past 25 years, significant progress has been made in developing evidence-based programs designed to prevent HIV and unintended pregnancy in adolescents. Given the recent failure of other promising prevention initiatives (e.g. vaccine trials and microbicides) the importance of effective dissemination and implementation of these evidence-based programs becomes even more critical. However, despite the known positive effects of skills-based training on implementation quality and fidelity, educators frequently do not or cannot acquire the training they need on these programs due to time, monetary or other barriers. The proposed online training program and support system, RTRWorks  will prepare school-based educators to implement RTR, a nationally recognized evidence-based program, with fidelity. If this model proves to be effective, the online skills-based training developed under this grant will provide an accessible, low-cost,  always-on  training and implementation support service.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop and demonstrate a prototype Hypoxia Perfusion Bioreactor (HPB). In order to utilize recent discoveries that low oxygen levels are favorable to stem cell expansion, Resodyn Corporation has developed the HPB, which is designed to provide controlled delivery of both oxygen and fresh medium to stem cell cultures. Studying and controlling the physical parameters are essential in order to bring reproducible, economically feasible therapies to the clinic. One goal of this Phase II proposal is to evaluate and demonstrate the utility and commercial feasibility of Resodyn Corporation's Hypoxia Perfusion Bioreactor (HPB) for wide range of hematopoietic cell expansion applications. A second goal is to develop a model protocol that will demonstrate the HPB's ability to expand hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) without the requirement for previous selection (CD34+ or AC133+) for primitive stem cell populations. This capability would represent a significant advance in reducing the cost and complexity of therapeutic and research efforts in the stem cell field. While the primary feasibility of the HPB will be tested primarily with hematopoietic cell populations, the benefits of this device (controlled hypoxia/oxygen levels, high cell densities, reduced labor, lower contamination risk) would have extended utility to other types of stem and progenitor cells (mesenchymal, adipose, neural, etc.), as well as for use in general mammalian cell culture. Such applications include hybridoma culture for monoclonal antibody (MAb) production and Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell culture for production of recombinant proteins. The HPB system has significant long-term commercial potential both in the laboratory as a tool to facilitate development of stem cells protocols, and in the clinic as a component of both hematopoietic transplantation and other pre-emerging stem cell therapies of the neural, hematopoietic, and mesenchymal lineages. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop and demonstrate a Hypoxia Perfusion Bioreactor (HPB). The HPB is a single-use bioreactor designed specifically for stem cell and other primary cell cultures and can substantially reduce labor costs and reduce contamination risks associated with the scale-up of cellular therapies. The HPB will reduce costs and ease the translation of stem cell therapies from the research lab to the clinic.",

ResonantAcoustics(R) is a low-frequency acoustic mixing technology that is non-invasive and highly effective for mixing and gas transfer. The RBS will be developed as a higher- performing alternative to conventional orbital shakers that will allow the use of multiple agitation speeds simultaneously. Conventional biological orbital shakers have substantial drawbacks that include low oxygen transfer capability and are limited to one agitation speed at a time. Acoustic agitation brings increased levels of micro mixing that translate to increases in product expression from bacteria and fungi. The RBS will also allow new levels of control over the morphological profile of fungal cultures, which is of major scientific interest and industrially relevance. During the course of project, a new type of closure will be designed in order to take full advantage of the enhanced acoustic mixing. Custom single-use flask designs optimized for the RBS will be developed. Advanced operational strategies (agitation intensity, volume level, real-time oxygen monitoring) will be explored to provide guidance on the best conditions at which to operate different types of microbial cultures. Performance of the RBS will be compared to orbital shakers for bacterial, fungal, and yeast cell cultures. Through its ability to support dramatically increased levels of biomass and operate at multiple settings simultaneously, the RBS will significantly expand both the pace and productivity of work in microbiological research.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Health and behavioral cancer researchers require highly reliable, objective, and methodologically founded measurement instruments, accurate scaling of subjects on important health-related attributes, and statistically sound procedures for evaluating differences among groups (such as treatment vs control) and change across time. Item response theory (IRT) provides a powerful modeling framework for achieving these goals via the measurement of latent attributes that are only indirectly measured by observable data. Unfortunately, there is a massive lack of user-friendly IRT software that allows for a straightforward computation of a variety of IRT models in daily research applications. The aim of this project is the development of flexible, user-friendly IRT software especially suited for researchers in the health sciences. This software will run on multiple platforms and cover a broad spectrum of IRT models such as classical binary models (Rasch, 1-PL, 2-PL, 3-PL), classical polytomous models (GRM, RSM, PCM, NRM), as well as up-to-date approaches such as models with covariates (mixed-effects models) and multidimensional models that are highly relevant for health related research questions. The generalized models enable analysis of longitudinal and multilevel data, as well as examination of treatment group effects on a scale. Multidimensional models overcome the sometimes rather restrictive assumptions that require analysis of only one attribute at a time. From a technical point of view, the program will offer numerous statistical estimation approaches for item and person parameters such as MML, nonparametric MML, fully nonparametric models, MCMC, Bayesian EAP, weighted likelihood, etc. Once the parameters are estimated, a researcher can evaluate the model by means of a large set of model tests and fit indices. Numerous interactive high- level plots will allow for a customizable visualization of the results, and an XML export will assure that tables and figures are publication quality. A special emphasis in terms of user-friendliness is the use of a JAVA based graphical user interface (GUI) that will be consistent across a variety of computing platforms. Throughout the IRT modeling workflow, a researcher will be supported by context-sensitive dialog boxes. Experienced IRT scholars will have the option to refine their models using an intuitive IRT command language. The software package will be supported by a comprehensive online platform (Wiki) including technical explanations, a user's guide, model and data examples, a news section, a discussion board, a FAQ section, and other features.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Duchenne Muscular Dystrophic (DMD) is a fatal genetic disease affecting tens of thousands of boys in the U.S. There is currently no cure for the disease and few drugs are available to slow the progressive loss in skeletal muscle strength. Glucocorticoids such as prednisone are one of the few classes of drugs in clinical use in DMD to slow the loss of muscle function, but have serious adverse side effects when used chronically. There is thus a great need to identify new compounds that can improve the longevity and quality of life of the boys with this devastating disease. Myomics has developed a phenotypic high content drug screening technology termed MyoForce Analysis System (MFASTM). It is comprised of tissue engineered skeletal muscle (Miniature BioArtificial Muscles or mBAMs) attached to micro-mechanical sensors in ninety-six microwell plates to quantitatively measure muscle contractile forces. These three-dimensional contractile tissues are composed of organized striated skeletal muscle fibers that generate directed force when electrically stimulated. Myomics' mBAM tissue/sensor composite is capable of repetitive nondestructive force measurements over days to weeks. Such long-term studies can determine cumulative effects of drugs on tissues and provides physiological data regarding tissue function. The physiological measurement of force generation by mBAMs is not limited to any particular known biochemical pathway, but rather the measurement of force is the result of both positive and negative drug effects. Thus, MFASTM will not only screen compounds for positive muscle strength effects through known as well as unknown pathways, but will more rapidly eliminate target compounds with potentially adverse side effects. In Myomics' Phase I SBIR project mBAMs were tissue engineered from conditionally immortalized myoblasts from the mdx mouse, the small animal model of DMD. These dystrophin negative mBAMs generated measureable tetanic forces that increased significantly when incubated with nine compounds that improve muscle strength in vivo. MFASTM was thus validated as a screen for new drugs to treat muscle weakness in DMD and will serve as an important bridge between target-based high throughput drug screening and follow-on in vivo animal studies; it provides a rapid and cost effective screen compared to in vivo testing. The purpose of this Phase II project is to (1) Screen commercially available banks of clinically tested small molecules (600-1200) for increased skeletal muscle strength; and (2) Determine whether compounds identified in (1) synergistically improve the benefits of glucocorticoid treatment. This SBIR Phase II project falls within several aspects of the NIH ROADMAP FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH including the use of innovative phenotypic drug screening instrumentation to better understand the metabolic components and networks within tissues, creating new models to help predict the body's response to disease treatment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Duchene muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a genetically inherited fatal skeletal muscle disease with few treatments currently available for slowing the loss of muscle strength. Myomics' high content drug screening technology is aimed at identifying new drug candidates to attenuate skeletal muscle loss and thereby increase muscle strength. While not a cure for the disease, these new drug therapies are aimed at enhancing quality and longevity of life of the DMD patient.",

Specifically, extensive fragmentation can interfere with the analysis of lipids, peptides and pharmaceuticals in the low mass region (m/z < 500), and organic matrices tend to form large crystals upon drying which can limit imaging resolution and repeatability. NanoComposix is developing a new matrix that utilizes gold nanoparticles to efficiently ionize biomolecules from tissue samples. This gold nanoparticle matrix has much lower background ion signal, has improved imaging resolution, and specifically ionizes molecules not observed using traditional organic matrices. MALDI-IMS will be used to validate optimized nanoparticle formulations and application methods using hepatic and neuronal tissue slices.  The broader impacts of this research are the potential for profound affects on the scientific communities understanding of disease, capabilities for early disease diagnosis, and our ability to find new drug targets. Information on the content and spatial distribution of biomarkers in tissue will accelerate the development of ?personalized medicine? where drugs can be selected based on individual patient characteristics. The current organic matrices used for MALDI-IMS are limited and there is an immediate need for new matrices with unique specificity and sensitivity towards biomarkers that are not observed using standard matrices.",

The key to producing these capacitors is through improvements in the capacitor dielectric.  Properties such as dielectric strength, temperature stability, and dielectric constant need to be improved over tradition materials.  This project will investigate the use of flexible amorphous hafnium dioxide films as a dielectric.  Amorphous oxides can have a dielectric constant >25 and breakdown strength in excess of 400 V/micron, and, due to their flexibility, they can be rolled into various compact shapes.  These properties make them ideal for improving the temperature stability, durability, and weight of the high voltage bus capacitors found in electric vehicles.  In Phase I, amorphous HfO2 dielectric films were deposited on glass and polyimide substrates and tested to demonstrate that HfO2 is an ideal dielectric for the fabrication of high capacitance wound capacitors. Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Development of an improved dielectric material for capacitors would allow development of a new generation of compact, high-voltage, temperature-stable capacitors that would have many applications, both in commercial and military markets.  In particular, these capacitors should find use as bus capacitors in electric vehicles.  Temperature tolerant capacitors also could be used in conjunction with wide bandgap materials for the next generation of high temperature electronics",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This SBIR Phase II program aims to develop a novel class of commercial products of near infrared (NIR) nanolabels based on colloidal non-cadmium quantum dots, InAs/InP/ZnSe core/shell/shell dots coated with dendron ligands. NIR emitters are outstanding bio-medical labels because of the close-to-zero background of biological tissues in the NIR window. The traditional organic dyes are very inefficient (single digit in percentage of quantum yield) and unstable. Most NIR bio-medical labels based on quantum dots reported in literature today are based on cadmium, mercury, or lead elements, which are extremely toxic and unlikely to make into the real life applications because of the tightened environmental policies. InAs based core/shell nanocrystals are considered as the most promising NIR nanolabels if the shell materials don't contain Cd, Hg and Pb elements involved. Unlike zero tolerance of Cd, Hg and Pb in today's regulation environment in advanced countries, human body can tolerate a small amount of indium, arsenic and selenium. During the Phase I program, this SBIR team finally overcame the main scientific hurdles for realizing such a promising system, i.e., InAs/InP/ZnSe core/shell/shell dots, as NIR nanolabels. The system demonstrated by us is not only non- cadmium in nature, but also of high brightness (~50% quantum yield), small in hydrodynamic sizes (lt10 nm), stable in tested physiological conditions (such as full serum), and no appreciable specific bonding. The Phase II program shall develop these outstanding nanolabels for the market of general bio-medical labeling. In the following Phase III, this SBIR team shall further develop these unique NIR labels to several specific medical fields. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The success of this project will result in great benefits to the society and communities as follows: The ultra-sensitivity based on zero background NIR detection can in vivo diagnose and monitor cancer or other diseases in early stage, even to the resolution of single cell level. The simultaneous reading capability of multiple labels makes them be capable of addressing the biological and evolutionary diversity of the multiple cancer cells that make up a tumor within an individual. The commercialization of the proposed technologies will improve the health conditions of Americans, save lives, and help to maintain a sustainable environment.",

        "abstract": "The formation of a condensate film on the surface of a heat exchanger tube reduces the heat transfer coefficient of vapor-to-liquid heat exchangers.  This reduction occurs because the thermal conductivity of the condensate liquid is only a fraction of that of the metallic heat exchanging tube material, thereby lowering the overall thermal conductivity.  This situation can be overcome if the vapor condensation occurred in the form of droplets, instead of a continuous film.  However, to date, it has remained a challenge to promote \"dropwise\" condensation in practical heat exchangers.  This project will develop surface treatment techniques that can lead to superhydrophobicity, resulting in durable dropwise condensation on heat exchanger tubes.  In Phase I, two surface treatment techniques were demonstrated, and both led to superhydrophobic surfaces and a dramatic enhancement of the heat transfer rate due to the formation of dropwise condensation.  Further, these surfaces maintained dropwise condensation in a high temperature steam environment and exhibited superior durability compared to traditional hydrophobic coatings.  Phase II will (1) optimize the superhydrophobic surface treatments; (2) develop variations of the surface treatments for organic systems used in geothermal and solar thermal applications; (3) conduct performance testing of superhydrophobic surface treatments in a test heat exchanger under simulated use conditions; and (4) develop a predictive model for dropwise condensation heat transfer in a multi-tube practical heat exchanger. Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The development of a durable superhydrophobic surface treatment for heat exchangers should lead to lower electricity costs due to improved heat transfer efficiency and reduced power generation.  Superhydrophobic surfaces also should find applications in water-repellant textiles, anti-fouling and anti-corrosion coatings, fluidic drag reduction, oil-water separation, and biomaterials",

However, existing solid electrolytes based on poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) do not meet the functional performance requirements.  At low temperatures, the conductivity is poor due to the presence of crystalline PEO segments, which restrict lithium ion mobility.  This restriction limits the useful operating temperature of Li-ion polymer batteries to between 70oC and 100oC, which excludes the use of solid polymer based batteries in room temperature commercial applications.  This project will investigate the use of a novel nanocomposite organic/inorganic hybrid material as a potential solid polymer electrolyte system that can exhibit high Li-ion conductivity at room temperature and below, along with good mechanical properties.  The presence of inorganic moieties in the material will inhibit the crystallization of PEO chains, leading to increased low temperature ionic conductivity and an increased lithium transference number.  Phase I involved the synthesis of a composite material in which the PEO component remained amorphous, resulting in an order-of-magnitude higher Li-ion conductivity at room temperature and below, and almost twice the lithium transference number compared to conventional PEO/Li-salt membranes.  In Phase II, the structure of the new material will be optimized, electrolyte membranes will be produced via an economical processing method, and both Li-metal and Li-ion cells will be fabricated and tested.   Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Although rechargeable lithium-ion batteries are ubiquitous in the commercial marketplace, existing Li-ion batteries contain flammable liquid electrolytes, which compromises safety.

With conventional coating technologies, repair of a coating is tedious and expensive.  The use of self-healing coatings \u00bf i.e., coatings that possess an intrinsic ability to heal damage \u00bf can prolong the operational life of coatings and reduce the frequency of full coating replacement.  This project will develop a generic platform technology that can repair not only minor surface scratches but also deep cracks, via a simultaneous crack closing and sealing process.  The approach involves the use of a polymer composite coating that has a unique morphology at an ultrafine scale.  In Phase I, a new self-healing polyurethane-based coating formulation, and a method of producing the same, was developed.  The self-healing of surface scratches, as well as deep and narrow razor blade cracks, was demonstrated.  In addition, the coating\u00bfs high gloss was maintained after the self-healing of the crack or scratch occurred.  Phase II will optimize the self-healing polyurethane nanocomposite system and implement the platform technology in various polymer matrices for different commercial applications.

However, large scale use of magnesium is prevented due to its high propensity to corrode.  In particular, galvanic corrosion is a severe problem when magnesium is used in the exterior sub-assemblies of automobiles.  Hence, there is an unmet need for advanced protective coatings to protect magnesium from general and galvanic corrosion.  Current non-chromate pretreatments and powder coats are not effective because defects form in the coating and expose the bare metal.  This project will develop a self-healing waterborne pretreatment and a self-healing powder coat that will provide damage-responsive corrosion protection to magnesium.  In Phase I, the pretreatment and powder coats, which contained a dispersion of corrosion inhibitor particles, were synthesized and deposited on AZ91D substrates.  Accelerated corrosion and electrochemical tests demonstrated (1) the beneficial attributes of the nanoscale additive in the pretreatment, and (2) the ability of inhibitor particles in the powder coat to form a passivating film.  Phase II will optimize the pretreatment and powder coat chemistries, determine the mechanism of corrosion inhibition by the particles dispersed in the coatings, and perform galvanic and general corrosion tests on magnesium test coupons in laboratory and field environments. Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The self-healing coatings should significantly increase the use of magnesium-based components in automobiles.  Magnesium-based components in the chassis and powertrain could reduce the weight of a car by up to 10 %, thereby increasing its fuel efficiency.

This project will develop a new class of nanoparticle-based sorbents wherein the reaction sites are highly accessible to mercury ions, thereby providing efficient and fast removal.  In Phase I, nanoparticle-based sorbents were produced and tested for reaction kinetics and sorption capacity for mercury removal.  Preliminary results showed that the sorbent performed significantly better than commercially available sorbents in terms of both reaction kinetics and loading capacity.

It is for the existing Phase II SBIR grant  Molecular Mammography of Her-2 Cancers using Gold Nanoparticles , R44CA124190.  Cancer imaging is important for tumor detection, determination of prognosis and treatments, image guided surgery and irradiation, as well as for monitoring responses. Molecular imaging of specific targets could identify tumor types and enable selection of appropriate drugs. Although mammography is widely used and more rapid and with higher resolution compared to PET, SPECT, and MRI, there are currently no targeted mammography contrast agents. In this currently funded grant, we are developing molecular targeted agents for mammography and CT by a nanotechnology approach using gold nanoparticle conjugates for imaging breast cancers. Her 2/neu protein is being targeted by use of antibodies attached to biocompatible gold nanoparticles using a mouse model. This would then be useful for non-invasive in vivo detection of this mutation which occurs in about 30% of breast cancers that could then be beneficially treated with the monoclonal antibody Herceptin. High resolution mammography and CT imaging would improve the limited sampling of biopsies and provide more thorough detection of even small tumors and metastases. If successful, this technology could be applied to other tumors for early detection and biochemical typing for more effective individualized treatments.  Progress so far has demonstrated and quantified targeting to Her2-positive tumors compared to Her2- negative ones. Definitive detection of tumors smaller than currently possible has been shown using our approach, which has the potential to enable earlier and specific detection of breast cancers, and ultimately achieve better patient outcomes.  However, a potential problem has become apparent during this work that might hinder clinical translation: the large gold nanoparticles (15 nm) used do not clear the body well, and their use might be difficult to justify in screening asymptomatic patients. Poor clearance would hinder FDA approval. Therefore, we propose in this Competitive Revision to develop gold nanoparticles that have good clearance. Overcoming this remaining obstacle would put in place a completed technology attractive to investors and clear the way for commercialization and clinical application. This work will address the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009 objectives by:  7 accelerating commercialization of the technology in order to achieve a significant benefit for cancer  patients (by overcoming remaining obstacle)  7 creating new jobs  7 increasing economic efficiency by spurring technological advances in science and health  7 leveraging this one-time supplement by establishing critical strategic partnerships and/or securing third-  party investments (i.e., non-federal funding) that will be necessary to achieve long-term  commercialization goals (making the technology saleable to investors)        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  A novel method using nanotechnology will be developed for improved non-invasive imaging and detection of breast cancer types by mammography and CT. This should not only enable better early detection of smaller tumors and metastases without painful biopsies, but identify tumor types so that specific drugs for the type can be administered. Such a need exists to detect Her2 breast cancers, which account for about 30% of breast cancers, where the specific drug Herceptin(R) is available and improves survival.",

This NSF Phase II SBIR program aims to develop and demonstrate large area and high performance nanocrystal thin film transistor (NC-TFT) based active matrix backplanes for flexible display applications.  A novel electrostatic self assembly (ESA) technology will allow significant cost reduction using organic, inorganic and hybrid materials. Such a molecular-level self-assembly approach to form TFT materials and devices offers numerous advantages since very different materials can be incorporated uniformly, using the same chemical process at room temperature, thus allowing the formation of TFT films on virtually any substrate material. During Phase I, single and arrayed NC-TFT devices were developed on rigid and flexible substrates with reliability and performance comparable to that of amorphous silicon based TFT devices. High-K hybrid gate dielectrics, such as ZrO2/SiO2 hybrid thin films, were also deposited through the same ESA method.  These films exhibited a dielectric constant larger than that of SiO2 (4.7 versus 3.9). Self-assembled gold nanoparticle-based memory devices. I-V tests were also investigated and fabricated.  I-V tests were conducted on the self-assembled TFT devices, as well as on operational memory devices. The field effect mobility of the prototype TFTs can reach 0.3 cm2/V/s and an On-Off ratio of 1000 was achieved. We also fabricated TFT-based gas sensors,\nwhich demonstrated high sensitivity to certain gas species such as ammonia. In the current project, we will design and develop prototype NCTFT-based active matrix backplanes on flexible substrates with improved efficiency and  performance and reduced cost, and beta-test those backplanes integrated with the E-paper based flexible display films and partners' flexible electronics and sensor platforms. This project also aims to establish a complete manufacturing process that is ready for production and licensing to selected flexible display customers.  The broader impact/commercial potential will be the development of flexible displays that offer many potential benefits over other display technologies, including reductions in cost, weight and power consumption, improved performance, ruggedness, and reliability. Other near term applications include 1) direct replacement for conventional circuit boards, wiring harnesses and flex interconnects on army vehicles, 2) as integrated sensing, signal processing and communicating clothing for army personnel, 3) electronic applications such as RF ID tags, antennas and stealth coatings, and 4) very large, mechanically-flexible deployable systems. This research has shown promise in producing devices of acceptable efficiencies at significantly reduced cost using organic, inorganic and conductive polymer materials. A revolutionary breakthrough in reducing the costs of TFT devices may be achieved if the semiconductor is deposited from solution onto large flexible substrates in roll-to-roll coating machines.",

        "abstract": "Electronic waste (e-waste) is one of the most rapidly growing waste problems worldwide.  Improper handling of e-waste results in vast amounts of toxic waste being sent to landfill and leaching into the water supply.  Due to there concerns e-waste recycling is a rapidly growing industry.  Unfortunately, most current e-waste recycling processes rely on either manual hand sorting or differential density sorting methods.  Manual hand sorting is expensive in the U.S. and has been associated with major environmental damage overseas.  Differential density sorting is expensive and is not very effective for sorting e-waste plastics.  When properly sorted there are a significant amount of valuable recyclable materials in e-waste.  Recycling rates for e-waste are currently low in part because e-waste recyclers charge a fee for recycling in order to make a profit.  Legislative action in many states may increase this rate, but the long term viability of e-waste recycling depends upon economical approaches to recovering theses valuable materials.  E-waste plastics often are difficult to re-use in part because of the inability to separate those materials which contain brominated flame retardant.  The objective of the proposed Phase II research is to complete development of the technology successfully tested in the Phase I research.  In order to assist in funding the deployment, testing, and further development of the prototype systems the proposing firm has obtained a commitment form an e-waste processor which has agreed to cooperated with NRT in the development and testing of the technology with Phase III funding.  A significant increase in the anticipated amount of e-waste has been observed over the last few years and is expected to continue as the time between introduction and obsolescence becomes continually smaller.  Because most electronic devices contain a significant number of plastic parts with and without flame retardants separation and recovery of these materials is crucial for long-term viability of environmentally friendly recycling of e-wastes.  It is anticipated that upon the successful completion of this Phase II research that the application of the technology will improve the costs of recycling e-wastes, improving the rate at which e-wastes are recycled.  The proposing firm is a major manufacturer of recycling equipment of the post-consumer plastics recycling industry and has received considerable interest in the development of a sorting system for sorting brominated plastics in e-waste plastics.  Due to this interest the proposed technology is expected to have a strong market in the e-waste recycling industry.",

We have accomplished each of these aims, and are now in the position to move past proof-of- concept, and to fully characterize a lead monoclonal antibody, prioritize additional monoclonal antibodies, and humanize HTRA1 monoclonal antibodies. These are the steps required to develop and ultimately commercialize a HTRA1 monoclonal antibody as a therapeutic. The Specific Aims are; Aim 1: Identify and prioritize murine monoclonal antibodies for human HTRA1 Aim 2: Determine efficacy of murine monoclonal antibodies in animal models of AMD Aim 3: Humanization of HTRA1 monoclonal antibodies The major milestones for Phase I was the identification of a monoclonal antibody that recognizes HTRA1 and is effective in two animal models of ophthalmic vascular disease. This has been completed. The major milestone for the Phase II application is the identification and characterization of a HTRA1 monoclonal antibody that will be humanized for clinical use. Thus, the Phase II application is designed to produce a humanized HTRA1 that will support a FDA IND application. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the most common cause of visual impairment of the elderly in developed countries. Increased levels of a protein, HTRA1, is an important cause of AMD. Navigen will develop HTRA1 monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of AMD.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II research project will enable detection of open circuit failures in semiconductor packages and integrated circuits with an accuracy of 10 microns by extending capabilities of magnetic current imaging. This has been one of the most difficult problems encountered by the industry today due to increasing complexity and shrinking of leading edge designs. The only technique available today is time domain reflectometry with practical resolution of 1-2 mm and time consuming layer-by-layer deprocessing. There is a critical need for a faster, non-destructive and more reliable technique capable of locating opens at a level commensurate with package level wiring approaching 10 microns pitch. It is proposed to use magnetic current imaging with a Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) to solve this critical need by analyzing high frequency signals effects at the defect location. It is expected that this approach will be able to detect opens with a resolution of about 10 microns.  The broader impacts of this research are: it will enable semiconductor companies to bring product to market faster and with greater reliability by rapidly finding and eliminating sources of open defects; it will benefit the nation by accelerating the introduction of advanced electronics that continuously improve quality of life for consumers, and bring opportunity gains that enhance the competitiveness of American industry.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A hernia occurs when part of an internal organ bulges through a weak area of fascia, with most hernias occurring in the abdomen. Surgical hernia repair is one of the most commonly performed surgeries in the US. While using prosthetic mesh as a reinforcement has significantly improved surgical outcomes, the rate of hernia recurrence can be more than 50%. Current synthetic meshes are associated with numerous complications, including increased risk of infection, prosthetic shrinkage, and host-foreign body reactions, leading to a diminished postoperative patient quality of life. The recent introduction of various biologic meshes derived from modified human or animal tissues has demonstrated lower rates of infection as compared to their synthetic counterparts. Equally important, effective immobilization of the mesh against the abdominal wall is critical to hernia repair success. Currently, sutures, staples, or tacks are used to fixate synthetic and biologic meshes in place, but these methods can be a source of nerve damage and chronic discomfort. Thus, there continues to be a need to develop alternative fixation methods that can effectively secure the mesh to the abdominal wall as well as improve long-term biocompatibility of these meshes. Marine mussels provided the inspiration for the new technology presented in this proposal. By releasing rapidly hardening, tightly binding adhesive proteins, marine mussels have the ability to anchor themselves to various surfaces in a wet, turbulent, and saline environment. Both natural proteins and their synthetic mimics can bind strongly to various substrates ranging from biological tissues to metal surfaces. In this proposal, biomimetic synthetic adhesives will be combined with a natural scaffold to create a novel bioadhesive prosthetic. The intent of such a construct is to create an effective repair with minimized long-term infection rate and chronic patient discomfort typically associated with permanent prosthetic materials and current fixation methods. The feasibility of using such a material for hernia repair will be tested.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:         Bioadhesive Membrane Construct for Hernia Repair Hernia repair is one of the most frequently performed surgical procedures in the United States. Current repair methods and materials have exhibited mixed success, but each has limitations such as high recurrence rate and persistent patient discomfort. The development and evaluation of a novel bioadhesive membrane construct for hernia repair is described here.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is currently no reliable therapy and no cure for tinnitus. Scientists at INSERM in Montpellier, France demonstrated the effectiveness of gacyclidine in an animal model of tinnitus. Later, clinical scientists the Medical University of Hannover (MHH) confirmed that gacyclidine suppressed human tinnitus in compassionate use individual patient therapy. However, for effective and practical tinnitus control, NST-001 (gacyclidine) must be formulated for chronic and long-term administration. In this regard, NST-001 is not sufficiently stable; not sufficiently soluble in its stable free base form; and suffers from problems of loss to catheters and other components of delivery systems during administration. In Phase I and follow-up research, NeuroSystec has successfully developed a squalene-based nanoparticle formulation that addresses the problems with NST-001 formulation. In this Phase II proposal NeuroSystec will continue with this formulation; the ultimate goal is to produce a commercially viable product that can be safely used for long term administration via an osmotic pump in humans. To accomplish this goal the Company has the following Specific Aims 1) Finalize a squalene (or other pharmaceutically acceptable lipid)-based nanoparticle formulation with and without NST- 001 suitable for animal studies, a pilot sterile manufacturing procedure for drug product and a sterile filtration methodology with lt5% drug loss. 2) Demonstrate that this formulation meets criteria for drug delivery and long term stability. Develop manufacturing and storage procedures for loading osmotic pumps with the sterile nanoparticles containing NST-001 formulation. 3) Establish the safety and efficacy of the NST-001 nanoparticle formulation in comparison to solution formulation in an animal model of tinnitus; compare the effectiveness of middle and inner ear delivery of the formulation. At the completion of Phase II NeuroSystec will be able to commence clinical testing of NST-001 to treat severe tinnitus.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There is currently no cure and no effective therapy for severe tinnitus, a disease that afflicts approximately 2 million Americans. NeuroSystec will develop and evaluate a novel lipid based nanoparticle formulation to deliver a promising new drug to the inner ear for the treatment of severe tinnitus.",

DNAPolBase will serve as a freely available, high quality resource of DNA polymerase biochemistry, biology, genetics and structure. The worksite for this project will be New England Biolabs, in Ipswich, MA. The corruption of DNA copying is responsible for virtually all genetic disease states and the core machines responsible for this copying process are DNA polymerases. DNA polymerases are also key elements in a variety of diagnostic and molecular biology applications including DNA sequencing and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Polymerase-based applications frequently involve non-natural substrates and reaction conditions, and engineered enzymes well suited to these applications are increasingly sought. The identification of novel polymerases and entire new super families has spurred renewed interest in these enzymes. This abundance of information makes it increasingly difficult for casual and experienced researchers alike to maintain a comprehensive view of the field. Despite their importance, no single repository for information relevant to the study and use of DNA polymerases currently exists. We will compile the wealth of known polymerase data from public and private records into a searchable database to provide a useful first step in understanding the role of these enzymes in vivo, and to inform their use in and adaptation to numerous applications. As part of the groundwork of database development, key collaborations with scientists willing to seed this database with their own libraries of private and public polymerase data and records have begun. From this auspicious start a database will be organized to serve the informational needs of numerous user groups, including basic and pharmaceutical researchers, application based scientists, instructors, and students. Functions from large-scale comparative studies (desired to advance many aspects of polymerase-based research and applications) to simple queries of polymerase properties or origins will be provided.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of this project is to develop a novel blood storage system that will extend the shelf life of additive system red cell units, and at the same time, deliver red cells of higher efficacy and lower toxicity for transfusion therapy. In this system, red cells are stored in a modified additive solution under oxygen-depleted condition (anaerobic storage). The final product will have extended shelf life (9 weeks or more) as well as higher efficacy and lower toxicity compared to same-aged blood stored by conventional methods (more viable cells, higher oxygen delivery capacity immediately after transfusion and more deformable cells for better capillary perfusion). The new storage system is design to be readily accommodated by the current blood banking operation without incurring major alteration in procedures or equipments. In the Phase I of this project, an experimental procedure was used to demonstrated that anaerobic storage yields; i) a significantly higher post- transfusion recovery compared to the conventional method after 6 weeks of storage; and ii) a comparable 9-week recovery compared to 6-week storage under conventional conditions. The main aim of this Phase II proposal is to demonstrate that an experimental hardware/ processes used in the Phase I can be reduced to practice by fabricating a blood collection/storage system that is self-contained and easily accommodated under current blood bank settings without compromises in its performances. In partnership with University of Pittsburgh, Filtertek and Multisorb Technologies, several prototypes storage system will be designed, fabricated and tested in vitro. Subsequently, an optimized prototype system will be tested in a clinical trial at Dartmouth- Hitchcock Medical Center with a goal of obtaining results comparable to ones attained under experimental procedure in the Phase I. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In the past several years, a number of papers have appeared in scientific journals questioning the quality of red blood cells stored for transfusion. They indicated that; i) worse clinical outcomes were associated with higher number of units transfused; ii) blood transfusion may not have induced increased oxygen utilization in tissues; and iii) worse post-operative outcomes were associated with patients receiving blood stored for longer than 14 days compared with patients receiving less than 14-day old blood. Proposed anaerobic red blood cell storage system delivers higher post- transfusion viability and uncompromised oxygen delivery capacity, thereby improving the efficacy of transfusion therapy while reducing side effects of transfusion. Transfusion of such red cells will reduce the frequency- and time- averaged blood transfusion volume and total iron burden in subjects who require chronic transfusion (e.g., sickle cell disease or beta-thalassemia). Extended shelf life will improve the logistics of general blood bank operations, alleviate the periodic blood shortages, and increase the utility of pre-operative autologous blood donation.",

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses an opportunity to build on the recent enthusiastic market acceptance in touch interfaces with a new exciting feature-enhanced technology. The patented high-dimensional touchpad (HDTP) employs a tactile matrix sensors to capture nuances of finger contact that current touch interfaces cannot detect. Machine vision techniques are used to extract control information from measured tactile contact and direct it to control a system or device. The HDTP has all capabilities of available touch interfaces with far more continuously-variable parameters from a single finger and numerous new features. The SBIR Phase II project objectives are: 1) create a working HDTP prototype from the test system of SBIR Phase I; 2) characterize suitability of available tactile matrix sensors for commercial HDTP products; 3) develop expanded repertoire of touch interactions combining existing techniques with others unique to the HDTP; and 4) conduct human studies comparing the HDTP with other touch interfaces. Expected outcomes of this Phase II project are: a working prototype providing eight or more useful continuously-variable parameters (four or more in a small area); identification of best suited sensors; an expanded range of touch interaction techniques; human study results showing HDTP capabilities surpasses those of other touch interfaces.  The past\neighteen months have seen the emergence of a new generation of touch interfaces that exploit multi-touch and gesture interactions to create user interfaces substantially more usable than other user interfaces. With the success of the iPhone, advanced touch interfaces are now appearing in a variety of products ranging from laptop and multi-user table-top computers to PDAs to competing smartphones to digital cameras. The heightened interest in touch interfaces and their increasing prevalence make finding ways to improve them especially important. Considerable effort is now being devoted to developing advanced touch interfaces. The proposed project will advance that research. As a high-dimensional touch interface operated in an intuitive way with a wide range of powerful new capabilities, a large number of possible applications, and well-suited for use in handheld devices, the HDTP has the potential to be very widely adopted. Because of the size and number of potential markets for the HDTP, even a modest market share in some of them could result in substantial profits. Further, the HDTP's sensitivity and adaptability makes it well-suited for use as an assistive device for the disabled, thus promoting the goal of universal access.",

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase II project will demonstrate a promising method for continuous noninvasive glucose monitoring based on an innovative optical sensing technology. To date no organization has been successful in producing an FDA-approved non-invasive glucometer, i.e. one that provides a level of sensitivity and selectivity equivalent to the current self-test method (deposition of a blood droplet on a test strip). The primary difficulty in building an accurate instrument has been the reliable discrimination of the weak glucose signature from interfering effects inherent in live human tissue. Newton Photonics (NP) has developed a new approach based on optical coherence tomography (OCT). Researchers have previously demonstrated that OCT could detect a person's glucose level. Unfortunately, the considerable influence of physiological effects, especially those of cell size, tissue hydration and tissue non-uniformity, have limited the practical application of this modality. NP integrates OCT sensing with thermal modulation of the skin and new noise reduction techniques to overcome this critical deficiency. In Phase I, NP demonstrated the principles of operation in experiments using phantoms and ex-vivo tissue. In Phase-II NP will upgrade the system for human testing and conduct pre-clinical trials.  NP's non-invasive glucose\nmonitor will improve the lives of millions of individuals whose health depends on the external control of their glucose levels. The NP monitor provides continuous data output. It maintains its measurement accuracy without the frequent calibration required by commercially available subcutaneous probes. These capabilities will enable convenient, pain-free operation. Two groups of users will benefit from this technology: a) hospitals will improve the health and longevity of intensive care patients while simultaneously reducing the cost of healthcare. Approximately 20 million intensive care unit (ICU) patients per year frequently suffer hyperglycemia as a result of major surgery or illness. A 2001 landmark medical study demonstrated that tight glycemic control of ICU patients leads directly to reduced hospital stay duration and also provides a 3-8% decrease in first year post-hospitalization death rate. b) Self-testing diabetics will have a convenient, painless way to more frequently monitor their glucose level and thus control it more accurately. Diabetes is a chronic disease with no cure. The direct cost of treating diabetes and its complications in the US was $92 billion in 2002, approximately 10% of the entire annual cost of the US healthcare system.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project focuses on improving efficiency and reducing cost associated with the production of energy, liquid fuels, and value-added chemicals from gasified biomass.  Unlike most other sources of biofuels, gasification would not directly compete with food sources since virtually any organic matter can be used as the feedstock.  Examples of feedstocks include agricultural residue, wood chips, and municipal waste.  However, biomass gasification is currently a capital intensive process because of the difficulty with producing a clean syngas (free of tars and pollutants) for use in downstream turbines or chemical production steps.  Tar removal is necessary to protect down-stream equipment in the process.  Within this project, NexTech will develop and commercialize a novel catalytic monolith capable of reforming tars into a useful product, syngas, improving system efficiency.  This will be done by first optimizing the processing steps required to produce the monolith, then verifying the monolith performance in independent testing.  The end product will provide gasifier users with a simpler and less expensive method for tar removal than currently used approaches.  The production of energy and liquid fuels from biomass will have a number of beneficial societal impacts.  The gasification\nprocess is carbon neutral, since it uses CO2 that was captured from plants; therefore, biomass gasification will replace energy production from fossil fuels, thus reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  Unlike fuel crops, biomass is a waste product that has no use for human consumption, so the technology does not compete with food sources.  Further, using biomass as a source of energy will reduce the dependence of our nation on foreign sources of energy.  The technology being developed could have application to a wide range of other catalytic reactions as well, including lean burn diesel engine exhaust treatment, hydrocarbon reforming and gas-to-liquid processes.  From a scientific standpoint, the technology being developed in this project is unique from traditional catalysts, and the basic principles could be applied to a wide range of applications.  Additionally, the work being carried out during this project will improve understanding of catalyst deactivation from sulfur poisoning and carbon formation.  Overall, the project will contribute novel results to the body of literature in catalysis and materials development.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will result in the commercialization of high power, large area, deep UV LEDs based on a novel vertically conducting geometry that is arbitrarily scalable. AlInGaN based deep UV-B LEDs (\u00c3\u00bd\u00c3\u00bd = 300 - 340 nm) have recently been developed and commercialized but have not reached the performance metrics of shorter wavelength UV-C LEDs, or longer wavelength visible LEDs. These devices have been able to penetrate some niche markets but because the output power is far below that which is required for penetration of the largest UV-B market segments (e.g. biomedical instrumentation and industrial curing) they have been limited in their reach. Visible LEDs faced a similar challenge 5-10 years ago and it was recognized that to compete with existing technology, high power large area LEDs were required. This approach has been limited for deep UV LEDs because the insulating UV transparent substrates combined with relatively large resistance AlGaN materials result in current crowding and non-uniform device bias when geometry is scaled up. To address this challenge, the company is developing vertically conducting large area LEDs with expected minimum output powers of 10 mW per 1 mm x 1 mm device.  Deep UV light emitting diodes represent a new opportunity for commercialization of\nsemiconductor products for component and systems use. U.S. based manufacturers have succeeded in competing globally in the visible LED market with two of the five largest LED manufacturers being based in the U.S. with two in Japan and one in Germany. This optoelectronic field continues to grow each year and if the outcome of this effort is successful its outcome will contribute to the advancement of a novel light source. The creation of this company will capitalize on the high-tech research that is being performed at the University Of South Carolina by providing an environment in which to transition this knowledge into a commercial setting as part of efforts to transition the local economy from traditional industries such as textile manufacturing.",

This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will result in the development of a novel semiconductor growth technique to produce low dislocation density III-nitride AlInGaN substrate materials for high efficiency deep UVLEDs and electronic devices. This novel growth technique termed Metalorganic Hydride Vapor Phase Epitaxy (MOHVPE) is a hybrid of Metalorganic Chemical Vapor Deposition (MOCVD), used for device growth where atomic layer accuracy is required, and Hydride Vapor Phase Epitaxy (HVPE), used for fast bulk growth. Their combination in a single growth reactor allows for the growth of very thick, low dislocation density films as substrates templates. Then the growth mode can be switched to the metalorganic sources to grow atomically controlled device active layers, such as quantum wells, without taking the wafer out of the growth chamber.  The MOHVPE AlGaN substrate technology will lead to higher efficiency Power Electronics and deep UV LEDs. Deep UV LEDs offer the potential to greatly increase our understanding of the interaction between UV light and biological/microbiological species. This is increasingly important as we confront the global trends of an aging population (healthcare), increased population density leading to greater pathogen exposure and water shortages, and greater cross-border travel. Researchers are just beginning to investigate applications for UV radiation including cancer treatment, increased plant/food yield, and genetic modification with an increasing interest based on the ability to more controllably deliver UV radiation to particular points of interest that has been enabled by UV LEDs.",

The demand for these isotopes cannot be met by existing inventory or through foreign supplies.  Meanwhile, existing isotope separation technologies have limitations in cost and quantity.  Therefore, this project will develop a next generation isotope separation technology, the Integrated Spin System (ISS), for producing large quantities of stable isotopes efficiently and economically.  In Phase I, proof-of-concept was demonstrated experimentally through the separation of different gas species and gaseous isotopes.  Engineering data showed that the ISS was adept in separating metallic isotopes directly, without the use of chemicals.  In Phase II, a detailed engineering prototype will be designed and constructed, and the separation of large quantities of Ge-76, Xe-136 and other isotopes will be demonstrated. Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The use of stable isotopes is strategically important to the U.S., encompassing broad areas of scientific research, medical applications, and industries.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II Project proposes the construction of a biosensor device prototype that will produce text from electromyographic (EMG) signals recorded from hand muscles. This biosensor device will enable the user to enter text into a computer or a mobile device without the need of special paper, pen, or other devices to track the pen. Recent advances in various technologies have made it practical to develop the EMG detection and analysis techniques suitable for character recognition. Taking advantage of advances in electrophysiology, pattern recognition, signal processing, and computer engineering, this project proposes to develop a practical system to decipher the EMG signals generated by biosensors mounted in the digital glove. The project will use the test bed system that was developed during Phase I project and helped to prove the concept. The knowledge of hand EMG patterns of various characters that were gained during Phase I will be used in the development of hardware device. The development will be conducted in the areas of Data Collection, Data Representation (preparation), and Data Analysis. The improvements are expected in all three areas, due to the use of more advanced electrodes, data processing filters, and the application of Neural Networks algorithms.  The proposed approach will remove several limitations faced by current technology and should provide a more durable, flexible, accurate, and user friendly product that can be easily adapted to\ndifferent users for taking notes, or writing SMS messages for cell phones. The technology will significantly impact the condition of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, a common occupational illness being reported among typists. EMG-based fingerless glove can also be used as alternative communication device by disabled people who are not able to talk, or who have hearing problems. The resulting product has many applications in education, medicine, tele-robotics, and can be used by mobile workers. As a wearable computer device, this product will help to improve users' image and self esteem. This research project will contribute to the better understanding of muscle interactions. Finally, the handwriting application that will be developed, can become a test bed for analyzing and comparing various pattern recognition algorithms, including traditional statistical algorithms and neural networks, for example Self Organizing Maps (SOM), State Vector Machine (SVM), or Time Lagged Recurrent Networks (TLRN). These algorithms already have numerous applications in various fields.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this project is to develop and evaluate a specialized online version of a marital education program for resource (i.e., foster, kinship, and adoptive) parents. The program, called Prevention and Relationship Enhancement Program (PREP), is a well-researched, highly effective, and widely used curriculum that has been adapted already for use with certain select populations, though not specifically with resource couples. Foster, kinship, and adoptive couples face extraordinary challenges that can, and do, have a large impact on their marriages. Standard family contexts and dynamics for intervention do not generalize to these couples. However, marital education tailored to the special needs and circumstances of these parents could provide them with much needed social-communication skills to avoid negative interaction patterns in their marital relationship and to steer their expectations into a healthy framework. In Phase I we successfully developed and tested the first two modules from the PREP program. Findings provided strong support for the efficacy of the online version with this population. In Phase II we will produce another 13 modules adapted to this population to complete the program. We will evaluate the full, finished program with a national sample of 100 foster, adoptive, and kinship couples on measures of knowledge, communication and conflict management skills, a variety of indicators of a healthy marriage, and a test of parent and child adjustment. Fittingly, the recruitment of subjects, as well as the implementation and testing of the training intervention, will all be done online. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Subjects participating in this project will gain important information and skills to help them understand and manage the unique challenges of married life for foster, adoptive, and kinship couples. As a result, the quality of the marriage, parenting, family life, the resource child's adjustment, and the stability of the placement could improve.",

The program, developed by the Institute for Human Services, is a standardized pre-service training curriculum in current use nationally. Face- to-face contact between agencies and parents allows staff to screen and forge relationships with the parents. However, a substantial part of the training involves instructional activities that build knowledge and shape attitudes essential to foster care. Delivering these components online offers distinct advantages: First and foremost, online modules could serve as make-up classes for parents who miss a class. This would allow parents and agencies to complete the entire training without having to devote additional resources for a make-up class or having to restart or delay the training. It would also give other homebound caregivers in the family the opportunity to view the curriculum. The online modules could also be used as an added teaching tool for classroom training. In the proposed program the 12 proposed online training modules would be stand-alone instructional units. In Phase I we developed a foundational module using Flash technology on Child Abuse and Neglect. The feasibility study showed that the interactive multimedia delivery was in fact more effective than the classroom delivery in conveying knowledge; it also received higher user satisfaction ratings than the classroom training; and it was slightly more effective than the classroom training in increasing empathy for birth parents. In Phase II we will develop and evaluate each of the remaining 11 training modules. The online modules will also be produced for CD to accommodate parents who do not have access to high-speed Internet. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Subjects participating in this project will gain important information that will prepare them to be effective resource parents for foster or adopted children. As a result, the quality and skill of their parenting could improve, as well as the well-being of the children in their care.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over one-quarter of all oral antibiotics prescribed in the United States are for acute otitis media. Tympanostomy tube (TT) insertion has become the treatment of choice for children with recurrent or chronic otitis media, with more than two million tubes sold annually in the US. Tympanostomy is the most common pediatric procedure under general anesthesia in the developed world. Chronic post-tympanostomy tube otorrhea (PTTO) is often refractory to treatment and inflicts significant morbidity in the form of hearing loss and long-term middle ear dysfunction. The Co-investigators have confirmed that chronic middle ear infection is a mucosal biofilm disease, and this may explain why otitis media is often difficult to treat with antibiotics. Biofilm growth on the TT surface and on middle ear mucosa may be a source of recurrent infections, and thus may also be a primary contributor. Between 10% and 50% of children with tubes experience otorrhea, and approximately 25% of children with a primary set of tubes will have to go on to have a second set of tubes. Based on prior studies, we believe that we can reduce the number of episodes and episode duration of PTTO by creating antimicrobial eluting ear tubes based on developing novel materials. We have designed a combination therapy that will provide broad-spectrum activity against planktonic and biofilm-forming species associated with otitis media. The antimicrobials selected will also reduce the likelihood of the development of resistant strains. We have demonstrated in Phase I that we can suppress biofilm formation and planktonic growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus for an extended period of time. By modifying the release kinetics, we believe we can increase this time period of efficacy even further. Our data also suggests that we have a synergistic interaction between antimicrobials. We have also demonstrated that we can make materials which are not cytotoxic to rabbit fibroblasts. The Specific Aims of this Phase II study are: 1) to optimize the release kinetics of our new materials and to injection mold TTs, 2) to confirm our in vitro studies with Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae, and quantify synergy and monitor for the development of resistant strains, 3) to assess ototoxicity, sensitivity and irritation in animal models, and 4) to compare the ability of experimental tubes with control tubes to treat and prevent PTTO in the chinchilla model of otitis media. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In Phase I, we developed a combination of antimicrobial/antibiotic compounds incorporated in host polymers that significantly inhibits bacterial attachment and biofilm development of organisms associated with otitis media. We plan to develop tympanostomy tube materials using such combination strategies and test their safety in an established animal model.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this project is to discover novel broad-spectrum antibiotics acting against critically important human pathogens. The unmet need is especially acute for Gram negative pathogens, where we are rapidly running out of options for treating multidrug resistant species of Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Burkholderia, Klebsiella and Enterobacter. This is a challenging goal, since the last novel class of broad-spectrum antibiotics was discovered 40 years ago. NovoBiotic has a proprietary technology capable of meeting this challenge. We will obtain new antimicrobials from a previously inaccessible source - uncultured microorganisms that make up 99% of the total microbial diversity. In Phase I, we developed a trap for specific capture and growth of uncultured Actinomycetes. Most antibiotics derive from culturable representatives of this group of bacteria. The trap is a sterile slice of agar sandwiched between semi-permeable membranesthat is inserted into soil. Actinomycetes produce hyphae which enable them to penetrate into the trap through the pores in the membrane and form pure colonies. Many uncultured species that initially grow in situ are then capable of growing under regular conditions in vitro. The aims of Phase I were to assemble a collection of 1,000 novel Actinomycetes using the trap method, screen them for antimicrobial activity and dereplicate 50 of them. We achieved these milestones ahead of schedule and have in place a robust technology that will enable us to discover broad-spectrum antibiotics in this Phase II project. Half of the Actinomycetes captured by the trap are new, an impressive indication of the usefulness of this method. Of the 92 compounds that were dereplicated, we discovered two new antibiotics, one of which belongs to a novel class, glycosylated macrolactams. This suggests a probability of discovery ~10-2, compared to the current estimate of 10-7 for novel compounds from conventional culturable strains. The hit rate for compounds with broad-spectrum activity from this pilot library was 1%, and 1 of these 12 dereplicated antimicrobials is a potentially novel antibiotic. These findings strongly suggest that an expanded discovery effort in Phase II will lead to a considerable number of new broad-spectrum antimicrobials. In this project, we will screen up to 750,000 trap isolates, which should produce ~30 new broadspectrum compounds. There in vitro validation and structure determination will be followed by evaluation for toxicity in an animal model, and for efficacy in a murine model of K. pneumonia pulmonary infection. The end result of Phase II will be 2-3 validated novel broad-spectrum leads. These will be developed into drugs in the next phase of the program. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bacteria that cause infections in the community and in hospitals are becoming increasingly resistant to currently available antibiotics; therefore there is an urgent need for new antibiotics that will ensure public health in the years to come. The purpose of this project is to employ a new technology to discover the next generation of effective antibiotics. These antibiotics will also provide the public with a stronger defense against the threat of bioterror.",

This Small Business Innovation Research(SBIR)Phase II project seeks to overcome the principal impediments of the inconsistent quality of metal matrix composite (MMC) materials from fly ash and aluminum. This project utilizes highly processed ash derived ceramics (ADC) as a reinforcing phase in aluminum MMCs manufactured with powder metallurgy (P/M) methods. The processed ADC has a narrow size distribution and is free of carbon, magnetite, and cenospheres. In powder metal technology the ADC alters the strength, stiffness, and hardness of the aluminum. When blended with aluminum powders and compacted into parts, aluminum MMC materials can be fabricated with stiffness properties like ductile iron. Sintering parameters can be manipulated to control the aluminum-ADC reaction and the silicon metal and spinel that it generates, thus creating wear resistance and hardness. The MMC then behaves like a hypereutectic alloy. The primary objective of this project is to formulate one or more high performance ADC-aluminum MMCs that are ready for commercial deployment. Achieving this level of performance will allow ADC?aluminum MMCs to compete directly with hypereutectic alloys and ductile iron in the production of parts for the transportation\nindustry.  The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be the ability to derive high quality, ash derived ceramics (ADC) that are recovered from coal combustion ash for use in new light weight high strength composite materials. These materials are needed in the transportation industry where weight, cost, and performance are critical. ADC-aluminum metal matrix composites can be used to manufacture parts for the transportation industry such as brake rotors, and drive train components that are currently made from ductile iron or hypereutectic alloys, materials that are heavier and/or difficult to machine. This material change will decrease the overall weight of the vehicle, thereby improving its fuel efficiency and performance while improving the margins for parts manufacturers. This technology will create a new commodity that will lead to the creation of new jobs and help support the needs of the automotive and transportation industries.",

        "abstract": "Problem: This project will demonstrate the applicability of using rice bran and rice bran extract as a commercial scale growth medium for yeast. Currently, the production of yeast is carried out on a high sugar starting medium composed of beet or cane molasses, both of which are in short supply and command high prices. The innovative process proposed by Nutraceutical Innovations uses as a starting medium heat-stabilized defatted rice bran (HDRB), a low cost, typically underutilized co-product from the rice milling industry. Rice bran is available in large supply (1.6 billion lbs annually in the U.S. alone)(USDA, 2003), but has little commercial value in the food industry largely because of its indigestibility and unpalatability. Although the unprocessed bran byproduct has little value ?as is,? it does serve as a rich source of nutraceutical oil, and it can be processed to remove the rice bran oil. Commercially, when the oil is extracted, the rice bran undergoes a heat stabilization step to preserve the quality of the oil. The resulting by-product after oil extraction is called heatstabilized defatted rice bran (HDRB), a potentially rich source of protein, starch, fiber, vitamins and minerals with nutraceutical health benefits. The potential commercial and health benefits of HDRB, although significant, are largely unrealized because of the lack of sound scientific investigation into the applications for HDRB as a functional food ingredient. Currently, HDRB is primarily used as a filler in animal feed, and commands a sales price of only $0.03/pound. Proteins, phenolics, and bioactive molecules are bound and unavailable. Nutraceutical Innovations, Inc. recognizes both the economic and nutritional potential of HDRB, and is developing novel, value added processing methods for HDRB from which extracts can be derived, allowing for the development of new food ingredients with health benefits. The process under development has direct applicability to the yeast production industry, and if successfully commercialized, promises significant economic benefits over the current process. The proposed process utilizes the HDRB to produce co-products that will have significant value in the market, and provide health benefits to the consumer. Purpose: The overall objective of the Phase II effort is to develop and test a cost-competitive process for producing yeast and co-products using HDRB extracts as a growth medium. Successful completion of the project objectives will produce a minimum of 30-logs of growth of up to 4 strains of yeast in HDRB extracts, and at least two coproducts with viability for use as beneficial food additives. The broad vision of Nutraceutical Innovations is to develop a spectrum of commercially valuable products from HDRB using the patent pending total systems approach. The conceived commercial opportunities range from relatively low risk products and processes with ready markets (e.g. licensing the patent pending process that uses HDRB as the energy and nutrient source for the production of yeast) to potentially promising but untested product concepts (e.g. anti-cancer therapeutics from fermentation extracts).",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Fracture risk assessment is integral to the diagnosis and management of osteoporosis, a devastating clinical condition of which over 40 million Americans are at risk. Due to limitations in areal BMD measures obtained from 2D DXA scans - the current clinical standard for diagnosis of osteoporosis - it has recently become clear that those at risk of osteoporotic fracture need to be better identified. A 3D biomechanics-based technique, which we term Biomechanical Computed Tomography (BCT), addresses this need through a combination of engineering finite element analysis, 3D quantitative computed tomography (QCT), and bone fracture biomechanics. The main outcome parameter of BCT is an estimate of the biomechanical risk of a bone fracture that accounts for such factors as the patient's 3D bone geometry and distribution of bone density, body-weight, height, trochanteric soft tissue thickness (for hip fractures), muscle moment arm (for spine), and the age-related risk of sustaining an overload event (such as a fall or lifting of a heavy object with back bent). In the larger context of translating BCT to clinical practice, we seek in this Phase II SBIR project to test the overall hypothesis that BCT is a better predictor of osteoporotic fracture than is areal BMD, for both hip and spine fracture and for both women and men. In Phase I of this project, we successfully applied this technique to explain observed age-related trends in hip fracture rates. For Phase II, we plan in our first Aim to refine our BCT technique to produce a fully automated, highly reliable and highly accurate software suite with the capability to analyze CT scans acquired for any medical test with coverage of the hip and/or spine without an external calibration phantom. For Aim 2, in order to ensure optimal prediction of clinical fractures, we will further refine our overall BCT process by calibrating results from the two cohorts (the Mayo Clinic cohort of 750 men and women in Rochester MN, and the MrOS cohort of 3,500 men in six U.S. locations). Issues to be resolved in this calibration process include determining optimal methods for measuring soft tissue thickness, muscle moment arms, and spine loading. This analysis will also enable us to calibrate our function for age- related risk of sustaining an overload event, which may depend on both fracture type (hip vs. spine) and sex. In Aim 3, we will compile normative data for BCT outcomes, critical information for interpretation of clinical results. Having refined and calibrated the overall BCT technique and identified the most successful BCT predictors of clinical fracture in the Mayo and MrOS cohorts, we will proceed in Aim 4 to test the validity of these predictors in a fully prospective manner, without any further modification of the BCT technique. For this, we will analyze the AGES cohort of 5,500 women and men in Reykjavik, Iceland, for incident hip and spine fracture. Taken together, this multi-cohort international validation study will provide new insight into osteoporotic fracture etiology, important advancements for the BCT method, and a thorough evaluation of BCT clinical performance. This project should therefore have a significant impact on osteoporosis research and clinical practice. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Statement of Relevance This project will provide clinical validation to Biomechanical Computed Tomography, a promising clinical alternative to DXA for the diagnosis of osteoporosis. Successful translation of BCT to clinical practice has the potential to greatly improve non-invasive assessment of fracture risk, which would represent an important advance in the preventative care and treatment of osteoporosis.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The presence of Her-2, estrogen receptor (ER) or progesterone receptor (P) on breast cancer cells is a very important biomarker which facilitates physicians in making decisions on treatment schemes and in proposing prognosis of the disease. Current methods for diagnostic and prognostic classifications of ER, PR and Her2/neu are based on immunohistochemistry (IHC), a technique that has been used in clinical medicine for over 80 years. However, the immunoenzyme (HRP-based) IHC method has a single color nature and is unable to perform multiplexed molecular profiling. Moreover, IHC remains semi-quantitative and subjective, resulting in considerable inter-observer variations of results. Semiconductor nanocrystals also known as quantum dots (QDs) are a new class of biological detection labels, which present a broad range of biomedical applications including multicolor labeling, single molecule biophysics, biomolecular profiling, optical barcoding, and in vitro and in vivo imaging. Current studies have indicated that QDs can be used for multiplex detection of ER, PR and Her2 in breast tumor tissue. In Phase I work, we have demonstrated that genetic engineered protein G fragment can serve as universal linker to conjugate nanoparticles with antibodies, which presented the probes with small size and antibody orientation. In phase II, we will first separate the circulating cancer cells and then quantitatively analyze the expression levels of ER, PR and Her2/neu biomarkers in a multiplexed fashion. Our overall goal is to develop an assay that is capable of isolating circulating cancer cells while quantifing the expression levels of a panel of cancer biomarkers to provide guidance for cancer treatment. 1 PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Breast cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States. In 2007, about 1,444,920 new cancer cases were expected to be diagnosed, and about 559,650 Americans were expected to die of cancer-more than 1,500 people per day. The presence of several important biomarkers on breast cancer cells is a very important diagnostic criterion, which facilitates physicians in making decisions on treatment schemes and in proposing prognosis of the disease. However it has been difficult to accurately, simultaneously measure the expression levels of these receptors. The development of nanotechnology, especially the development of bioconjugated nanoparticles provides an essential solution. Successful development of this project will significantly advance the technique of multiplex quantification of expression levels of various cancer receptors and provide valuable guidance for more effective treatments.",

        "abstract": "Development of accelerator structures that can sustain acceleration gradients of ~150 MeV/m are required in order to build a future multi-TeV collider.  High-power facilities for testing these structures do not generate sufficiently-high peak powers, hence RF pulse compressors are needed to provide power multiplication.  However, active RF pulse compressors are limited in peak power due to RF breakdown, mainly on the surfaces of non-metallic elements within their active switches.  This project will investigate a high-power RF switch concept in which the active element is a pulsed electron beam.  In this approach, the switch could operate at higher peak power levels, because no insulating elements \u00c2\u00bf where breakdown might occur \u00c2\u00bf would be present within the switch.  In Phase I, three prototype electron-beam-triggered switches were designed and built, each with different cathode and anode geometries.  With these switches connected to an RF storage resonator, low power tests were conducted, and compressed pulses with peak power gains in the range of 10:1 to 20:1 were observed.  In Phase II, a high-power version of electron-beam-triggered switches will be designed, and prototypes will be built and tested.  The goal is to produce compressed pulses in the range of 150-200 MW, with pulse widths in the range of 50-100 ns, power gains in the range of 10:1-15:1, and efficiency higher than 60%. Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Development of structures that can sustain high accelerating gradients without an undue probability of breakdown, and which can be the basis for a future multi-TeV electron-positron collider, should hasten the day when the multi-TeV collider will be built.  Once the multi-TeV collider is ready for construction, many commercial companies will benefit from the multi-million dollar manufacturing contracts for the accelerator structures and other elements in the collider",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High-throughput genotyping, expression, and sequencing technologies and the development of increasingly sophisticated methods for predicting gene-disease interactions have given the new field of genomic-based personalized medicine a wealth of data: more, in fact, than can easily be processed and interpreted. Omicia is in the business of developing computational tools and diagnostics in the field of personalized medicine for cardiovascular disease (CVD). As part of that effort we are developing a software infrastructure that uses these abundant data to identify and prioritize candidate genes and their sequence variations for clinical evaluation. The research proposed in this application has three aims. In Phase II, we will enhance and optimize Omicia's Gene Inference System (GIS), prototyped during the SBIR Phase I project. In Phase II we will add additional capabilities to its candidate gene identification methods. This will build upon the Omicia Disease Genes (ODG) ontology built in Phase I, and add pathway and protein-interaction data and include  top  candidates from external publicaly-available clinical studies. In Aim 2, we will enhance the ability of GIS to prioritize sequence variations by improving our novel paralogous-gene variation identification algorithm (iDIP) and by integrating existing amino-acid substitution (AAS) methods. By running these algorithms over all known human genes via dbSNP, we expect to identify a list of candidate variations that will be evaluated in Aim 3 including an in vitro experiment. The goal of Aim 3 is to test the gene- and variant-predictive power of GIS and to compare it to other selection methods. The clinical study will be a single-stage case control design to test the  top  variant candidates from Aims 1 and 2 and compare the potential association to well-established genetic markers for the risk of myocardial infarction (MI). With approximately 700 cases and 700 matched controls, our association study will be well powered to test our predicted functional markers for MI. The GIS infrastructure is an integral part of the commercial workflow of Omicia, and will form the basis of the product pipeline. As such, it will serve as licensable commercial technology for the company by helping other biotechnology companies to develop their genetic biomarkers for diagnostic and therapeutic developments (theranostics). In addition, any novel variants drawn from this Phase II study will be licensable and exploitable intellectual property, useful both as the basis for future products in our internal pipeline, as well as potentially valuable additions to our patent portfolio. The Phase II goals of enhancing and clinically validating GIS serve three purposes: proving our methodology as applied to CVD and opening the door to applications in other disease areas; showcasing GIS as a key technology for managing complexity in the post-genomic era and providing clinically-relevant insights; and finally, potentially identifying valuable IP in the form of novel genetic markers for MI.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The outcome of this project will be an evaluated gene inference system (GIS) for identifying gene-disease interactions, with a focus in the area of cardiovascular disease (CVD). This system will be used as part of the Omicia product pipeline, and can also be licensed to third parties. In addition, any novel genetic markers identified as part of the validation study will themselves be valuable additions to the Omicia product and IP portfolio. Omicia's goal is to provide content and analysis tools for molecular diagnostic tests for cardiovascular conditions, with the promise of identifying patients at high risk to enable them to begin preventive care before symptoms appear. Given the prevalence of CVD in the developed world, these products are potentially a great boon to public health, as well as being significant commercial opportunities.",

The program will include behaviorally focused communication skills training and educational content that is designed to support parental values regarding sexual behavior of their child. Educational content will include information on effective parental monitoring and networking strategies and information about puberty. In addition, program content will be targeted by (a) parental race/ethnicity (i.e., African-American, Caucasian, and Hispanic), (b) parental gender, and (c) gender of the child. When complete, this comprehensive program will include an Internet/CD-ROM component for use by the parent, another for use by the child and finally, a DVD for the parent and child to view together. A stand-alone DVD program suitable for home DVD players will be created for group presentations and families without access to computers or the Internet. The program will be designed to effectively address the knowledge deficits of both parents and their children, and provide training and modeling in effective communication between the parent and child that are consistent with the parent's values regarding adolescent sexual behavior. It will be appropriate for use in a broad range of settings (e.g., homes, worksites, health, and community organizations). The Phase II will be evaluated in a randomized trial with parents and children across the United States. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: While rates of teen pregnancy have declined in the past 10 years, this is still an important issue for families of preadolescents and teens. Parents have the potential to positively influence their child's values around pregnancy prevention and sexual activity.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Unintentional injuries are the leading cause of death for children and infants under 14 years of age. Many of these deaths are preventable -not only by prevention behaviors such as installing safety gates and using car seats effectively - but also by administering prompt and effective emergency first aid techniques until advanced care arrives. While programs such as the American Red Cross offer instructor-led courses for families to obtain these skills, many motivated parents, guardians and other caregivers are unable to attend these classes due to difficulties in obtaining and scheduling childcare and transportation. Thus, many families have no first aid skills or rely on folk remedies or television to provide first aid instruction. Additionally, retention of first aid skills is poor and frequent skill reviews are essential to optimizing performance should these skills be needed. In order to reach this underserved population and boost retention of skills, programs are needed that allow families to learn skills on their own schedules, and review pertinent materials when needed. This project proposes to create a multimedia first aid training program for families that can be viewed in Internet/intranet, CD-ROM or DVD formats. The program will cover such basics as pediatric life support (relief of foreign body airway obstruction, rescue breathing, and CPR), controlling bleeding and shock, managing burns and other first aid emergencies. This program will train families in emergency response techniques that could potentially save lives and reduce the severity of outcome from childhood injuries. In Phase I, a prototype Internet-based program was developed for families of children of infants under one- year old. It covered Basic Life Support (BLS) skills as set forth by the American Heart Association. The efficacy of the Phase I program was tested in a 3-condition randomized controlled trial with 91 parents and found to be more effective than an in-person training program and significantly more effective than text-based programs. In Phase II the program will be expanded to include three age groups (i.e., less than 1, 1-8 years, and 9-12 years) and cover both CPR and first aid skills. The entire program will be evaluated in two randomized trials: (a) a large Internet-based  real-world  effectiveness evaluation, and (b) a replication study of the Phase I study, which compared the interactive multimedia program to a text-based program and to a teacher-led program, using direct observation assessment of CPR skills. Public Health Relevance: Unintentional injuries are the leading cause of death for children and infants under 14 years of age. Many of these deaths are preventable, in part by promoting injury prevention behaviors but also by administering effective emergency first aid techniques until advanced care arrives. This project proposes to create a multimedia first aid training program for families that can be viewed in Internet/intranet, CD-ROM or DVD formats, with the ultimate goal of providing life-saving skills to reduce the impact of unintentional pediatric injuries.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airway, affecting more than 20 million Americans. Without proper management it can be life-threatening. Children aged 0-17 have the highest prevalence of asthma, impacting an estimated 8.9 million children. Racial disparities exist in asthma prevalence for children; African- American children are (a) the most likely to suffer from asthma, (b) three times more likely to be hospitalized, and (c) four times more likely to die from asthma than Euro-American children. Children with asthma report higher incidences of asthma attacks, emergency room visits, and hospitalizations than adults; these are all indicators of uncontrolled asthma. Along with the burden of the disease, children with asthma are more likely to exhibit anxiety and stress disorders and have lower school performance than their non-asthmatic peers. Missed school and work days add to the financial burden of the disease for parents. The goal of this proposal is to create an asthma self-management skills training program for children and their parents in Internet/CD-ROM and DVD formats. This behaviorally based program will emphasize increasing: (a) knowledge regarding asthma and proper use of medications, (b) motivation to use prevention methods effectively, (c) self-efficacy in managing asthma, and (d) compliance with health care provider directions. Content will be based on clinical practice guidelines (NHLBI) and will include: (a) understanding asthma, (b) preventing asthma attacks, and (c) creating an asthma management plan. Materials in the child program will be tailored to the three largest racial/ethnic groups impacted by asthma (Euro-American, African- American and Hispanic) to increase relevance and efficacy, and intended for viewing with a parent. A separate and more detailed program for parents will be created with additional materials for schools and care providers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The potential benefits of this research to public health include improved understanding of cultural factors in pediatric asthma self-management, improved self-management skills for children, and better asthma management skills for their parents. This could result in eased suffering and improved quality of life for millions of children and their families, and also reduce the economic burden borne by society in the forms of medical expenditures and lost productivity.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Each year many children sustain sports and recreation-related concussions. Ineffective management of sports concussion can lead to development of post-concussive symptoms, second impact syndrome, and ongoing medical, psychological and cognitive problems. Recognition of concussive events is a key factor in prevention of more serious sequelae. This project will complete development of an Internet-based and theoretically grounded, interactive multimedia (IMM) training program on effective prevention and management of sports concussion among youth. In order to comprehensively address all the contexts in which sports concussion occurs, four programs will be developed targeting: (a) high schools, (b) middle schools, (c) elementary schools, and (d) community sports organizations. The programs will utilize a highly effective school-wide/organization-wide approach to the implementation of behavior-change interventions. Each of the four programs will be designed to have modules targeting: (a) coaches/athletics staff, (b) parents, (c) youth athletes, and (d) school and community administrators and staff. Delivered over the Internet, all four modules will provide interactive training in three key content areas: (a) information on incidence and mechanism of injury, (b) prevention strategies, and (c) effective concussion management. The program will be developed in collaboration with ImPACT, the leader in computerized cognitive assessment for professional, collegiate, and high school sports, and with top medical experts and researchers in the field of pediatric sports concussion. Specific content will be derived from guidelines set forth by the International Conference on Concussion in Sport and the National Athletic Trainers' Association and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). The efficacy of the program will be evaluated in a randomized trial with 3- month follow-up in 40 high schools from school districts in California, Oregon, Colorado, Kansas, and Virginia. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Nearly 3.8 million sports concussions occur every year, and researchers believe many more go unrecognized and unreported because of common misconceptions about head injury. Children and adolescents, with their developing brains, are particularly vulnerable. In response to this public health problem, the proposed Internet programs will train coaches, athletic staff, student athletes, parents, and school administrators how to recognize, respond to, and manage a sports concussion.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Depression is one of the most prevalent mental disorders to afflict adolescents. It seriously impacts role functioning and typically takes a recurrent or chronic course. There is also mounting evidence for familial transmission of depression. Because most depressed youth never receive treatment, there is a critical need to develop easily accessed prevention programs. This project will develop and test an interactive multimedia intervention aimed at preventing youth depression by teaching parents skills for intervening with their children. The program integrates two empirically validated approaches for intervening with youth using interactive multimedia technology: cognitive-behavioral skills training and parenting skills training techniques. An empirically tested framework will be adapted for self- administration via the Internet or CD-ROM. The intervention will consist of six knowledge- and skills-based intervention sessions: education about youth depression, mood and activity monitoring, positive thinking, pleasant activity engagement, linking mood and activities, and planning for the future. Additional browser (i.e., unrestricted access) modules will include: self-screening for depression, enhancing personal relationships, learning to relax, improving communication and problem-solving, depression resources, and parenting resources. The competency-based instructional design will be structured for multiple sessions using self-paced video-based tutorials, family member and peer testimonials, and behavior modeling vignettes. The program will be targeted to three user groups: single mothers, single fathers, and couples. The basic structure of the program will be the same for each target population, but specific content will be customized to each group. The Phase I prototype, targeted to single mothers of 11 to 14-year-olds reporting elevated depressive symptoms, provided training on understanding depression, monitoring mood, and engaging in pleasant activities. A within-subjects pre-post design tested the feasibility of the program in which participants were followed over a 1-week period. The results indicated significant pre-post change in parent knowledge and self- efficacy to use the skills taught as well as youth depressive symptomatology, mood, and pleasant activity engagement. Subjects found the program easy to use and gave it high user satisfaction ratings. The Phase II product will be evaluated in a large randomized trial (N = 320 parent-child dyads); participants will be followed over a three-month period. Results are expected to show increased parent knowledge of and self-efficacy for using the cognitive-behavioral skills taught as well as improvement in parenting skills; these changes in parent outcomes are expected to mediate the association between intervention condition and decreases in youth depressive symptomatology. The potential commercial applications of the Phase II product are to employee assistance programs, health plans, and disease management organizations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Depression is one of the most prevalent mental disorders among adolescents, however most go untreated. Parents play a significant role in their child's mental health yet lack access to support services and training programs. Given the evidence that cognitive-behavioral therapy and parenting skills training are both effective intervention strategies to help prevent youth depression, there is a critical need to develop a training program for parents incorporating these approaches that can be easily implemented and widely disseminated.",

While most individuals eventually adapt to their loss, 10-20% of the bereaved experience significant reactions including major depressive symptoms similar to post traumatic stress disorder. Moreover, bereavement can precipitate other health problems. With 4 million employees experiencing the loss of a loved one each year, the cost of bereavement to American business is over  44.5 billion in increased health utilization, absenteeism, reduced productivity (presenteeism), and errors/accidents due to poor concentration. The teaching of cognitive-behavioral coping skills shows promise as a method to decrease distress and promote social/occupational functioning. The proposed Web-based CBT intervention will integrate and operationalize prevailing grief theories in a cost-effective, multimedia bereavement support program. It will incorporate proven adult education and e-Learning instructional design principles with behavioral change theory to support employees following the death of a loved one. Access will be delivered over the Internet as an adjunct service of Employee Assistance Providers (EAP) and EAP Call Centers. It will tailor the presented materials according to the user's grief context: expectedness of the death, the nature of the death (traumatic vs. natural), and whether the relationship to the deceased was that of parent or older relative, spouse, adult child, sibling, friend, or coworker. Learning and personal support will be enhanced with tailored video testimonials/stories, as well as multimedia presentation of content and self-assessment tracking tools. The finished program will offer interactive exercises and activities to teach cognitive-behavioral coping skills that focus on: (a) personal grieving styles; (b) normal reactions to grief; (c) physical self-care; (d) cognitive-behavior coping strategies; (e) rumination; (f) reconstruction of meaning; and (g) reconstruction of identity without the deceased. In addition, the program will include modules to address specific needs and support of: (a) Human Resources Managers; (b) supervisors of bereaved employees; and (c) EAP and Call Center Counselors. The Phase I prototype program showed significant effects in a randomized trial on the Internet. The Phase II product will be developed for Internet or Intranet application accessible via standard web browsers and will be evaluated with a large randomized trial.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Circadian regulation of behavioral, metabolic, and endocrine function is a fundamental homeostatic process. Disruption of the circadian clock has been linked to sleep and psychiatric disorders at the genetic and molecular level. We initiated a discovery program in Phase I to identify ligands to a previously unexplored orphan receptor that directly interacts with the core circadian clock transcriptional loop. The receptor is expressed predominantly in the CNS and is especially prominent in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the hypothalamic region that provides master control of circadian function. The receptor has a role in the circadian cycle and in affective disorders based on the phenotype of the knockout mouse. A centrally-acting small molecule that is capable of shifting the phase of the SCN, or entraining and consolidating signals from the SCN, will have widespread therapeutic potential in circadian rhythm sleep disorders (CRSDs) such as delayed sleep phase disorder (DSPD), jet lag, shift work sleep disorder, and dementia, where disruption of sleep-wake patterns is of major economic and clinical significance. Melatonin and its analogues, which have soporific as well as circadian phase-shifting effects, are not widely used in these indications, primarily due to lack of efficacy. Light is beneficial as chronotherapy but presents practical problems with administration. There is considerable potential for a more efficacious chronotherapeutic. With Phase I support we developed the first screening assays, discovered hits, and identified a lead-like ligand that has good potency (EC50 200 nM), plasma stability (terminal half-life = 1 hour) and blood-brain barrier penetration (brain:plasma ratio = 1). Agonists and antagonists directly regulate the promoter of BMAL1, a core clock component, as predicted by molecular studies. We propose in Aim 1 to carry out final optimization of a lead for in vivo studies and to investigate pharmacological regulation of circadian cycling in isolated SCN to model potential in vivo effects. In Aim 2, we characterize circadian phase shifting by short-term exposure to ligand in mice free running on a 24 h period in the dark, a classic test of a potential chronotherapeutic. Based on these early findings, we test phase shifting protocols that might point to clinical utility, such as constant entrainment with respect to light for a sleep phase disorder, or acceleration of entrainment following a 6 h shift in the light-dark cycle resembling jet lag. In Aim 3, an optimized lead will be tested by chronic dosing in models of anxiety, depression, and psychosis. Current therapies for sleep and psychiatric disorders are inconsistent in their effectiveness. The project described herein offers the first opportunity to develop chronotherapeutic drugs to a novel target that has emerged from fundamental investigations of the circadian clock molecular mechanisms. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sleep disorders and mental illness affect up to 60 million Americans on an annual basis. The cost for treatment is  205 billion/year, accounting for 15% of annual U.S. healthcare costs. At the same time, current drugs are therapeutically inadequate for many patients and are based on small number of drug targets. The molecular components of the transcriptional clock that keeps the body's circadian time have been only recently recognized as having widespread involvement in sleep-wake disorders as well as dementia and perhaps mood and psychiatric disorders. Modulation of this transcriptional network could have a major impact in the area of CNS therapeutics.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The aim of this research is to develop an improved, synthetic bone graft material for use in dentistry. The loss of teeth is often accompanied by the loss of jaw bone. Restoring this lost bone is often a prerequisite for the installation of dental implants and the maintenance of normal facial features. Calcium sulfate works quite well as a bone regeneration material. It serves not only as a defect filler, but is also biocompatible, conducts new bone growth and encourages the growth of new blood vessels. However, its fast degradation is its major shortcoming, restricting its use in bone grafting applications. Based upon a successful phase I feasibility study, this project proposes the development of a new material: a calcium sulfate/absorbable polymer composite with superior biocompatibility and bone-compatibility and bone growth factor delivery capability. Phase I studies have already demonstrated that calcium sulfate/ absorbable polymer composites undergo slower degradation than pure calcium sulfate and thus overcomes a significant drawback of this material as a bone regeneration product. The plan now is to develop a product that dentists can use in bone grafting procedures that will rival the bone regeneration potential seen with the use of the patients' own harvested bone. The product, a composite of calcium sulfate and Poly DTE carbonate that delivers a bone growth factor, rhBMP-2, utilizes a new polymer whose in vivo bone response has been studied in several animal models. Because of its specific chemical structure, this polymer elicits an excellent cell and tissue response. Since an earlier version of this product has already been commercialized, this new product will be rapidly introduced to the marketplace as an improved replacement.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Bone grafting is an essential component of facial and dental maintenance. Recent concern about allograft bone supply makes the development of a reliable, affordable synthetic essential to this process. This project describes the development of just such a synthetic with bone regeneration capability rivaling autografts based on a simple, affordable material with a long safety history, calcium sulfate, combined with a new highly bone-compatible and biocompatible polymer and a bone growth factor.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): While numerous scientific studies that show impairments in olfactory function often represent an early and sensitive indicator of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) when used in conjunction with other clinical measures, there are no tests of olfactory function cleared by the FDA for this purpose. Consequently, the major goal of this application is comprised of two different but closely related components: 1.) to validate the use of the OLFACT  Test Battery as a sensitive, early indicator of mild cognitive impairment (MCI)/AD; and 2.) to use this data to seek and obtain FDA clearance of the OLFACT  Test Battery for use as a diagnostic test in the assessment of AD. To achieve this goal two specific goals are proposed. The first is to demonstrate that impairments in olfactory function--as ascertained by the OLFACT  Test Battery--are predictive of change in cognitive function and incidence of MCI with conversion to AD. To accomplish this, the Test Battery will be used to measure olfactory function in two longitudinal cohorts in which over 1500 participants are being evaluated for the development of MCI and AD. One cohort is from the Rush University Medical College Memory and Aging Project, the second is from the Massachusetts Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. This data will then form the basis for a 510(k) application to the FDA for the OLFACT  Test Battery. The availability of an FDA-cleared test as a valid and early predictor of AD would be of immense value, not only in the diagnosis of AD, per se, but also in assessing the efficacy of potential drug therapies or other therapeutic interventions as well as the development of future biomarkers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia in old age, with 4 to 5 million Americans currently affected, and sharp increases in those numbers are expected by mid-century with the aging of the U.S. population. Because of its devastating impact on cognition and other behaviors and its chronic course, the disease already poses substantial public health challenges, and these are likely to increase in the coming decades. Impairments in the sense of smell are one of the earliest indicators associated with the development of AD and FDA clearance of the OLFACT  Test Battery as a diagnostic test in the assessment of AD would provide both clinicians and researchers a powerful tool in the fight against this disease.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): More than 30 million Americans are exposed to hazardous sound levels on a regular basis. Of the 28 million Americans who have significant hearing loss, about one-third can be attributed, in part, to noise exposure. Availability of an effective treatment that prevents hearing loss in at-risk human populations would improve the quality of life for millions, and decrease healthcare costs for individuals, businesses, and government agencies. OtoMedicine Inc. has identified a proprietary combination of dietary supplements called AuraQuell , which is highly effective in preventing permanent noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) and sensory cell death in a guinea pig model. Research conducted during the Phase I SBIR demonstrated that AuraQuell  was also effective at reducing temporary hearing loss in the guinea pig. This is highly relevant, because for practical and ethical reasons clinical testing of the efficacy of AuraQuell  in humans will initially be conducted in subjects exposed to loud noise producing temporary NIHL. This Phase II SBIR will first establish a paradigm to reliably produce a temporary threshold shift (TTS) in subjects exposed to loud, but safe video-game shooting noise. The goal is to produce approximately a 10-15 decibel temporary hearing loss, which is sufficient to power a clinical trial. Once established, a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial will be conducted in 120 subjects to establish the efficacy of AuraQuell  to prevent TTS (temporary hearing loss). Gunfire noise was chosen because it is relevant to significant markets including the military and hunters. Data generated by this SBIR is critical to the successful commercialization of AuraQuell . In Phase III, OtoMedicine will petition the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (as specified in 21CFR 101.70) for a health claim and market AuraQuell  as a safe and efficacious preventative treatment for NIHL.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Approximately 28 million Americans have some degree of hearing loss; approximately one-third of which is the result of exposure to loud noise. This proposal will test a safe product that could be an effective treatment that reduces noise-induced hearing loss in at-risk human populations. This would improve the quality of life for millions, and decrease healthcare costs for individuals, businesses, and the military.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop and characterize a novel class of polymer matrix composite materials using a continuous NanoFiber Fused-Microfiber (Nf2-M) reinforcement technology. This patented approach, carbon nanofibers are grown in a continuous manner directly from the surface of continuous filaments (introduced in tow form) in a continuous, easily scaled process. Unlike traditional approaches which involve difficult mixing operations to introduce carbon nanofibers into the matrix resin at very low loading levels and with questionable dispersion, this approach produces continuous three-dimensional reinforcement networks which are easily incorporated into composites using standard fabrication techniques, including filament winding and prepreg wet lay-up processes. No additional or modified composite fabrication steps are needed. This technology has enormous potential for a multitude of commercial applications.  The broader/commercial impact of this project are threefold: 1) providing a foundation for a new technology in materials science research; 2) utilizing the fundamental findings to develop and engineer enabling materials to meet growing needs in industry for current and future applications; and 3) providing a low cost, commercially available, high performance carbon fiber reinforcement technology that has the potential to change the face of the composite materials industry. Global market forecast for reinforcing carbon fibers is ~$12.2 billion annually by 2011, and the approach of this project can take advantage of the multitude of existing markets, such as sporting goods, electronics, consumer products, commercial aerospace and automotive industries.",

This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase II project will create innovations in the science and application of polymer doping, fiber drawing, and bundling technology. Research will be conducted to shrink fiber diameter limits to submicron dimensions, to dramatically reduce diameter fluctuations, to increase pixel density, to increase array size, to reduce manufacturing time, and to improve array quality. Experiments will be performed to develop novel methods of doping polymer with higher concentrations of quantum dots and other nanoparticles. Additionally, a ribbon array cutting machine and a microwell fabrication apparatus will be developed. The current glass-based fiber optic technology is expensive, has limited functionality, and cannot be used in some applications. The company's proposed polymer products will be better replacements for current glass products, not only because of lower fabrication costs, but because of the increased functionality polymers provide, as well.  The innovations from this Phase II program will have significant scientific, technological, and social benefits. For example, in the fields of biological investigations, genomic studies, new pharmaceutical development, and detection of biological\nagents, polymer fiber optic arrays will increase the efficiency and integrity of high speed analyses for high throughput parallel experimentation. This program will also advance scientific understanding of the dynamics of Qdot and nanopartical dopants in polymers, providing fundamental benefits to the scientific literature for nonlinear optical polymer dynamics, as well as new methods to exploit quantum phenomena in mesoscopic devices.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multiplexing technologies have steadily gained in popularity in the fields of biology and biochemistry as the desire to perform higher-throughput and lower-cost reactions has increased. Optical multiplexing consists of attaching a known biological probe to a bead with a known optical code which allows the optical identification of each probe in the pooled sample by reading its unique optical code. In a subsequent step, the emission of a dye-labeled target is associated with the probe identity to determine the extent of the reaction in question. The two classes of materials currently used for optical multiplexing are fluorescent organic dyes and Quantum Dots but only lt100 optical codes are currently available commercially (e.g. from Luminex). For the Phase I effort we hypothesized that it would be possible to obtain far more resolvable optical codes if the broad emission from organic dyes (up to 30-60 nm at FWHM) were replaced with narrow emitters such as the rare earth elements which often display emission peak widths in the 2-10 nm range. In Phase II we demonstrated that it was possible to resolve up to a billion optical codes under ideal conditions by using known amounts of rare-earth-based Parallume materials which emit up to six colors for optical multiplexing. The advantages of this system over the current flow cytometer-based systems include: spectrally discrete emission from each of the emitters, a very high level of multiplexing available through the use of variable emitter concentrations, high quantum efficiency, excellent photostability, variable particle size, and a low cost, automated parallel synthesis. Very importantly, we have also developed a completely portable, battery-powered prototype bead reader (Multiplexed Assay Reader System, or  MARS ) with on superbright LEDs with an imaging system based on a very inexpensive commercial DSLR camera. In response to the specific Program Announcement, PA-08-115, for Competing Renewal applications for Complex Instrumentation under the auspices of the NHGRI, Parallel Synthesis proposes to build a complete late-stage prototype based on the Parallume platform consisting of the Parallume beads, the MARS hardware and software. Specifically, we propose to (1) develop an automated, parallel synthesis methodology for the Parallume beads to fulfill encoded set requirements, (2) create two automated, second-generation MARS prototypes and deliver them to collaborators for beta- testing resulting in feedback to create a final version of the prototype, (3) create a low-cost bead localization slide (BLS) for use in the MARS to enable high-density bead images, (4) complete a software package to control the MARS and analyze the data output from the MARS, also to be beta-tested along with the MARS, and (5) test the completely functional system by comparing our diagnostic assay for Chagas disease against a known diagnostic assay using Luminex. At the end of the three-year development period, Parallel Synthesis will have a fully functional G3 MARS with user- friendly software along with the BLS and encoded Parallume beads as consumables. This platform, offering a completely new technology for the fields of multiplex assay development and complex biological imaging and visualization, will be available for potential strategic partners, licensees, or for direct sale to end-users. This low cost system is ideally suited for low resource setting applications such as developing countries. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Assays used in both the developed countries and low resource settings would greatly benefit from reduced costs and increased throughput if it were possible to perform many reactions simultaneously. In order to process many pooled samples at once it is necessary to have a means of distinguishing the individual samples. This proposal describes a method by which each bead emits a unique optical signature upon excitation with a laser. The optical signature of each bead allows the determination of the bead's content and the extent of reaction during the assay. It is possible to resolve many thousands of optical codes by this method. Reading of the optical signatures by a portable detector/bead reader allows thousands of assays to be inexpensively performed and analyzed in parallel.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sjogren's syndrome (SS) is a slowly progressive inflammatory disease characterized by lymphocyte- mediated destruction of exocrine glands and internal organ involvement due to autoantibody production or pre- existing connective tissue disorder. Over time, progressive infiltration of lacrimal and salivary glands by mononuclear cells leads to diminished secretions, with resultant xerostomia (dry mouth) and xeropthalmia (dry eye) being the most prevalent symptoms. In Sjogren's patients, xerostomia leads to significant discomfort; interferes with activities such as speaking, chewing, and sleeping; and can result in numerous secondary clinical manifestations. Use of currently available treatments for xerostomia, including saliva substitutes and centrally acting parasympathomimetic secretagogues such as pilocarpine and cevimeline, provide transient relief, but patients often find these remedies costly, ineffective, inconvenient, and associated with uncomfortable side effects. Parion Sciences is developing 552-02, a novel epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) blocker, as a therapeutic for the indication of dry mouth. A 28-day, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover, safety study (205S) was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 552-02 formulated as an oral rise. In study 205S, the oromucosal formulation of 552-02 was safe and well tolerated when administered 6 times daily for 28 days to patients with dry mouth associated with Sjogren's syndrome. Despite the small sample size in this exploratory study (n=30), patients' assessments of changes from baseline in symptoms of dry mouth using visual analog scales indicated 552-02 efficacy for mouth dryness, tongue dryness, and the ability to sleep, and for overall symptoms of dry mouth (global assessment). Based on these results, Parion is continuing to develop its xerostomia program and is planning a follow-up Phase II study that will be optimized to increase efficacy and patient convenience. Specifically, the proposed study (207S) is powered for efficacy measures and includes an increase in concentration of 552-02 and new trial design. Study 207S is a necessary step in the overall development program for 552-02 as a novel therapy for treating the symptoms of dry mouth associated with Sjvogren's syndrome.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sjogren's syndrome is a disease that is, in part, characterized by severe dry mouth and dry eye. In Sjogren's patients, severe dry mouth leads to significant discomfort; interferes with activities such as speaking, chewing, and sleeping; and can result in other numerous disease conditions. Parion Sciences is developing a new drug that will be given as a mouth spray for the treatment of dry mouth associated with Sjogren's syndrome.",

        "abstract": "A muon collider with center of mass energy of 1.5-4 TeV would probe fundamental physics phenomena at energies well above the CERN Large Hadron Collider or the proposed International Linear Collider.  Unlike electrons, muons have sufficient mass to suffer negligible synchrotron radiation and can be circulated, thus decreasing the machine footprint and cost.  This project will develop high-field solenoids for the final cooling of muons in a collider.  In the Phase I design, the resistive coils were replaced by superconducting coils:  first a Nb3Sn coil operating below 2 K, and then a high temperature superconducting coil (either YBCO or Bi 2212).  Simulations conducted in Phase I demonstrated that the required ~25 pi mm-mrad emittance could be achieved with final-stage cooling in 50 T solenoids.  Phase II will build and test two insert coils:  (1) a 4 T coil using Bi-2212, and (2) a  ~12 T coil using YBCO.  One or both of the new coils would be tested inside a background field of 19 T.  In addition, the needed quench protection for these tests will be designed and constructed.  Finally, magnet and quench protection designs for 40-50 T systems will be studied. Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Beyond the application to high energy physics research, commercial applications include muon radiography for condensed matter studies, nanotechnology, medical applications (particularly for MRI magnets), and homeland-security applications",

        "abstract": "The Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) produces neutrons for neutron scattering studies that allow researchers to study key materials properties.  These neutrons are produced by the interaction of a very short (1 \u00c2\u00b5sec), highly intense (1 MW at 60 Hz) pulse of protons within a flowing bath of mercury, in a process that deposits a large amount of thermal energy in the mercury.  Because mercury has a high coefficient of thermal expansion, a high-amplitude (~38 MPa) short-duration (1 \u00c2\u00b5sec) pressure pulse is created, which causes erosion damage to the mercury target assembly, impacting SNS target lifetime and operating costs.  What is needed is a way to generate representative pressure pulses outside the SNS facility, in order to evaluate proposed erosion mitigation strategies.  This project will develop a facility, based on magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) pulse generation, capable of producing pressure pulses of similar magnitude and rise time to those experienced in the SNS.  In Phase I, a pilot-scale facility, capable of producing such pressure pulses and rise times, was developed.  The pressure pulses created in liquid mercury exceeded 1.4 MPa, with rise times under 5 \u00c2\u00b5s and a repetition rate greater than 0.4 Hz.  Phase II will design, fabricate, and characterize a 2nd-generation, full-scale current pulse generator that will accurately simulate the SNS target environment.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  In addition to providing immediate assistance to the SNS for the mitigation technology of erosion damage, the technology developed on this project should impact any system in which high-pressure, short-duration, and high pulse frequency impulses are present, including industrial applications involving water hammer and other flows that include cavitation",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the United States and atherosclerosis is its major cause. Based on statistics for aging population alone, a conservative prediction is there will be approximately 190,000 peripheral vascular procedures performed in 2020. This disease has significant adverse effects on the quality of life and survival, with mortality as high as 30% in 5 years and 50% in 10 years. A major component of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is obstruction of blood flow to the lower extremities from atherosclerosis. Of the arteries in the lower extremity, the superficial femoral artery (SFA) is the most commonly affected by PAD with over 50% of all PAD involving the SFA. Despite enthusiasm for drug-coated stents and atherectomy devices, there is no ideal endovascular solution to treating lower extremity occlusive disease, as they have not yet proven to be efficacious in the SFA and in some cases have performed worse than bare metal stents. Peritec Biosciences has developed a novel peritoneum lined stent (PLS) and unique delivery system. The PLS has shown excellent performance in animal and early human clinical studies. The PLS is attached to a self expandable stent which must be crimped and attached to the catheter at the time of surgery for deployment in the SFA. The unique tissue lined stent requires special handling in a novel delivery system developed by the company to maintain its physical and biological integrity. The existing PLS and delivery system is proficient in providing the stent for clinical application. But the process is time consuming, operator dependent, requires 4 to 6 minutes, and needs to be improved for clinical acceptance and commercial success. We have some unique and innovative crimping system concepts for the PLS that permits a safe, simple, and fast process for mounting it on a catheter in the clinical setting. In Phase I, 3-D models of stent crimping concepts for a tissue lined stent will be developed, constructed, and evaluated for key performance parameters using laboratory models. Based on the screening of potential crimping techniques defined in Phase I, in Phase II, the best system(s) will be identified. Prototypes will be constructed and stents will be crimped with the new system which will be evaluated in vitro and in vivo to demonstrate that the new crimping system has not compromised the physical or biological integrity of the PLS. We will successfully design a new crimping method for the current PLS delivery system that will decrease the preparation time in the surgical suite, be independent of operator skill, and require one half the current time to complete the steps prior to stent deployment. This will allow the use of the unique biocompatible PLS to meet a serious and growing unmet need in the treatment of vascular atherosclerosis in the lower extremities.",

Building on the Phase I results, which demonstrated the fundamental concepts of thermal actuation of microfluidics, the goals of the Phase II program are to demonstrate, develop, and optimize thermal actuation techniques for all useful microfluidic fluid handling functions, and to demonstrate the ability to combine the various functions into an integrated device. To achieve these goals, methods will be developed for fabricating, operating, evaluating, and optimizing devices demonstrating each function of interest in a realistic application setting. The end result will be a complete microfluidic tool box that can be applied to supply fluid handling and control functions to a variety of customers for implementation in commercial microfluidic devices.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Many human diseases-if not all human diseases-and human health appear to be linked to our genetics. Major government and private research efforts are focused on investigating this linkage. Unfortunately, one of our best tools for this critical work-i.e., microarrays-holds us back, as most provide only generally qualitative results, limiting their usefulness. One key example is single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) detection. Current SNP analysis is not quantitative because of imperfect molecular recognition (cross-hybridization) and pseudoequilibrium analyses performed with microarrays, limiting their use (e.g., to preliminary screening, as with the Affymetrix SNPChip). The microarray techniques attempt to compensate via excessive redundancy, leading to massive quantities of inaccurate/irreproducible data. The need to sort through these copious amounts of data extends analysis time, leads to improper conclusions, initiates scientific controversy, and may misdirect diagnostic and pharmaceutical research. Fortunately, these outcomes can be improved upon-which is the primary goal of the multi-phase STTR Fast-Track project proposed here. One key task that requires next-generation tools for real-time, reliable, quantitative SNPs analysis-including new data-management/analysis capabilities and simple yet powerful chemistries-is heteroplasmy (semiquantitative mitochondrial DNA SNP assays). Heteroplasmy could fulfill a major unmet need for reliable/costefficient quantitative tests involving cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, hypertension and a variety of neuromuscular, neurodegenerative, and metabolic diseases. Our goal is to develop, prototype, and commercialize real-time and quantitative heteroplasmy research tools based on technology licensed from the U of Utah and developed by Sigma founders. Preliminary data using our proprietary  competitive displacement analysis  (CDA)-the key innovation-strongly indicates the potential for successful development and rapid commercialization under this Fast-Track project. Specifically, we propose to develop our new method of performing real-time SNP microarray analysis (via CDA) by monitoring non-linear binding kinetics of known competitors in the presence of unlabeled targets. Our Phase I Aims are to 1) Demonstrate relevant binding kinetics; 2) Prove/validate feasibility of using CDA for heteroplasmy-based SNP detection in a model system; and 3) Develop CDA-based analytical approaches for multi-component model systems, based on synthetic targets, competitors, and lower-affinity species (background). Meeting the key Phase I milestones will allow us to pursue Phase II Aims: 4) Characterize CDA for heteroplasmy analysis on A3243G mutation locus; 5) Scale up CDA to interrogate multiple mutations; and 6) Complete comparative validation of CDA versus reference methods. Phase II success will provide the data needed to attract  Phase III  industry and financial partners. This will facilitate rapid product introduction into a key niche in a multi-billion-dollar research/diagnostics industry that benefits human health worldwide.",

Thus, phosphors that could efficiently up-convert IR radiation to visible light would have a significant impact on lamp efficiency and design.  This project will develop technology to increase the efficiency of upconversion phosphors by more than an order of magnitude:  from ~ 5% to 60% or higher.  Phase I demonstrated, both experimentally and theoretically, that an upconverting nanophosphor could improve up-conversion efficiency by a factor of 4 (experiment) or by a factor greater than 10 (theory) compared to conventional particles.  In these nanostructures, both the sensitizer and activator doping were confined to two-dimensioal layers, thus dramatically enhancing upconversion efficiency while simultaneously reducing sensitizer-defect interactions.  In Phase II, these nanostructured materials will be encapsulated to achieve enhanced performance that is close to the maximum theoretical efficiency.  Unwanted radiative losses will be inhibited by incorporating these structures into Bragg resonator or photonic crystal structures.  Finally, a low-cost, high-volume, automated manufacturing process will be developed. Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The nanophosphors should have applicability to all existing lamp products, including incandescent, tungsten-halogen, and all types of fluorescents lamps.

This project will develop a carbon-fiber-reinforced silicon carbide matrix composite system that retains its strength above 1000\u00c2\u00b0C and has helium permeability less than 10-9m2/s.  Nanophase materials used in the matrix will minimize porosity without sacrificing strength or high temperature performance.  In Phase I, the permeation of gas through a silicon-carbide-based ceramic composite was reduced by more than two orders of magnitude by adding a combination of oxides to the composite matrix.  The oxides reacted during processing with the composite matrix to fill pores and gaps, thereby reducing the ability of both air and helium to flow through the matrix.  It was shown that the permeability can be reduced to 10-9m2/s, comparable to the best silicon carbide composite materials available.  In Phase II, the processing of the matrix additives will be improved to further reduce gas permeability through the carbon-fiber-reinforced silicon carbide composites.  In addition, it will be shown that complex assemblies can be fabricated using these materials, with the strength and gas permeability of joints comparable to the composite system.

Then, an optical interferometer instrument system will be designed and constructed, including the OP-GaAs, and the instrument will be tested in a DIII-D fusion reactor.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  NLO OP-GaAs components should find use in markets for frequency-converter optical devices, including those with second harmonic generation, optical parametric generation, and similar functionality.  NLO OP-GaAs for laser conversion also should see market demand within optical systems for DOD applications and for DOE applications such as diagnostic tools for plasma fusion reactors",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal addresses a need for an improved technology for both diagnosis and treatment of patients with cystic neoplasms of the pancreas. Currently, endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) technology is used as a first line of diagnosis for pancreatic lesions. However, the complex regional anatomy of the pancreas and the very difficult differentiation between various cystic lesions make the diagnosis of pancreatic cysts in general and the distinction between benign and malignant cysts in particular difficult without surgical resection. Physical Sciences Inc. (PSI) has developed a technology that shows promise for increasing the diagnostic accuracy of the EUS-FNA procedures. In addition to cytopathological analysis, the clinician and pathologist will also benefit from the availability of high-resolution optical coherence tomography (OCT) images showing the in-situ morphology of the cyst lining. These images will be taken with a catheter that can be launched through the existing EUS needle. This technology can also provide a non-surgical therapeutic option for early stage lesions or for patients that are not surgical candidates. A therapeutic beam can be sent through the same OCT imaging catheter to thermally coagulate (necrose) the cyst epithelial lining. With the laser therapy and OCT imaging combined, the dual capability system has the potential for performing both diagnosis and real-time monitored therapy at the micron scale. None of these features are currently available to the physician. In Phase I a pre-clinical system was developed and a pilot in vitro clinical study on pancreatic tissue specimens was conducted to demonstrate the capability of the system for differentiating between cystic lesions (benign versus malignant and serous versus mucinous). Over 90% differentiation accuracy was obtained in this study. Real-time monitored thermal coagulation of pancreatic cysts was demonstrated as well. To the best of our knowledge, this is the most detailed OCT study on pancreatic lesions ever reported. The Phase II program will focus on the development of an advanced clinical prototype and imaging/therapy probe suitable for in vivo use, on conducting a pilot study on human patients to test the in vivo efficacy of OCT for cystic lesions differentiation, and on conducting a clinical study on animals to determine the in vivo efficacy of OCT monitored laser therapy. These studies will be performed at the Massachusets General Hospital, gastroenterology and animal facility suites. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research could substantially improve cancer diagnosis and therapy surveillance, allowing for detection at an early stage when it is treatable and potentially curable. It could also offer a potential therapeutic capability that might reduce the number of surgical interventions. It is evident that earlier diagnosis and therapy result in an improved outcome, decreased morbidity and reduced mortality from disease.",

This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will continue development of the Tube-Clear(TM) device to clear clogged and sluggish feeding tubes, satisfying a critical medical need and reaching a viable commercial market.  When compromised patients are unable to swallow food or medication, feeding tubes are used to administer medication and nutrition.  A clog leaves the patient without medication or nutrition for hours, or even days, and is extremely frustrating to both patient and caregiver.  Approximately 410,000 PEG (long-term) tubes and 5 million NG (short-term) tubes are placed each year in the U.S.  Each type of tube presents specific challenges for feeding, clogging and cleaning. The Tube-Clear(TM) PEG prototype cleaned a clog of food and ground medication, in less than one minute, that could not be easily removed using any other available approach.  Demonstration of the PEG alpha-prototype at four focus groups, for over 20 nurses from a variety of clinical settings, produced an overwhelmingly positive response toward the device. Phase II (following on Phase IB) will further develop both the PEG tube and NG tube cleaners to beta-prototypes, take the devices through clinical trials, and establish manufacturing protocols, all under a Food and Drug Administration compliant quality system.  The Tube-Clear will ease the burden on nursing staff and patients dealing with the frustration of clogged and sluggish feeding tubes.  A structured financial and technical plan has been put in place using a combination of funds from SBIR (Phase I, IB, II and IIB), the\nState of Pennsylvania, Commercial Partners, and equity investment to reach specific milestones over a 2.5 year period. The NSF Phase I project kicked off this development effort with a highly successfully Alpha prototype for PEG tubes, which was tested in a series of nursing focus groups, resulting in extremely positive reviews.  The Tube-Clear for PEG cleaning has an anticipated market launch date in 2010, followed by a NG tube cleaning device market launch in 2011.  By 2013, Piezo Resonance Innovations (PRII) anticipates revenue for the Tube-Clear (TM) of $25-50 Million.  Three commercial partners, with presence in the enteral feeding market, have indicated strong interest in the device and would provide access to their paths to market, marketing staff, and device development expertise.  They have also expressed willingness to contribute financially, potentially as Phase IIB partners.  PRII staff will also teach guest lectures on medical device design in the Penn State School of Nursing.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although there are strain rate imaging products on the market today, none are able to provide real-time, regionally-specific, quantitative measurements of myocardium mechanics in multiple dimensions. Doppler- based strain rate imaging (SRI) implementations compromise image quality in order to provide adequate signal to noise ratio strain rate images. In addition, accuracy of Doppler-based measurements suffers from angle dependency. Other current SRI implementations process stored B-mode data to track image speckle and other features to eliminate angle dependency issues; however, accuracy is limited since these methods only use amplitude data, and low frame acquisition rates can cause poor feature tracking. Pixel Velocity Inc. has developed a technology which overcomes these limitations and is capable of producing accurate, regional, quantitative measurements of heart dynamics and mechanics. During NIH-funded Phase I and Phase II SBIR grants, Pixel Velocity Inc., in collaboration with The University of Michigan Health System, University of Michigan Biomedical Engineering Department and WinProbe Corporation, built a prototype of the real-time two-dimensional strain rate imaging ultrasound and demonstrated the performance of the system via a 20-patient human feasibility study. During the Phase II Competing Renewal project Pixel Velocity, The University of Michigan Health System and Regulatory Affairs Associates will seek FDA approval for the real-time, two-dimensional strain rate imaging system. This work includes establishing the necessary quality management system, conducting a series of clinical trials designed to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of Pixel's strain rate imaging technology, and submitting the associated FDA 510(k) applications for approval. The successful result will be FDA approval to market the Pixel Velocity real-time, two-dimensional strain rate imaging technology to quantitatively measure regional myocardium mechanical function, providing diagnostic information for selecting and guiding cardiac therapy. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A primary goal of clinical cardiology is assessment of heart muscle function. In particular, regional evaluation of myocardium expansion and contraction, or contractility, provides critical diagnostic and therapeutic information. Pixel Velocity's real-time, two-dimensional strain rate imaging system will offer cardiologists fast and accurate means to quantify regional myocardium mechanical function, enabling cardiologists to improve diagnosis, treatment, and risk stratification of patients with coronary artery disease.",

        "abstract": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).  This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the need for crops with increased yield. Yield is directly related to nitrogen (N) utilization and is dramatically affected by climate. Plant Sensory Systems has developed a genetic modification to plants that increases their N use efficiency (NUE) and tolerance to drought and high temperatures. The modification is the insertion of a novel pathway for making gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in plants. Phase I research demonstrated that the genetically modified model plants were more drought- and heat tolerant and had higher yield in both N-limited and N-sufficient conditions compared to wildtype plants. In Phase II the gene construct will be tested in a crop plant to demonstrate commercial feasibility. Agronomic performance in N- and water-limited and sufficient conditions will be determined in homozygote corn lines.  The broader impacts of this research are the stabilization of the agronomic sector of the economy and a reduction in adverse effects of agriculture on the environment. The innovation would lead to crops with higher yields that cost less to produce. The need for less N fertilizer would reduce costs to the growers and have significant environmental savings by reducing the amount of N that runs into the watershed. Moreover, a reduction in fertilizer production and application would reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The innovation confers tolerance to climate changes, which would also reduce crop-production costs and increase yield. The proposed technology has great commercial potential in a market actively seeking increased NUE and value-added traits.",

        "abstract": "The biodiesel industry is growing rapidly in the U.S. and is expected to continue growing.  However, even if all oilseeds produced in the U.S. were used for biodiesel, the supply would still fall short of the nation\u00c2\u00bfs need.  Moreover, as the biodiesel market increases, food prices are expected to increase due to the efflux of seeds into the expanded biofuel market.  Thus, an increase in seed oil content is needed to increase crop productivity per acre, in order to better meet the biodiesel demand.  This project will employ a molecular approach to enhance seed oil content by inserting a novel gene in oilseed plants to direct the carbon flow into oil biosynthesis.  In Phase I, the technology was tested in the plant model system, Arabidopsis.  It was demonstrated that the seed oil content was 7 to 36% higher in the transgenic lines compared to the normal (or wildtype) line.  Moreover, yield and seed viability were unaffected in the transgenic lines.  In Phase II, the gene construct will be moved into a crop plant, canola, to demonstrate commercialization potential.  Analyses will be performed to determine the quantity and quality of the seed oil content in the transgenic canola compared to that found in wildtype canola.  Yield and seed viability also will be determined. Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Once demonstrated in a crop plant, the technology would be marketed to agribusinesses in the form of licensing agreements.  Oilseeds with higher oil content would increase oilseed crop productivity per acre and help establish a thriving biodiesel market.  Increased oilseed production would stimulate local and regional economies by increasing farming profit and creating new jobs.",

        "abstract": "Tungsten\u00c2\u00bfs inherent chemical inertness and high melting temperature make it an ideal heat sink and armor material for fusion applications.  However, tungsten\u00c2\u00bfs intrinsic low temperature brittleness makes it difficult to fabricate using conventional processing techniques.  Recently, advanced electrochemical forming techniques based on microalloying and grain refinement have been developed that enable the near-net-shape fabrication of tungsten components.  Based on these results, this project will develop near-net-shape, electrochemical processing techniques for the fabrication of fine-grain tungsten alloys for use in fusion devices.  By proper selection of the alloying elements and processing parameters, it may be possible to tailor a tungsten alloy that resists grain growth, has improved strength and ductility, possesses good thermal conductivity, and is resistant to transmutation.  During Phase I, the ability of electrochemical processing parameters to control the microstructure of deposits was evaluated, along with the ability to produce tungsten alloys.  Preliminary microstructural analysis and testing verified that structural and properties improvements are possible using these techniques.  During Phase II, the process will be optimized with respect to the electrochemical processing parameters and the amount of alloying additions.  The optimized process will then be used to produce an advanced tungsten alloy heat sink, which will be high-heat-flux tested and compared to pure tungsten heat sinks. Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The near-net-shape forming of tungsten alloys with improved ductility and mechanical properties has tremendous commercial potential.  Aside from nuclear fusion applications, electrochemical microalloyed tungsten should be applicable to non-eroding nozzles in rocket engines, crucibles for crystal growth, heat pipes, welding electrodes, x-ray targets, warhead penetrators, radiation/temperature shielding applications, and other high temperature furnace components.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent scientific investigations have shown that plastics often leach endocrine disruptor chemicals (EDCs) into the environment. EDCs interfere in various ways with hormones, most commonly estrogens or next-most commonly androgens, and can have significant adverse effects on many behavioral and physiological processes such as sperm counts, uterine and ovarian functions, aggressive behaviors, and sexual orientation. ED effects (agonistic or antagonistic) sometimes occur at very low (picomolar to nanomolar) concentrations, especially on fetal or developing mammals (including humans). The prevalence of EDCs in current polymer formulations and their biological effects warrant the development of plastic products free of estrogenic (EA) and androgenic (AnA) activity, especially for plastics used to package foodstuffs or to make baby products. In order to meet this need, Plastipure (PPi) is submitting a Phase II SBIR grant to develop for commercialization polymer formulations to make plastics that do not release chemicals having EA and AnA but that still possess many advantageous characteristics, such as microwavability, resistance to UV light and moisture and physical properties similar to current commercially available formulations. PPi proposes to confirm that PPi's EA-Free formulations are also AnA-Free and have equivalent physical properties and thermal stability as compared to current commercial formulations. Secondly, PPi plans to identify a set of EA- and AnA-Free chemicals (e.g. colorants, clarifiers and antistats) that could be incorporated during the conversion or finishing processes that could be used with our resins to produce EA-Free and AnA-Free products. Finally, PPi plans to develop at least one next-generation EA-Free and AnA-Free PE or PP which utilize antioxidants and other additives that do not contain chemical moieties that could degrade or otherwise react to produce chemicals which exhibit EA or AnA. If these Phase II development studies are successful, PPi should have the only known formulations that can make a wide variety of plastic products that do not leach chemicals having EA or AnA. These formulations would then be licensed to plastic manufacturers who would then produce EA-Free and AnA-Free consumer products, such as food containers and baby bottles. Given the increasing concern of individuals for their and their children's well-being and PPi's requests from large and small retail firms, EA-Free and AnA-Free plastic products should have high commercial potential. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent scientific investigations have shown that many chemicals used to manufacture plastics leach into the environment and are endocrine disruptor chemicals (EDCs) that most commonly exhibit estrogenic activity (EA) or next-most commonly exhibit androgenic activity (AnA). EDCs having EA and/or AnA cause various disorders such as uterine dysfunction or reduced sperm count and abnormal brain maturation leading to pathologies such as learning disabilities, disorders of attention, motivation, emotion, cognitive development, and changes in aggressive behavior and sexual orientation. Given such adverse effects of EDCs having EA and AnA on mammals (including humans); there is high scientific, societal, and commercial merit for PPi to develop EA-Free and AnA-Free plastic formulations, especially for food packaging and baby products.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Two important advances in the treatment of renal cancer are gaining acceptance; partial nephrectomy is replacing radical nephrectomy for preserving functioning renal tissue, and minimally invasive surgery is replacing open partial nephrectomy. For both, control of intra-operative renal bleeding is essential. Pluromed has developed a family of Rapid Transition Polymers  (RTPs ), reverse thermosensitive polymers which are liquid at low temperatures and rapidly transition to gel as they warm to body temperature. The aqueous polymer is reversible back to a liquid via cooling and is dissolvable. The Company has developed a new RTP, LeGoo-XL , and a technique, Perfusive Hemostasis , which are used to achieve superior hemostasis during partial nephrectomy. By injecting LeGoo-XL into a segmental branch of the renal artery, blood flow is reversibly interrupted to that renal segment destined for resection while normal flow is maintained to uninvolved s commercialization by performing all of the pre-clinical development required in anticipation of a subsequent clinical trial supporting FDA approval. This includes validation and extension of Phase I results, a comparison of LeGoo-XL to standard arterial clamping techniques, an assessment of the safety and biocompatibility of the polymer, and development of a market-ready injection system. Acute and chronic experiments in pigs and calves will be performed. The Specific Aims of this project are: 1. To verify and extend Phase I results in an acute pig study; 2. To compare LeGoo-XL to renal artery clamping in acute and chronic pigs; 3. To study pathology in 6 week survival pigs; 4. To extend results to a second and larger animal model in an acute calf study; 5. To characterize the biocompatibility, toxicity and physiochemistry of LeGoo-XL; 6. To develop a market-ready angiographic injector and system 7. To develop an alternative direct renal artery injection technique upon completion ofinimally invasive techniques in this approach by offering superior hemostasis and allowing surgery on one section of the kidney while maintaining normal flow to the remaining renal tissue. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Surgically removing only the morbid part of a diseased kidney instead of removing the entire kidney, nephron- sparing surgery, is beneficial for long-term kidney function. The technical hurdles limiting the adoption of this approach are the ability to control bleeding during the surgery and the need to reduce warm ischemia time. A bloodless field is vital to the success of minimally invasive techniques. LeGoo-XL offers superior hemostasis and the ability to temporarily interrupt flow only to that renal segment destined for resection. This approach has the capability to make the surgeon's job easier and the partial nephrectomy procedure shorter while leading to better renal function and outcomes. It has the potential to enable greater adoption of both the partial nephrectomy approach and the use of minimally invasive techniques in this approach.",

However, its safety problems related to thermal runaways are delaying the introduction of lithium-ion batteries into large format systems such as hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs).  One of the concerns is the possibility of an internal short-circuit caused by the shrinkage of the separator at high temperatures.

In effect, results of Phase I and post-Phase I studies demonstrated the conceptual viability of using amphiphilic, segmented, polyether-esters for designing macromolecular chains comprising polyethylene glycol or (polyethylene glycol-ran-propylene glycol) end-grafted with cyclic monomers to produce two major types of fiber-forming copolymers having distinctly different ranges of absorption and breaking strength retention (BSR) profiles when evaluated as monofilament sutures. More specifically, the first type consists of polyether-esters comprising high glycolide-based sequences (USG-type) and the respective monofilaments and braided multifilaments exhibit brief BSR profiles and a complete mass loss in less than three months. Meanwhile, the second type consists of polyether-esters comprising high l-lactide-based sequences (USL-type) and the respective monofilaments exhibit relatively prolonged BSR and mass loss profiles compared to those of the USG-type. One of the USG and USL types are selected as viable candidates for development in Phase II. Hence, Phase II objective is to develop two specific types of swellable monofilament sutures, a relatively fast-absorbing USG-type suture for use primarily in plastic and urinogenital surgeries, and slow-absorbing USL-type sutures for application in general and vascular surgeries, and define the merits of extending the swellable monofilament technology to the development of multifilament medical constructs. And Phase II plans entail (1) completing the development and optimization studies of the selected USG and USL polymers and associated process validation; (2) optimizing and validating the processes for monofilament production and coating; (3) completing non-GLP comprehensive in vitro and in vivo studies on different sizes of both suture types; (4) initiating the scale-up, safety, and stability studies; (5) securing a marketing partner to collaborate with Poly-Med in planning Phase III study; and (6) completing focused in vitro and/or in vivo studies on selected multifilament braided sutures.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): LMWHs are being used with greater frequency to treat deep vein thrombosis, unstable angina, and acute pulmonary embolism, as well as thromboprophylaxis agents in a wide range of clinical situations including orthopedic surgery, high risk pregnancy, and cancer therapy. The most common complication of anticoagulation with LMWHs is hemorrhage. Many published clinical studies report 1% to 4% major (life-threatening) bleeding associated with LMWH therapy and there is a 5-fold increase in the overall death rate for acute coronary syndrome patients receiving anti- coagulant therapy that experience major bleeding. Although protamine is commonly used to neutralize UFH following coronary bypass surgery, it is unable to completely reverse the anticoagulant effects of LMWHs or fondaparinux. Therefore, there is a strong medical need for the development of a safe and effective antagonist for the LMWHs. The goal would be to develop an antidote that could rapidly reverse unwanted bleeding yet permit rapid resumption of anticoagulation therapy with a new dose of LMWH to restore thromboprophylaxis. We are developing series of non-peptidic oligomers with well-defined secondary or tertiary structures to serve as novel templates for the design of compounds targeting specific protein- protein and protein-membrane interactions. These oligomers have many advantages over peptides: relatively smaller size which increases stability and enhances tissue distribution, ease of synthesis, resistance to proteolytic degradation, and suitability for medicinal chemistry approaches to fine-tune their physical properties and optimize potency and safety. We have utilized this strategy to design small oligomers that strongly interact with UFH and LMWH and antagonize their anti-coagulation properties. We propose to evaluate the suitability of current lead compounds as antagonists to LMWH and fondaparinux in preclinical efficacy and safety studies designed to identify clinical candidates. In addition, we propose to continue medicinal chemistry efforts in the salicylamide series and a newer series of arylamides to identify back-up compounds to substitute into the discovery program if problems are encountered with the current lead compounds. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) and the pentasaccharide, fondaparinux, are widely used anti-coagulants employed in a number of clinical and surgical applications. Bleeding complications are common adverse events associated with anti-coagulant therapy. Protamine is an effective antagonist of UFH but presently there are no effective antagonists for the pentasaccharide or the low molecular weight heparins. We are developing safe and effective non-peptidic oligomers to neutralize the anti-coagulation properties of LMWH and fondaparinux.",

The technology includes a  Skin and Bone Integrated Pylon  (SBIP), which connects the residuum with an external limb prosthesis. As histopathology analysis has demonstrated, the SBIP will be integrated not only with the residual bone, but also with the residuum's skin in order to minimize the risk of infection and secondary trauma. During the proposed Phase II study the investigators will develop an optimal porous titanium matrix and design of the Skin and Bone Integrated Pylon to maximize the ingrowth of bone and skin cells of the residuum to the SBIP. The mathematical modeling and mechanical testing will be followed by a technological study on the process of manufacturing of the composite porous structure enforced with a permeable internal frame. A pre-clinical study with rodent and non-rodent animals will be conducted to verify the scientific hypotheses and to select the optimal design of the SBIP. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Inadequate prosthetic rehabilitation after limb amputation is a serious problem relevant to public health. The public value of solving this serious problem is much more elevated when a country is at war. Providing US Veterans with infection-safe direct skeletal attachment of prostheses will improve the quality of their lives and eliminate the costs associated with the multiple fabrications and adjustments of the prosthetic sockets.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Drug doses released by 'inhalation aerosol delivery devices' (or inhalers) need to be analyzed regularly. The conventional technology for such analysis involves collection of aerosols in various size intervals and preparation of their solutions for HPLC analysis (i.e. liquid-phase chemical analysis), which is labor intensive and time consuming and has a high operating cost. The use of liquid phase makes the analytical process complex and slow in the conventional arrangement. This project aims at developing a fast and automated analyzer for inhaler doses. The proposed system will use electrical/optical measurements of the collected dry powder, in order to fully characterize inhaler doses, i.e. determine distribution of the mass of drug in various aerosol size intervals, and validate the identity of the collected drug. Further, state of crystallinity will be characterized. In the case of a combination drug, the proposed analyzer will quantify ratio of the component drugs. The proposed technique would also enable analysis of the drug released by a single actuation of an inhaler (as preferred by FDA Guidance on analysis of inhaler doses), as opposed to multiple actuations often needed with the conventional approach. This project brings together the resources of a small high-tech business with a major pharmaceutical company, a medium-size pharmaceutical instrumentation company and a university laboratory. Prototype instruments based on the new and innovative approaches will be built for inhaler dose analysis and tested extensively in industrial RandD and production environments. Shortly after completion of this SBIR Phase II project, two products based on the proposed technologies should become commercially available. Market size for these products in 2020 is estimated to be  28M/year and would be growing at least 5% annually. The proposed work would help improve the health of the people by supporting the treatment of respiratory diseases, and possibly lung cancer in the future. Availability of the proposed instrumentation would enable enhanced safety and efficacy of inhalation drug delivery devices. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This SBIR Phase II project deals with the analysis of inhaler doses. The proposed approach analyzes the inhaler doses in the form of powder and is promising for high-speed and fully automated measurements. By the end of this project, we expect to have prototypes built and tested in the industrial RandD and manufacturing environments.",

        "abstract": "Zero-emission power generation, via an economical carbon capture and storage (CCS) process, offers a sustainable future for coal-derived fuels.  Successful oxy-fuel combustion technology is a candidate for satisfying this objective, provided that the cycle efficiency can be boosted to levels that are equal to or greater than that of other fossil fuel power generating cycles.  In order to achieve this increase in cycle efficiency, a robust reheat combustor, capable of driving the working fluid temperature up to 1760C, will be required.  However, no existing re-heat combustor design can operate in the harsh steam/CO2 environment expected in the cycle.  This project will utlize a novel injector for oxy-syngas reheat combustion.  This technology offers the potential to be simple, robust and cost-effective as a reheat combustor for the high temperature working fluid of an intermediate-pressure steam/CO2 turbine, thus enabling higher cycle efficiencies.  Phase I used Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) and kinetics modeling to demonstrate the proof-of-concept.  In Phase II, a subscale module will be fabricated and tested to demonstrate stable combustion and low emission performance.  An optimized single injector module will be fabricated for testing at a high pressure/temperature test facility at simulated engine conditions. Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The reheat combustor should become a major component for the development of zero-emissions technology for coal combustion.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to build upon the feasibility of using MIMS technology to determine the presence and measure the concentration of multiple protein biomarkers (specifically autoantibodies) within a single sample. In order to achieve our primary objective in Phase II, PHB proposes to produce a new highly-sensitive and stable MIMS system prototype for clinical use. We will develop a prototype disposable, reliable, easy to use biochip cassette with limited potential for biohazard exposure. To reduce the need for off-chip processing, PHB will implement a cartridge- based fluidic channel to remove blood cells. We will develop specific attachment strategies for antibodies and/or F(ab)2 fragments of antibodies that enable the efficient capture of antigens to be used as targets for autoantibodies. This will eventually lead to the development of reverse capture arrays for identification of autoantigens against which autoAb expression may be used to differentiate between normal and disease states. We will optimize the protein printing methodology, and blocking protocols to enable the optical interference detection system to provide reproducible results in molecular binding reactions on a multiplicity of nanostructured protein chips. We will evaluate the performance of the optimized substrate and platform in real-time with a representative set of antibody targets. Our initial focus will be a panel consisting of Thyroperoxidase antibody, TSH receptor antibodies and\nthyroglobulin antibodies.  These tests can potentially be used to diagnose an autoimmune thyroid disease and to separate it from other forms of thyroiditis.  The broader impacts of this research are to develop the Molecular Interaction Measurement System (MIMS) which has the potential to measure multiple analyte types (protein, RNA, DNA etc.) in real-time. MIMS uses optical interference to measure the changes in thickness, resulting from binding of a ligand to a macromolecule attached to the surface of a detector chip. The array format of the MIMS assay permits simultaneous detection of the binding of multiple analytes. One application of interest and immediate clinical value is in the detection of autoantibodies which target host tissue and mediate autoimmune diseases. MIMS can enable specific detection without having to tag (e.g. with radioisotope or fluorescence) a patients sample: resulting in more accurate and cost effective diagnoses In addition, the finding that patients with cancer produce autoantibodies against antigens in their tumors suggests that such autoantibodies could have both diagnostic and prognostic value. Commercially, MIMS can be a tool to easily, rapidly and cost effectively screen a large number of patients with different types and stages of cancer and other diseases providing value to clinicians, to patients and the clinical research community.",

Flow cytometry is the standard method of cell counting, but the majority of the 30 to 40 million infected people worldwide are in resource-limited areas and do not have access to these measurements. As a direct alternative, this project is developing a compact, low cost imaging instrument for HIV-related cell counting with a projected instrument cost of approximately  100. Through the Phase I grant and related funding, a prototype instrument and disposable cartridge for CD4 cell counting have been developed. Demonstrations with labeled cells were successful, and completion of a low cost instrument for absolute counts of helper T cells (CD4+) is on schedule for late 2009 - early 2010. This Phase II proposal describes plans to improve and expand the capabilities of the progress already achieved. Simple cartridge mechanics will significantly increase the total field of view, resulting in more cells being counted and better statistical accuracy. In addition to identifying CD4+ T cells, reagents and methods for counting cytotoxic T cells, B cells, monocytes, and lymphocytes will be tested and demonstrated with clinical samples. Reagents and surface coatings will be developed to allow simple sample preparation, without the repeated centrifugation associated with current flow cytometer methods of cell lysis, washing and staining. Clinical characterization of the instrument will be performed, providing feedback on the design and performance. At the conclusion of Phase II, a fieldable prototype instrument, cartridge, and procedure will be available for HIV-related cell counting with results that are comparable to current flow cytometry methods, and with a capital cost that is reduced by approximately 100-fold or more. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Accurate counts of helper T cells and related lymphocytes are critical in decisions about HIV status and antiretroviral therapies. HIV-infected people in resource poor countries have little or no access to appropriate cell counting, significantly affecting the use of antiretroviral therapies. The overall goal of this project is to develop a low cost, accurate system for HIV-related blood cell counting that can improve healthcare in developing regions.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diagnosis and medical management of HIV-infected individuals is significantly enhanced if one can simultaneously define the subset of the most common co-infections for which patients are at risk. Unfortunately, running such a series of parallel diagnostic tests is cost prohibitive, particularly in low-resource settings. Precision Photonics Corporation proposes to continue development of a low-cost, point-of-care, multiplexed fluorescence immunoassay system for the diagnosis of HIV and common co-infections from a single sample. The technology uses a proprietary laser illumination method combined with low- cost consumer electronics (e.g., DVD player lasers) and optics (consumer and cell phone cameras). The specific aims of the proposed project are to: (1) Transfer the reference design fluorescence reader and cartridge system completed during Phase II into an investigational device, positioned for an investigational device exemption (IDE) application to the FDA, including a fluorescent reader, cartridge, and system software. (2) Expand the multiplexed co-infection assay panel to include M. tuberculosis serology based on a panel of new diagnostic antigens and direct detection of hepatitis B surface antigen and Cryptococcus antigen. Aim 2 will also establish stabilization protocols, reagent packaging, and shelf life dataset, as well as quality assurance/quality control procedures. (3) Place instruments at collaborator sites and develop datasets based on three collections of clinical samples, including a cohort of archived samples collected through UCSD clinics; samples collected from international sites through collaboration with the NIAID AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG); and clinical samples collected and tested in Brazil. The outcome of this program will be a low cost, IDE-stage instrument with working diagnostic panel assays and a validated dataset to be bundled as part of an FDA submission. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The research and development performed in this project, if successful, will enable very low cost, easy to use tests at the point-of-care to help in the assessment of disease status of AIDS patients, particularly in resource limited settings. The simplicity and low cost of the technology will facilitate the use of antiretroviral therapy, greatly prolonging the lives of those infected with HIV and reducing the burden of disease in populations where HIV is endemic.",

Immediate treatment of stroke is critical for preservation brain tissue and ultimate recovery. For ischemic stroke, which comprises approximately four-fifths of all strokes, thrombolytic therapy by tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) has been proven to be effective in the critical first 3 hours from symptom onset. Unfortunately, studies have shown symptomatic hemorrhagic occurs in 6-11% of patients treated with intravenous tPA. Fear of this severe and often deadly side effect prevents the widespread use and full benefit of this therapy in the ischemic stroke population.  This SBIR Phase II application proposes the development of a point-of-care rapid diagnostic test for the proteomic marker cellular fibronectin (c-Fn), which has been shown in 3 independent studies to predict hemorrhagic transformation in tPA-treated patients with a sensitivity of 100%, as an aid to treatment decision. The goal under this proposal is to create a rapid test for c-Fn based on lateral flow technology with the ability to obtain a result within 10 minutes, achieve inter- and intra-assay variability of lt10%, and achieve a total production cost of under  25.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:         Project Narrative Physicians must decide on treatment of an ischemic stroke patient with a clot buster, tPA, within a critical 3 hour time window. The amount of cellular fibronectin (c-Fn) in the blood of patients at admission can identify if the patient is at high or low risk for a subsequent hemorrhage, fear of which prevents widespread useage of tPA. This proposal develops a rapid c-Fn test completed in 10 minutes to aid in the treatment decision of acute ischemic stroke patients that would lead to increase in patient safety, decrease in the long-term disability of stroke, and lower long-term healthcare spending.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Determining the reproductive toxicity risk of compounds is vitally important to ensure the health of the general population. It is a difficult and complex task involving testing in animals. While it is well known that mouse strain background can have a profound effect on phenotype, understanding the role of strain background in toxicity testing remains a tremendous challenge. An in vitro genetic testing system contributes toward this end by offering the advantages of lower cost, higher throughput and no sacrifice of animals in testing. An in vitro genetic system can be a  first tier  testing platform, directing in vivo testing to mouse strains that maximize informativeness and minimize animal use. We propose to develop an in vitro, ES cell based system to assess the impact of genetic background in toxicity testing. ES cells are particularly attractive for this purpose since they can be propagated indefinitely in their pluripotent state while retaining the ability to contribute to all tissues of an animal. In Phase I we demonstrated the feasibility of this system by establishing ES cell lines from six genetically distinct mouse strains and showing that a measurable and significant variability due to genetic background can be measured in response to exposure to a reference compound, retinoic acid. In Phase II, a panel of approximately 100 genetically distinct ES lines will be established and tested with a larger panel of reference compounds, toward the development of a system to define, map and identify the genetic components of cellular response to environmental burden. This system will lead to more predictive reproductive toxicity testing by providing a platform to investigate the role of genetic background on toxicity risk. The testing platform will be made commercially available to the pharmaceutical and chemical industries, as well as to academic institutions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to develop a system that can help elucidate the role of genetics in reproductive toxicity testing. The broad and varied genetic backgrounds in the proposed testing system better reflects the genetic diversity of the US population, and may lead to more predictive testing that reduces environmental health risk to the population.",

Trauma is mainly treated with intravenous liquids, such as isotonic crystalloid solutions. Although volume expansion is desirable, none of these solutions is capable of overcoming tissue oxygen deficits (ischemia). Proper use of transfused blood can assist in resuscitation; however there are significant problems with its use, including storage restraints, availability, typing, risk of disease transmission and immune suppression. These issues make the routine use of stored human blood for use outside the hospital impractical. In an attempt to overcome many of these issues, efforts have been made to develop hemoglobin based oxygen carrier (HBOCs) blood substitutes which have advantages such as decreased chance of disease transmission, lack of a need for typing, and most importantly improved availability with decreased storage demands. Prolong Pharmaceuticals has developed a unique HBOC product for the treatment of severe hemorrhagic shock consisting of a combination of PEGylated bovine hemoglobin (PEG-Hb) and hypertonic saline (HS). It is specifically designed to increase the oxygen carrying capacity of blood as well as to enhance the delivery of oxygen to tissues by keeping the vasculature open through its hypertonic-oncotic actions. We have found this product to be capable of rapidly restoring tissue oxygenation and repaying oxygen debt in an animal model of severe traumatic shock. In this Fast- Track SBIR grant, we will conduct the preclinical studies needed to support an IND to conduct clinical testing of the product. In the phase I component, we will conduct pharmacokinetic analysis of PEG-Hb/HS to define optimal dosing for follow up efficacy and toxicology assessment and to establish dosing parameters for future clinical studies. In the phase II SBIR component we will conduct additional efficacy studies to determine the extent of survival that PEG-Hb/HS induces in our animal model of trauma and will also perform toxicology assessment to support the future use of this product in the treatment of trauma.",

This markedly increased flux imposes extreme requirements on imaging detectors at many of the target stations, which cannot be met without fundamental detector improvements.  This project will develop a detector technology based on the detection of reaction products in the gas of a thin straw detector.  By using a dense-packed array of such straws, which can be more than 1 meter in length, efficient high resolution imaging can be achieved with a quantum leap in integral and differential counting rate.  In previous work, a complete 1 m2 neutron straw imaging system, utilizing natural boron-carbide straw coating, was developed.  In Phase I, this development was extended by investing in expensive 10B4C sputtering targets and constructing a 1 meter detector module that demonstrated a five-fold increase in stopping power.  In Phase II, a 22 module 1 m2 single layer detector will be fabricated.  Because the outsourced sputtering targets represent more than 80% of the total cost, an in-house reel-to-reel coating system for production of large quantities of the requisite coated foil also will be developed. Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The economical reel-to-reel production technique should enable the production of m2 imaging detectors at a very small fraction of the cost of currently envisaged detectors based on 3He. Because the availability of 3He on earth is extremely limited, its utilization in the thousands of detectors currently contemplated is very unrealistic.  In contrast, the 10B isotope is extremely plentiful and cheap, and therefore the innovative manufacturing capability should meet a very significant need in neutron detection",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on the commercialization of a new class of ultra-compact, low-cost, robust, and alignment insensitive spectrometer for diffuse source spectroscopy with lower cost and considerably better overall performance compared to conventional slit-based spectrometers.  Intellectual merits: The spectrometers available in the current market are based on core technologies invented around one hundred years ago. The main problems of the traditional spectrometers are being bulky, sensitive to input alignment, relatively expensive, and low optical throughput, because narrow slits, lenses, high quality thin gratings, and the detector array are required in the system. As the portability, cost, and sensitivity are top concerns in recent biological and environmental sensing applications, a new class of spectrometers that satisfy those needs is in high demand. The proposed research is to commercialize an ultra-compact, low-cost, robust, and alignment insensitive spectrometer, which is composed of only a volume hologram and a detector array. The operation frequency range and the spectral bandwidth of the proposed spectrometers cover the requirements of most practical applications. The spectrometers can also be used to form special-purpose functional spectrometers with any desired spectral transfer function.  If successful the proposed spectrometer will have a broad range of applications in the fields of biochemistry, medicine, pharmaceuticals,\nindustrial quality assurance, homeland security, mineralogy, and environmental purposes. Specifically, in the applications where the light source has a diffuse nature (e.g., fluorescence spectroscopy) the developed spectrometer will show the best sensitivity among all the existing technologies. The ultra-compact lightweight nature of the proposed spectrometers makes them a perfect choice for handheld sensing devices that are of high current demand in several fields mentioned above. The entire US market volume that can be covered by this technology has been $2.6B in 2005, with a prospected 7% growth rate through 2010. The use of volume holograms (which are typically recorded in low-cost materials like photopolymers) to replace multiple bulky optics (e.g., slit, collimating lens, and Fourier transforming lens in the case of spectrometer) is an important enabling technology that can impact several applications (e.g., imaging and sensing) beyond the proposed functionalities.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project seeks to fully establish ProtElix' scaffold-based human fibronectin libraries (14th fibronectin type III module of Human Fibronectin) as platform technology to discover novel antibody-mimics drug candidates for a wide range of therapeutic applications. The social and commercial implications of this discovery may include developing second generation protein drug antagonists which are less expensive, more efficacious and safer than current monoclonal antibody-based drugs. Overall, this Phase II Project will be divided in two stages: a research plan during which different binding and stability optimization strategies will be executed. Moreover, ProtElix technology will be tested with several protein targets (CD20, EGFR, VEGFR2, VLA-4) in order to fully assess the universality of the platform itself. The second stage of the project will be focused upon drug development activities. Lead candidates will undergo full kinetic characterization in vitro and in vivo and will be tested for PK/PD in small animal models. By the completion of phase II, a comprehensive discovery platform for proprietary human 14FN3-based antibody mimics libraries will be fully developed and the \"\"drugability\"\" of lead candidates assessed.  The application of protein scaffold to develop new therapeutics is becoming an area of great commercial potential with high social implications as it relates to lower the cost and increase the accessibility of therapy to\nseveral life-threatening diseases. In particular the use of antibody-mimics to selectively block therapeutically important protein targets could be the key to overcome the clinical limitations and potential toxicity and lack of efficacy of current antibody-based therapeutics. The flexible format of ProtElix scaffold platform technology together with its proprietary mutagenesis technology for producing \"\"intelligent\"\" library diversity will provide an attractive alternative to pharmaceutical and biotech companies for the discovery and development of next-generation biotherapeutics. In addition, the intrinsic characteristics of the Fibronectin Type III domain (i.e. small size, no disulfide bonds) would lead to cheaper cost of manufacturing and potentially more effective and safe drugs (higher tissue penetration and faster clearance) compared to immunoglobulin-based antibodies. If successful, this project will take the potential applications of scaffold-based therapeutics to a higher level than first generation antibodies, including cancer, autoimmune diseases, cardiovascular and infectious diseases.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ongoing concerns about the management and treatment of children's pain/mood make quantitative assessment in children a high medical priority. Currently, the dominant clinical technique has children indicate only their pain by selecting from among a set of static, stylized facial expressions. Although the widespread use of such methods has yielded substantial clinical information, these  face scales  can only show a small number of expressions, do not allow the user to indicate mood as well as pain, and do not provide for automatic computer storage and data analysis. The objective of this Phase II proposal is to further develop a computerized method for assessing pain and mood by having a child adjust an animated cartoon face whose expression can range continuously from a neutral state to a frown for pain, and from a smile to a frown for mood. The child uses a PDA computer to create two facial expressions; one to indicate their current pain, the other to indicate their current mood. This software is referred to as the Computer Face Scale and its psychometric properties have been established in Phase I work with hospitalized children at a rural and an urban hospital. The first objective of the work is to develop a wireless network so that assessments obtained with PDAs in different hospital rooms can be seen together on a server at the nurse's station. The second objective is to test the responsiveness of the new method by collecting pain and mood ratings from children (5 to 12 years) periodically both pre- and post-operatively. The third objective is to establish the construct validity of the new computer method by comparing results with a well-established poster version of a Face Scale intended to measure only pain, and a verbal rating scale to measure mood. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS. There are excellent commercial prospects for computer software that allows children to rate their levels of pain and mood. Such a method could also prove useful for testing adults with limited language skills, and in cross-cultural situations where the impact of language differences must be negated. Once the software package is implemented and tested, site licenses for the program will be sold to clinics, hospitals, and private practices, as well as to pharmaceutical companies conducting clinical trials both in the US and internationally. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The objective of this project is to determine the responsiveness of a new computer method for assessing children's pain and mood. Children adjust the expression of a cartoon face to represent the degree of their pain and their current mood state (happy to sad). Ratings will be obtained both pre- and post-operatively from children and the change in their ratings post-operatively will be tracked.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Phase II proposal seeks support for completing implementation of effective fragment potential (EFP) method [J. Phys. Chem. A, v.105 p.293 (2001)] in the Q-Chem electronic structure program. The EFP approach enables one to treat large systems with localized interactions by separating them into a small  important  part (e.g., reaction center) treated quantum mechanically (QM), and the environment, which is further subdivided into the so-called effective fragments (EFs). Conceptually, the EFP method is similar to the popular QM/MM (molecular mechanics) scheme; however, it replaces empirical MM force fields by rigorous interactions derived from QM calculations of individual fragments. Once the necessary parameters of EFs are pre-computed and stored in an auxiliary database, the cost of an EF calculation is very similar to that of a QM/MM one. During Phase I, we completed most of the steps necessary for pre-computing EF parameters and energy calculation. During Phase II, we propose to complete energy calculation, as well as implement analytic gradient calculation, which is crucial tool for computational research. The full implementation of the EFP method in Q-Chem will enable the researchers to apply advanced QM methods (e.g., equation-of-motion and coupled-cluster methods) to study opens-shell and electronically excited centers in biological molecules, solutions, and materials. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Quantum modeling is the most accurate and versatile among different molecular simulation methods of biological systems. In this SBIR Phase II application, we propose to implement and develop a method that will enable accurate quantum mechanical modeling for large systems.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): QCMetrix, Inc. proposes to expand upon the strengths of the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) to develop, implement, and evaluate a software system, Decision Support for Safer Surgery (DS3). DS3 will inform the care provider of patient-specific risks for surgery and of evidence-based processes of care that will minimize these risks in real- time, and will facilitate the collection of Surgical Care Improvement Project (SCIP) measures. The CMS Surgical Care Improvement Program's (SCIP) performance measures are complex and will need aggressive implementation strategies. The National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) collects surgical data from participating hospitals and reports risk-adjusted surgical outcomes back to the hospital. The rationale for this proposal is to initiate the first steps of taking the NSQIP from retrospective data collection and reporting to real-time data collection and clinical decision support. The goals of DS3 are to assist care providers in improving performance on the SCIP measures and reducing surgical complications. Project Objectives. 1) Develop risk models to assist in patient risk evaluations and review and affirm SCIP processes of care. 2) Implement and integrate a clinical decision support system into the workflow of the care providers. 3) Test DS3 in two hospitals. 4) Measure and address barriers to implementation of decision support in the preoperative setting. 5) Measure the effect of DS3 implementation on concordance with SCIP process measures for the two hospitals. Project Methods. This is a 3-year Fast-Track proposal. In phase 1, a 6-month planning study, we will update the risk models previously constructed for perioperative surgical site infections, myocardial infarction and cardiac arrest, deep vein thrombosis, postoperative pneumonia, and mortality. We will conduct site visits to gather requirements for the DS3 system and we will prepare a planning document for Phase 2. In Phase 2, a 30-month implementation project, we will implement a DS3 prototype, link the system to existing health information systems, and live test the prototype at two hospitals. We will train care providers in the use of the system and will collect usage statistics. We will conduct surveys to document user experience and user opinion and will examine concordance with the SCIP measures before and after the introduction of the system. Benefits. Reducing surgical complications is a national focus. We expect the proposed decision support system to be instrumental in the workflow of surgical care. Patients will benefit from this system because it is focused on the reduction of surgical complications. Care providers will benefit from the system because the evidence-based care process will be made more consistent and efficient. Hospitals will benefit economically because the system is intended to reduce the cost of surgical complications and will meet pay-for-performance criteria.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Radiation exposure of nuclear workers is not only a serious health and safety issue, but also imposes substantial costs on nuclear utilities. Precise knowledge of the radiation environment within a nuclear facility is essential to minimizing personnel exposure. In recent years, there has been an emphasis on remote monitoring technology (RMT) in the nuclear industry. RMT often includes networks of fixed dosimeters. In many situations however, one would like to be able to monitor the radiation level using mobile robot-mounted-dosimeters or personal dosimeters. For this dosimeter information to be most useful, it must be correlated with location information. Q-Track is the pioneer in Near-Field Electromagnetic Ranging or  NFER(R)  technology. NFER(R) systems operate in the MF band under Part 15 limits as low-power unlicensed transmitters. By using relatively low frequency, long wavelength transmissions, NFER(R) signals can propagate in complicated industrial environments with minimal impact from multipath. The Phase I effort demonstrated that Q-Track's NFER(R) systems can yield accurate real-time location even in the very difficult RF propagation environment of a nuclear industrial facility. We also demonstrated a proof- of-concept radiation map with the assistance of our subcontractor Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The ultimate goal of the Phase II effort is to prototype and test an economically viable commercial system for real-time location aware radiation monitoring. Conventional dosimeters provide radiation awareness to individual workers. The proposed effort will enable a Location Aware Radiation Monitoring System that takes this individual data and integrates it with location data to provide real-time radiation awareness in nuclear facilities. The proposed system will also support robotic monitoring of radiation in suspect areas, minimizing exposure to health physicists or radiological control technicians. Finally, the system will provide worker location and status data that will be of enormous value in the event of an emergency situation. The anticipated outcome of the proposed Phase II effort will be a prototype Location Aware Radiation Monitoring System with the following characteristics: Typical Location Accuracy: 1m or better in typical nuclear industrial environments Update Rate: 1Hz update rate for both location and radiation dose rate Hardware Integration: Worker or robot tag with combined location and dosimetry Software Integration: Radiological control software with real-time radiation mapping PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed effort aims to develop a prototype Location Aware Radiation Monitoring System to correlate radiation exposure with real-time location. The proposed system will enhance the radiological safety of nuclear workers, allowing nuclear utilities to not only minimize worker radiation exposure, but also reduce the cost of electrical power. By sponsoring the proposed effort, NIEHS will not only promote nuclear worker safety but also promote worker safety in a wide variety of secondary industries where precise location of hazardous environmental characteristics would be beneficial.",

Specifically, we propose to simplify disease impact screening (for prevention and early warning), and monitoring of HRQOL outcomes by adapting a consumer-focused Smart Measurement  system, developed using item response theory (IRT) to improve outcomes measures, utilizing computerized adaptive testing (CAT) software to improve data capture and score estimation, and deliver content via the Internet. Phase I demonstrated administrative feasibility and supported the assumptions underlying the standardization of the content of disease-specific impact items and their calibration across diseases to achieve measures that are more responsive to outcomes as well as meaningfully comparable across diseases. Other complimentary SBIR projects focusing on single diseases have demonstrated the potential for more practical and precise assessments over a wide range of severity levels - and the possibility of eliminating  ceiling  and  floor  effects. In Phase II we will combine these efforts and expand our tests of standardized disease-specific and generic measurement models among larger samples of aging adults with multiple co-morbid conditions by administering items from new standardized disease specific item banks as well as previously-validated disease-specific and generic HRQOL measures to address the following aims: (1) Improve the instrument and item pools using (a) qualitative methods and expert/consumer evaluation, (b) quantitative studies among large samples of the most prevalent and burdensome chronic conditions (e.g., asthma, CHF, CKD, depression, diabetes, headache, obesity, osteoarthritis), and (c) head-to-head comparisons between more efficient static and dynamic short forms versus  legacy  (previously-validated) tools; (2) Develop and evaluate aggregated disease-specific and generic feedback report(s), suitable for consumers (who are and are not currently  patients ) and their clinicians, with user-friendly normative/benchmark interpretive information; (3) Evaluate the self-assessment system in a longitudinal prospective panel study to replicate tests of psychometric properties, test predictive validity (medical expenditures, role/social participation, mortality) and responsiveness, and address data quality, context and mode effects, accessibility of the Internet, and effects of respondent characteristics; (4) Gather norms by administering generic and disease specific measures to representative US population samples with and without chronic conditions. The Phase II product will be a fully operational self-assessment system for screening and monitoring disease impact for the aging population with multiple co-morbid conditions, including: improved  static  and dynamic (CAT) short forms for assessing disease impact and generic health outcomes, user-friendly feedback reports and documentation.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ultimate goal of this project is to develop a new safe AND effective tool for physicians to treat patients with cancer. The EVade Ribonucleases are recombinant variants of mammalian enzymes that are effective in mouse xenograft models of multiple cancer types without exhibiting significant toxicity. While they are effective, Quintessence is interested in increasing the potency of the EVade Ribonucleases to improve clinical outcome. Many of the FDA approved cancer therapies work by very similar mechanisms, including genotoxicity, anti- metabolite and microtubule binding. Newer, targeted therapies are being developed, with a few of these drugs already on the market. We believe an agent with a novel mechanism of action and mild side effect profile, such as an EVade Ribonuclease, is a strong candidate for cancer therapy. In Phase I, the pharmacokinetic profile of the EVade Ribonucleases was changed by conjugation with polyethylene glycol (PEG). These changes resulted in a significant increase (gt20%) in efficacy in vivo at five-fold lower doses than the unmodified Evade Ribonucleases. While benefits of PEG7EVade RNase conjugates has been demonstrated, additional research is necessary to ensure the lead candidate, a conjugate called QBI-206, can be successfully commercialized. The primary goal of the Phase II SBIR grant is to provide data to support the tangible benefits of the conjugate relative to the unconjugated Evade RNase QBI-139. The specific activities for the Phase II grant include: determination of the optimal schedule, a dose response and comparison of antibody formation to an unmodified EVade Ribonuclease. In addition, the side effects of QBI-206 will be compared to an unmodified EVade Ribonuclease (QBI-139) will be determined in a model that provides a direct link to doses to be used in human clinical trials. These activities are all directed to taking QBI-206 into a Phase I human clinical trial. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There is a clear and unfilled need for highly efficacious cancer therapeutics, and our goal is to provide an effective new tool for physicians to treat their patients who have cancer. Cancer is the second most common cause of death in the developed world. On a worldwide basis, cancer is responsible for 12.5% of deaths. New cases of cancer are expected to rise to 16M/year in 2020, up from 11M /yr in 2002. Cancer-related deaths are anticipated to rise from 6.7M to 10M over the same period.",

In addition to the fuel cell application, the new blower should find use in other commercial applications (e.g., heat treating furnaces), where other blowers could not be used because of oil-contamination and temperature limitations",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will use readily available plant protein and innovative, environmentally friendly processes to develop bio-based plastic prototypes such as packaging products. The resulting formulation and production processes for each prototype will meet the needs of large manufacturing companies and consumers who seek biobased and biodegradable products. The prototypes will be designed to meet production requirements, product characteristics and costs that compete with incumbent petroleum-based plastics. Phase II goals are to refine the formulations and processes from Phase I to produce acceptable prototypes for our potential customers, particularly in the packaging industry. The results of a defined formulation and process for each product will enable R&D Green Materials to develop, in Phase III, a scalable pilot process to produce the bio-based products and show that economic implementation can be achieved by our industrial partners.  The project will result in unique processes and technologies to produce biobased, biodegradable plastic products that are functionally equivalent to nonbiodegradable petroleum-based plastics. R&D Green Materials will develop environmentally friendly, cost-effective alternatives to plastic products through technologies\nthat utilize plant-based materials that remain non-toxic from manufacture to disposal. The results will allow industrial partners the freedom to utilize bio-based plastic products without the current problems of high cost and inappropriate characteristics of the process and/or product. As use of the biobased plastics becomes widespread, the general environmental benefits and reduction of plastic pollution is likely to exert a positive effect on human health through reduced exposure to carcinogens and endocrine disruptors. Compared with synthetic polymers, the unique biobased polymers used in the Phase II prototypes can reduce environmental impact, minimize pollution, and conserve resources.",

New applications in high-energy physics demand smaller radiation and charged particle sources.  This project will develop a new kind of particle source, the Micro Accelerator Platform (MAP), which will be powered by a laser, delivered over a fiber optic, and be about a cubic millimeter in size.  The MAP will be based on a microstructure fabricated from dielectric materials, much the way microelectronic chips and MEMS devices are produced.  In Phase I, a proof-of-principle MAP structure was optimized, and the feasibility of relativistic particle acceleration in the all-dielectric MAP structure was demonstrated.  Fixturing and instrumentation for a proof-of-principle experiment in Phase II was designed.  Phase II will finalize the design of the structure, fabrication processes will be developed, and prototype structures will be fabricated and tested. An acceleration greater than or equal to 1GeV/m over a =100 \u00c2\u00b5m long, relativistic structure will be demonstrated.Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  In addition to the application for high energy physics research, the MAP holds great promise as a new form of cancer radiation therapy, delivered through a minimally invasive procedure to the tumor site, thus avoiding damage to healthy tissue.  This new tool potentially could provide a safer, more effective, and less expensive alternative to the radiation treatment available today.

        "abstract": "Locally grown foods account for less than one percent of the total $900 billion in retail food sales in the U.S. (18) Therefore, consumers purchase more than ninety percent of their food from supermarkets. In order for local small family farms to grab a greater portion of food sales, they must get their locally grown foods on the mainstream supermarket shelves, as well as partner with stores to get foods to consumers in nontraditional ways, such as cCSAs. The food system plays a central role in the health of Kansas Citians. It dictates access, quality, affordability, and the nutritional value of the food we consume. The state of our health is inextricably related to the quality of our food system. Unfortunately, healthy, nutritious, accessible and affordable food eludes many people, which, in turn, undermines health. Gaps include hunger and food insecurity, lack of fair prices for farmers, lack of fresh local food in schools and institutional setting, lack of full service grocery stores in inner city food deserts, lack of knowledge on what food is nutritious, and lack of knowledge on how to prepare nutritious meals. Various organizations attempt to fill these gaps, and many alleviate suffering in the short run, but they lack the coordinated, broad-based structure and sufficient expertise and funds to provide comprehensive, ongoing solutions. GNFF has already successfully established an effective model to distribute locally grown foods from small family farms into mainstream supermarkets. Now they'd like to take that one step further, by providing the same service to Kansas City's inner city food deserts through a permutation of the CSA concept referred to as the `New Collaborative CSA' (cCSA). The cCSA will be developed as collaboration between Good Natured Family Farm Alliance, Balls Food Stores, Hallmark Cards, inner city community churches and Bistro Kids Farm 2 School Program. Each partner will provide an essential part to the cCSA, to aid those vulnerable populations in the inner city food deserts with access to local farm fresh food. In summary, the partnership between GNFF, Balls Food Stores, Hallmark Cards, an inner city community church, and Bistro Kids Farm 2 School program will: a) increase sales and revenue for GNFF farmers by giving them access to a new market of consumers, b) increase sales and revenue for Balls Food Stores by giving them access to a new market of consumers, and c) provide healthy, farm fresh, locally grown food to vulnerable populations in Kansas City's food deserts.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In Phase II we will continue the development of RainDance Technologies droplet-based microfluidic instrument platform, based on the results from the Phase I proof-of-principle experiments, and develop a commercial system that includes the ability to screen compound libraries in droplets. Our goal by the end of Phase II will be to provide a complete instrument platform able to screen a compound library composed of up to 100,000 members using assays for both a recombinant enzyme and an established cell line. Initial efforts will focus on compound management and handling of barcoded droplets, additional effort will fully enable microfluidic assays and disposable chip designs, and we will complete the integration and engineering development for commercialization before the end of the two year grant period. We believe that significant value to the research and pharmaceutical communities will result from complete development of a droplet-based open platform, specifically for the use of high throughput screening (HTS) formatted droplet libraries with fluorescent in vitro protein and cellular assays. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Miniaturization of laboratory operations in biology and chemistry has reduced reaction volumes from a few milliliters (in test-tubes) to a few microliters (in microtiter plates) - a 1000-fold reduction. The drive to increase throughput by assay miniaturization has been particularly important for drug screening. Today, many industrial screening programs process 100,000 compounds a day (~1 per second), a thousand times as many as were processed in an entire week in 1990. Although robotic microtiter plate based infrastructure has enabled the screening of collections exceeding one million small molecules, the primary screening methodology has largely been restricted to assaying a single high concentration of each compound. Further reducing test volumes below the 1-2 ltl capacity of 1536-well plates would create both significant cost savings and enable higher throughput. Furthermore, a primary screen that included a dose-response curve for every compound, for example, would significantly reduce the number of false positives and false negatives compared to a single-point screen, and are able to identify subtle pharmacologies such as partial agonism or antagonism. In addition, it should also be possible to screen each compound simultaneously against multiple targets to determine specificity. However, using microtiter plate technology for further miniaturization is problematic: for example, evaporation becomes significant in microliter volumes, capillary action causes  wicking  and bridging of liquid between wells, and this would not alleviate the time and consumables cost associated with robotic microtiter plate handling. The key technology in this proposal is RainDance Technologies' droplet-based microfluidic platform. Using this platform, we believe we can further reduce the volume of each assay by 103- to 106-fold and increase the throughput gt1,000 times, by confining each assay in a separate microscopic droplet. We will use this technology to enable high throughput screening for molecular and cell-based assays, significantly reducing the cost, time, and reagents for screening, and enabling the prospect of high throughput primary cell screening.",

        "abstract": "Biodiesel is a fuel that is made by processing vegetable oil or animal fats into a liquid fuel that can be combusted in a standard, unmodified diesel engine.  The use of biodiesel reduces CO2 emissions by over 80% compared to petroleum and it reduces our dependence on foreign oil while promoting economic opportunities in rural America.  When biodiesel is made from low-cost waste oils or fats the environment benefits are even greater.  However, the growth of the domestic biodiesel industry is limited because the current production processes requires a highly refined (expensive) low free fatty acid vegetable oil, and the cost of biodiesel is almost entirely determined by the cost of the feedstock.  Furthermore there is a limited supply of vegetable oil over and above what is needed for food and animal feed.  TDA Research has identified a new process that should solve these technical problems, utilizing unused waste feedstocks and reducing the price of biodiesel.  The process, which uses process-intensification to combine multiple chemical reactions in a single vessel, runs well on very low cost, high free fatty acid waste and recycled oils and fats.  The Phase II project will operate and fully characterize a laboratory scale version of the process, and determine optimum operating conditions and the economics of producing large quantities of biodiesel.  The environmental benefits that specifically address EPA programmatic concerns, Including (1) reducing CO2 emissions from on-road and farm diesel engines; and, (2) providing a technology that converts waste into fuel, reducing land fill mass.  The results of the Phase I project include process performance results, and a detailed engineering and economic analysis.  In Phase I we determined that a 20 million gallon per year production plant could produce biodiesel at a product cost of $2.63 per gallon (from waste oil).  It is anticipated that in Phase II we will further develop the pilot process, evaluate possible waste feedstocks, confirm the catalyst does not lose activity and prepare a more detailed engineering and economic analysis that will be used to market the process.",

        "abstract": "Although the Fischer-Tropsch (FT) process for the production of liquid fuels from coal, natural gas, and biomass is run on a commercial scale in both South Africa and Malaysia, several challenges remain, in particular, the need to supply a clean, essentially-contaminant-free synthesis gas feed stream.  This project will develop a low-cost, high-capacity sorbent that can remove trace contaminants \u00c2\u00bf including sulfur, halides, arsenic, and mercury \u00c2\u00bf from coal-derived synthesis gas.  The sorbent will reduce the concentration of all these contaminants to ppbv levels, providing optimum protection for the FT synthesis catalysts used to convert coal derived synthesis gas into liquid fuels.  Unlike the commercially available trace metal adsorbents or sulfur polishing sorbents, the proposed sorbent will operate at the exit temperature of the warm gas clean-up step (500oF).  Phase I developed a highly active sorbent that can reduce the concentration of sulfur, halides, nitrogen compounds and trace metals (such as arsenic and mercury) to ultra low levels.  In a preliminary cost analysis, the economic viability of the process was demonstrated.  Phase II will continue to improve the performance of the sorbent, and its production will be scaled-up using commercial manufacturing techniques.  The concept will be demonstrated at a larger scale using actual coal-derived synthesis gas, and a detailed system analysis and engineering assessment will be conducted. Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  A viable alternative to crude oil is needed to moderate the effect of oil price hikes and provide an interim bridge until some other fuel source can commercially supplant petroleum-based fuels. Coal is the most promising resource with over 250 billion tons of known domestic reserves.  FT synthesis is the most economically viable method of converting coal into transportation fuels.

        "abstract": "Acrylonitrile is an important chemical intermediate used to produce acrylic fibers, synthetic rubber, and other polymers.  Current catalysts for the production of acrylonitrile operate at high temperatures, making the processes energy intensive, and generate large quantities of unwanted byproducts, including carbon dioxide and hydrogen cyanide (HCN).  This project will investigate several new catalyst formulations for propylene ammoxidation to produce acrylonitrile.  These catalysts would be expected be active at significantly lower temperatures than for existing industrial catalysts.  Phase I prepared and characterized a variety of new catalyst compositions for achieving better selectivity and activity for the ammoxidation of propylene.  Tests conducted in an automated flow reactor demonstrated that the new catalyst formulations gave high selectivity to acrylonitrile at temperatures lower than for catalysts in current use.  Limited lifetime testing showed that these catalysts would remain active for long periods.  Phase II will further optimize and test several of these new catalysts to determine the combination of catalyst formulation and operating conditions that provide the best selectivity to acrylonitrile at the lowest possible temperature.  Based on the results of these tests, extended lifetime testing (> 1000 hours) will be conducted with the best ammoxidation catalyst, and the results will be used to predict catalyst lifetime and replacement costs.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The new propylene ammoxidation catalyst would be designed for use as a drop-in replacement for current commercial catalysts.  As such, no new process or reaction equipment would need to be developed.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Each year an estimated 80,000 fire fighters battle wildfires, spending long durations at the fire front where they are exposed to high levels of smoke and heat. Sudden changes in weather or fire conditions increase the \nchances of being entrapped by a wildfire or caught in the burnover of an advancing fire front. Wildfire smoke contains toxic components, including particulates, high levels of volatile organic compounds, acid gases, and carbon monoxide. However, the single\n largest cause of death or injury is heat-damage to the airways or lungs, caused by breathing superheated air; this risk is actually greater than that from external burns. Fire experts stress that the MOST important aspect of protection when working near a\n wildfire is to protect the respiratory tract. Currently, there is no suitable device available to protect fire fighters from exposure to these dangers. TDA Research, Inc. proposes to develop a portable device that will protect firefighters from superheate\nd air and carbon monoxide (CO) when trapped inside a fire shelter.

Many sour crudes originate in the Western Hemisphere, including heavy crudes from Venezuela, southern California, and the enormous quantities of oil sands in Canada.  Processing and upgrading these heavy feedstocks requires considerable quantities of hydrogen.  Unfortunately, revamping or installing new hydrogen capacity with conventional technologies such as methane steam reforming or petroleum coke gasification is expensive.

        "abstract": "In times when critical national infrastructure depends more than ever on digital networks, the prevention of cyber attacks, as opposed to reacting after security has been compromised, becomes a chief concern.  Intrusion Detection and Prevention (IDP) systems serve an indispensable role in proactively preserving the integrity of computer networks under cyber attacks.  However, two independent trends are driving IDP solutions to a breaking point:  (1) typical pattern-matching IDP solutions deploy low-coverage signatures that can be easily bypassed by new classes of exploits; and (2) as network data rates increase, IDP boxes are overwhelmed by the quantity of computation they must perform to secure the system.  This project will explore the use of a new signature generation framework that produces protocol-aware polymorphic-proof signatures with larger coverage.  In addition, a novel protocol compiler perspective will be developed to enable the rapid mapping of signature and protocol specifications onto hardware.  Phase I identified the core reason leading to the IDP breaking point:  lack of protocol-awareness limits the coverage of signatures and makes polymorphic attacks a powerful weapon for bypassing existing security measures.  Phase II will use a theoretical and practical framework to implement a commercial-ready high-performance IDP solution based on our compiler approach.Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  High-speed, protocol-aware intrusion detection systems should be useful to organizations (companies, governments, utilities, armed forces, and even individuals) whose valuable assets make them targets of sophisticated cyber attackers.  Security and cost savings benefits would accrue when assets are better and more efficiently protected, and commercial enterprises can secure their business operations more effectively and cheaply",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of an [evidence-based], cost-effective and [easily disseminated] form of intensive intervention for children with autistic spectrum disorders (ASD) is a major priority for both the health and education systems in this country. The most recent prevalence estimate for ASD from the CDC is 1 in 150 children. According to the National Research Council, these children need intensive intervention (25 hours/week, 1:1 or 1:2 teacher to pupil ratio), which most states do not provide because a) there is a national shortage of trained personnel, b) such interventions when provided by professionals are very expensive ( 25-60K) and c) an evidence-based, readily disseminated, cost-effective model has not yet been developed and tested for national distribution. The unmet national need is enormous. The P.L.A.Y. Project (Play and Language for Autistic Youngsters) Home Consultation model (PLAY) is an innovative train-the-trainer solution to potentially address this national need. Using Greenspan's DIR/developmental framework, and a highly-structured educational approach including video feedback, home consultants train parents how to be their child's best PLAY partner for one-tenth the cost ( 4K) of having professionals providing intensive services. Preliminary clinical evidence from a pilot study indicates that the model is promising. Parents learned the methods PLAY and children in the intervention group showed clinical as well as statistical improvements. Furthermore, in the Phase I SBIR controlled study just completed, 2 intervention and 2 control sites each enrolled 20 children with ASD. In close partnership with Easter Seals and Michigan State University, the grant successfully piloted the procedures needed for execution of the Phase II trial. The controlled study established the feasibility of doing a larger Phase II trial and control study results, despite small numbers and brief intervention, were encouraging. Early dissemination of the model into the real world settings of community agencies, schools, and hospitals has also been successfully accomplished. The hypothesis for the Phase II trial is that PLAY's parent-training intervention model can significantly improve developmental outcomes for young children with autism. A successful trial would encourage private insurers and government agencies to approve major increases in funding for autism intensive intervention services, resulting in wide dissemination of this model, substantial growth in PLAY's business, and significant social benefit. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The P.L.A.Y. Project trains parents to provide intensive intervention for their young children with autism. We are proposing to carry out a randomized controlled clinical trial to demonstrate effectiveness of this intervention model in community settings. A successful study could impact the national strategies for caring for children with autism.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Unnatural amino acids represent one of the largest and growing classes of intermediates used by the pharmaceutical, agrochemical and fine chemical industries. Demand for these compounds at large scale and high optical purity is now very significant, due to their application and success in single enantiomer pharmaceuticals, particularly for the areas of virology and oncology. No synthetic or biosynthetic method however, has proven sufficiently versatile to prepare these compounds broadly at scale. Richmond Chemical Corporation (RC Corp.) has recently developed an efficient and general chemo-enzymatic process to prepare enantiomerically pure L- and D-amino acids in high yield by deracemization of racemic starting materials. This method involves the concerted action of an enantioselective amino acid oxidase biocatalyst and a non-selective chemical reducing catalyst to affect the stereo-inversion of one enantiomer, and can result in an enantiomeric excess (ee) of gt 99 % from the starting racemate, with product yields of over 90 %. This approach, conducted entirely in water, (thereby minimizing waste streams) compares very favorably to resolution processes, which have a maximum single pass yield of 50 %. We have successfully developed methods to optimize the efficiency of the process and establish competitive economics at scale. However, the breadth of application of this process is limited by the substrate range of the native oxidase biocatalysts. In the Phase I work of this project, we successfully applied powerful methods of in vitro enzyme evolution to demonstrate the adaptability of the oxidase biocatalysts, by successfully isolating variants of D-amino acid oxidase with high activity and enantioselectivity towards sterically bulky amino acids of high commercial importance. These amino acids are of high relevance due to their favorable pharmacokinetic properties but are difficult to prepare by traditional methods. In addition, the stability of the natural D-amino acid oxidase was greatly enhanced using the same approach. In parallel we successfully identified conditions in which the reduction step can be carried out with near quantitative yield under mild conditions. These results validate key aspects required for deracemization as a platform bioprocess and we now propose in Phase II to develop the scalable chemo-enzymatic deracemization processes to prepare these and additional unnatural amino acids for industry. We will continue the directed evolution of the oxidase biocatalyst and optimize critical reaction parameters including substrate load, biocatalyst production, formulation and re-use, as well as product isolation and recovery. The optimized deracemization processes will be implemented in the commercial manufacture of unnatural amino acids at large-scale. This work plan will result in new general bioprocess technology for the fine chemical industry, to produce chiral synthetic intermediates for pharmaceutical applications at commercial scale. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project is aimed towards the development of an economical enzymatic process for the synthesis of optically pure unnatural amino acids. These amino acids are in great demand for the synthesis of a wide range of important pharmaceutical compounds such HIV protease inhibitors, anti-cancer agents and anti-diabetic drugs.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The objective of this project is the continued development of a solid freeform fabrication system for producing dental restorations and devices which began in Phase I. This system is based on the  robocasting  approach. Robocasting is a solid freeform fabrication technique that uses automated extrusion of colloidal slurries, pastes, inks, etc. to build complicated structures of ceramics and metals. A great deal of investment in dental CAD/CAM has occurred in recent years due to benefits of time savings from reduction of traditional manual fabrication. In our proposed technique, as opposed to current CAD/CAM systems, material waste is minimized due to direct fabrication via printing of the desired materials. The resulting instrument will have several impressive capabilities and advantages: 1) Precise control of wall thickness and the ability to increase the thickness in portions of the restoration requiring more strength. 2) The capability for multiple materials to strategically place stronger compositions where necessary as well as graded colors leading to better aesthetic qualities. 3) The ability to fabricate a restoration from a dental scan or a dental impression. 4) Versatility, potential fabrication of removable partial denture frameworks, implant abutments and custom implants. 5) Production of blocks for existing dental CAD/CAM systems with graded color to enhance esthetics which are primarily now limited to monochromatic materials. The proposed system fulfills the aims announced in PA-04- 161, Manufacturing Processes of Medical, Dental, and Biological Technologies to develop rapid prototyping and manufacture technology. In Phase I the Aims of developing inks for printing alumina and porcelain dental materials were accomplished as well as the production of prototype multi-color blocks. The overall objective of Phase II is to have products in the form of multi color blocks, inks, and a benchtop system commercially available. Objectives for Phase II: 1. Produce a robocaster capable of fabricating multi-color blocks on a commercial scale. 2. Produce a benchtop robocaster for laboratories to fabricate crown and bridge frameworks. 3. Create user-friendly software for production of multi-color blocks and software to integrate the data obtained from a scan of dental casts for use with the benchtop robocaster. 4. Finalize the design of the multi - color block and create a shade table to allow the proper selection and positioning of a designed restoration within the block to produce the desired shade. 5. Fabricate three unit bridge frameworks using the previously developed alumina inks from Phase I and develop new inks to fabricate crown and bridge frameworks from yttria partially stabilized tetragonal zirconia. At the end of Phase II, the robcaster products will decrease fabrication time, material waste, patient treatment time and improve the reliability of the restorations. In the future, additional inks will be developed for metals and plastics to further expanding the capability of the system to cover all aspects of dental therapy.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Devices produced in this project will provide dentists and laboratories with new products for treatment of decayed and missing teeth. These products may decrease the amount of time a patient will spend at the dentist and produce a restoration that better matches the patient's teeth. There also is the potential for decreased cost by reducing material waste and additional laboratory fees.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Close to 342,000 Americans die of lung disease each year, particularly from lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This makes lung disease America's number three killer, responsible for one in every seven deaths. In general, for lung cancer or COPD, resection presents the best chance of survival and an agreeable quality of life. The most frequent complication following lung resection is air leakage, which typically occurs along the staple line and has an incidence from 34% to 50%. There is no reliable method in the marketplace to prevent this leakage, and the corrective treatment can be complicated and expensive. The economic cost of COPD alone will amount to about  800 billion over the next 20 years. A material that seals and bolsters the delicate staple line in lung tissue could preclude prolonged air leakage and thus eliminate extensive hospital stays. Additionally, such a material could also prove suitable for other operations where sealing and strengthening is desirable. In Rocky Mountain Biosystems, Inc.'s (RMBI) preliminary studies, a novel polymeric adhesive sealant and minimally-invasive curing system was tested extensively in vitro, then in vivo, and was shown to completely eliminate air leaks and provide substantial added strength to the staple line in lung tissue. The novel system uses a simple polymeric adhesive that is cured in place using a non-contact process of radiofrequency inductive coupling. The seals are tight and leak proof, materials and devices are inexpensive, and biocompatibility testing and sealing of tissues in vivo has proven the formulations are safe and efficacious. RMBI desires to continue the development and testing of this new surgical system in order to advance it closer to clinical trials and ultimately, marketability. In Phase II research, RMBI proposes to: 1. Engineer Slow Dissolution Polymer for Sustained Seal 2. Engineer Processes and Validate Polymer Production 3. Demonstrate Efficacious Seal in Emphysemic Animal Lung Model. The results of the proposed research will validate a unique, cost-effective solution to a persistent clinical problem that affects hundreds of thousands of patients every year. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Postoperative air leakage along the exposed staple line is the most frequent complication in all lung surgeries, occurring in 34% - 50% of patients, and resulting in prolonged hospital stays of 10 to12 days on average. The minimally invasive technique developed by the applicant incorporates an adhesive that quickly cures, thus precluding prolonged air leakage while buttressing the staple line and collateral tissue.",

        "abstract": "Situation or Problem: Commercial reforesters, nurseries and greenhouses are searching for ways to reduce labor and handling costs. As the industry has looked for ways to reduce labor and handling costs, growers have become more mechanized, increasingly using machines to move and transplant their plant stock. These machines cannot handle current loose soil processes. Therefore, the growing industry uses stabilized media, which is a pre-manufactured substrate (sometimes peat, composted bark and other organics; other times completely synthetic materials) bonded together into a composite structure by a polymer binder or glue. These synthetic materials and binders are often unfriendly to the environment and do not meet sustainability objectives. Additionally, many countries strictly control or prohibit the importation of growing media that contains any form of organic material such as peat moss, compost or tree bark. Rynel's Grow-Tech division manufactures stabilized media for the forestry, horticultural, and hydroponics markets. Our current product, the FlexiPlugr, is held together with petroleum-based polyurethane. While growers are satisfied with the performance of the FlexiPlug and it has one of the lowest plastic contents in the industry, the residual polyurethane still remains in the ground for some time. It is not feasible to recycle the polyurethane in growing media after the plant has been grown in it, as it would need to be separated from the organic matter (plant and substrate). Purpose: Rynel/Grow-Tech successfully completed a Phase I effort to utilize a biodegradable polymer, hereafter referred to as PLA (Polylactic Acid) as an alternative to polyurethane and peat in its stabilized media. PLA is a biodegradable polymer made from corn, grasses and other plant-based feedstocks to create plastics. The use of bio-based plastics, particularly in packaging and semi-durable goods, is increasing as manufacturers try to decrease their dependence on petroleum-based plastics, which are tied to the price and availability of oil. Bio-based are becoming more cost-competitive. Consumers are also demanding greener, more ecologically-friendly products. Since PLA is produced from the fermentation of starch-rich agricultural by-products and other renewable plant materials, PLA is a sustainable and renewable source for polymers. Rynel/Grow-Tech have successfully spun and extruded PLA-based non-wovens. We propose scaling up and refining these formulations to create a bio-based stabilized growing media for trees and plants. Commercial reforesters and nurseries prefer to start their seeds and cuttings in a renewable stabilized media-one that is at least bio-based if not also biodegradable and compostable. The purpose of this Phase II effort is to master production technologies, scale up production output and begin marketing a sustainable stabilized, biodegradable growing medium for all three Grades with a focus on the forestry market.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Phase II Childhood obesity is a growing and increasingly serious public health problem. Children's easy access to unhealthy foods at school may be contributing to high rates of childhood overweight and obesity. Samuels and Associates (SandA) seeks to address the issue of childhood obesity by developing a user- friendly and innovative assessment system that measures the nutritional quality of competitive foods sold on school campuses: the Food and Beverage Environment Assessment and Monitoring System (Food BEAMS). Food BEAMS would enable schools and other entities to effectively determine their adherence to nutrition standards, improve their nutrition environments, influence the development of healthy eating habits and ultimately slow the rates of childhood obesity. During Phase I, SandA successfully developed a Food BEAMS prototype which uses an observational data collection methodology to accurately catalogue competitive foods and beverages sold on school campuses, link to the nutrient database of competitive foods and beverages, and assess adherence to competitive food and beverage standards. The goal for Phase II is to develop a fully functional user-friendly software with the flexibility to analyze the nutritional quality of foods and beverages against multiple nutrition standards. Specifically, Phase II efforts will involve: re-configuring the technical application design to function in a central server and remote client format; improving the user interface to increase user-friendliness, decrease data entry time and decrease error; increasing the coverage and improving the management of the nutrient database within the system; and increasing the functionality of the system to enable users to adapt the adherence analysis to multiple nutrition standards. Finally, an experimental design will be employed to compare adherence to nutrition standards in high schools randomly assigned to use Food BEAMS and high schools randomly assigned as control sites. With the increasing number of nutrition policies at schools, health care institutions and government agencies, there is a growing market for tools that help with implementation and monitoring of nutrition standards. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This application will support the development of an innovative and user-friendly data collection and analysis tool, the Food and Beverage Analysis and Measurement System (Food BEAMS) that can be used by non-researchers such as government agencies, public health advocates and school personnel to easily and accurately assess competitive school foods and beverages and their adherence to nutrition standards. Use of this product on a national level will increase monitoring of adherence to nutrition standards and has the potential to improve the school food environment, provide students with healthier choices, influence the development of healthy eating habits among youth and ultimately slow the rates of childhood obesity.",

The team has developed the world's highest-frequency mechanical resonator and will use this device to create RF filters for wireless communications in the 100 MHz to 3 GHz range. Building on the simulation results and optimal device designs the team will fabricate, test and characterize nanomechanical filters for use in wireless communication devices. There is a significant problem that designers of cellular handsets and other wireless devices are facing when adding additional air interfaces such as WiFi, WiMax, Bluetooth and Global Position Service (GPS) into their products. Each additional air interface requires a new set of RF filters and as the number of air interfaces multiplies the number of conventional filters required increases dramatically. The goals of the Phase-II project are to (i) develop nanomechanical filters in the 100 MHz - 3 GHz range; (ii) test and characterize the device for optimal performance parameters; (iii) transfer the manufacturing process to a commercial foundry for wafer-level fabrication; (iv) package the devices using wafer-level packaging in an external foundry.  If successful this technology will allow the replacement of existing discreet filters in cell phones and other mobile wireless devices with the ability to access many different air interfaces with excellent radio performance. This innovative technology will impact many industries that operate on wireless technology. Also the product will be used in cell phones thus having world wide impact.",

        "abstract": "Biodiesel is a renewable substitute and additive for petroleum diesel and its use can improve air quality, combat climate change and increase national energy security. The current biodiesel production methods are not well suited for efficient, large-scale continuous production and improved technology is needed. Recent Phase I research findings from SarTec Corporation demonstrate that biodiesel can be rapidly produced from a variety of feedstocks using heterogeneous zirconia catalysts in continuous-flow, fixed-bed reactors (The Mcgyan process). At elevated temperatures and pressures, efficient conversion of triglycerides and fatty acids to biodiesel (which met ASTM D 6751 quality standards) was achieved. Furthermore there was minimal pressure drop across the reactor bed and purposely-fouled catalyst was easily regenerated to its original activity. During Phase II work, we propose to further advance the development of this biodiesel production technology. Emphasis will be placed upon expanding the Mcgyan process so it can be used to process large quantities of high free fatty acid containing lipid feedstocks especially those that are solid or semi-solid at room temperature. We also wish to conduct a more complete mass and energy balance of a pilot scale production system as a prologue to full scale design, production and commercialization. When fully developed, The Mcgyan process will overcome the most significant limitations currently encountered by the biodiesel industry, namely the difficulty in using inexpensive feedstocks that contain high levels of free fatty acids, the necessity of continually adding catalyst to a batch mode process, and eliminating the need for extensive washing of the biodiesel with water. Therefore in addition to the advantage of converting high free fatty acid feedstocks to biodiesel, another major advantage of the Mcgyan process is water conservation. The proposed production technology will stimulate use of inexpensive feedstocks and lower the cost of biodiesel production. Successful development of this technology will change the economics of biodiesel production and expand its role as a renewable, environmentally friendly biofuel.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this Phase II proposal is to evaluate Scarab Genomics' improved E. coli production strains in  real world  conditions under which pharmacological grade therapeutic proteins and plasmid DNA are produced. In some cases this will be done in collaboration with contract manufacturers using GMP facilities. Candidate proteins and plasmids will be obtained through collaborations with biotech companies which are developing pharmaceuticals that could be manufactured with Scarab's Clean Genome(r) E. coli strains.        Since 1982, when the FDA approved human insulin produced by E. coli for marketing, E. coli fermentation has been a preferred and cost-effective method for commercial production of therapeutic DNA and proteins. Many innovations have been made to the expression systems used with E. coli, but the actual bacteria used commercially had not been basically improved since the 1970's until Scarab's scarless genomic deletion technology made it possible to systematically revise the genome of E. coli.        This technology has enabled Scarab to create  reduced genome  strains of E. coli that lack many genes (up to 20% of the chromosome) that are not beneficial for commercial applications. The  clean genome  strains have improved metabolic efficiency and product yield, increased clone stability and have eliminated many undesired fermentation side products including phage, flagellae, fimbrae, transposases and in some cases, toxins.        Phase I of this project dealt with the problem of limiting the most serious E.coli toxin, endotoxin (also called lipopolysacharide or LPS), which is present at full strength in all currently used E. coli production strains. The FDA places strict limits on endotoxin levels in pharmaceuticals. Endotoxin cannot be completely eliminated because the genes coding for the core LPS structure are essential for growth, but discoveries made in Phase I led to genetic mutations reducing the level of endotoxin substantially. The best of our low endotoxin E. coli, when injected into mice, decreases mortality by more than 10-fold over the ordinary E. coli currently used in production.        It is hoped that this Phase II project will lead to an FDA application for clinical trial of at least one pharmaceutical product produced by a Scarab strain from one of our collaborators. A demonstration that Scarab's strain has been FDA approved will remove a significant barrier to our marketing, namely the conservative perception that what has been approved before is good enough.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Plasmid DNA and protein generated from bacterial fermentation is subject to stringent purity constraints because of the potential for contamination of samples with impurities that include endotoxin. Because of the health risk of therapeutics that contain impurities like endotoxin and due to the high cost of purification, generating bacterial strains that reduce impurity carryover and toxicity are of tremendous value to the biologic and pharmaceutical industry.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II research project proposes to develop Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) instruments capable of measuring fine particles in suspensions beyond the limits of current technology. By simultaneous or independent use of three innovative techniques, larger detection aperture, smaller field size, and optical, homodyne amplification, the team can now measure hydrodynamic radius over greater ranges of particle size and concentration than was formerly possible. Two key ideas for this effort are: 1) the construction of a numerical model of the complex phenomenology of DLS with eight free and independent parameters; 2) the ability to apply this new understanding to the quantitative analysis of existing instruments, and to optimize new system designs for extended applications. These ideas have been confirmed empirically, correctly defining operational boundaries, formerly less well understood and quantified. A key advantage is the ability to design DLS systems with superior ranges of performance, versatility, accuracy, and cost, noting especially that deeper understanding improves performance and reduces error limits of reported data.  Newly capable and economical instruments are made available for characterizing suspended colloidal particles, from sub-nanometer to micron radii and from almost opaque to almost completely transparent. Extended capabilities include process control of high concentration colloidal materials, common in manufacturing from paint to chemical machining slurries, from foodstuff to pharmaceuticals. At the opposite end of the spectrum of difficultly lie suspensions scattering very little light, such as\nproteinaceous drugs, fuel cell catalysts, and many other materials of great interest to in-vivo non-invasive measurement of small sample volumes. Aside from a ready market in both real time monitoring and offline analysis for quality control in existing industrial processes, the extended capabilities offer attractive research opportunities into the properties of nanomaterials, a burgeoning field of interest and importance. Such instruments and their enhanced capability will increase materials research opportunities and be economical enough to use in a teaching environment, significantly augmenting the many and complex technologies already used for the assessment of these important materials. In contrast with more invasive measurements that may require dilution or evaporation for sample preparation irrevocably altering what is to be measured, extended DLS techniques complement and may be applied to undisturbed samples as small as a picoliter.",

        "abstract": "With the drive toward higher-field dipole magnets, material requirements for superconductors are becoming stringent.  Although the processing and application of existing metal-based materials have advanced to a significantly higher level than those of their ceramic high-critical-temperature counterparts, these counterparts have exhibited higher critical field values.  Therefore, the ceramic superconductor, bismuth strontium calcium copper oxide (BSCCO-2212), in the form of a multifilamentary Ag alloy composite, is beginning to attract the interest of the DOE.  This project will produce a commercially viable BSCCO-2212/Ag composite multifilamentary round wire with a Jc value exceeding 2100 A/mm2 and Je value equal to or exceeding 600 A/mm2 at 12T and 4.2K.  In addition, the powder processing conditions for the BSCCO-2212 powder, needed to maximize the uniformity of the Jc and Je throughout the length of the composite wire, will be determined.  In Phase I, an understanding of the effect of powder calcining conditions on the powder properties and the wire fabrication process was developed.  In addition, a wire fabrication process was demonstrated, in which composite wires free of superconductor phase leakage were produced.  In Phase II, the superconductor properties of the composite wire will be further improved by tailoring the powder processing method.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The initial commercial application of BSCCO-2212/Ag composite wire should be in high field magnets for high energy physics experimentation.  Other uses of the technology should include medical MRI and other commercial applications where high field magnets are required.",

Despite the tremendous improvements in coating technologies to enable huge increases in operational temperatures, continued advances using conventional, purely materials-science approaches have resulted in diminishing marginal returns in the last 25 years. The problem is that the turbine blades heat up as a result of radiative and conductive heat transport. Using MEMS-fabrication methods, we will develop a technique to coat the blades with Bragg reflectors, tailored to the spectrum of the radiation, that will decrease the thermal radiation from the surface to the turbine blades tenfold, thereby providing the means to (1) increase turbine-blade lifetime; and (2) attain considerably higher operating efficiencies by operating the engines at significantly higher temperatures. In our baseline Phase II program we will (1) demonstrate an optimal system-fabricated utilizing MEMS technology-that is designed to minimize radiative heat transport; and (2) demonstrate low-thermal-conductivity TBCs that reduce conductive heat transport. In addition, should our Phase II optional tasks be funded we will develop smart erosion sensors and microstructure with decreased thermal conductivity.",

        "abstract": "The Alaskan fishing industry produces over one million metric tons of by-product and waste annually. Rural coastal Alaska communities have been using the grind and dump method for decades. There is an opportunity to expand existing onshore processing in rural coastal communities and provide additional economic value from fish waste and, simultaneously, reducing or eliminating the impact of current fish waste disposal practices on the local community. There are more than 200 fish processing plants in Alaska, however, fish waste processing occurs at only ten of largest shore-based plants that extract fish meal and fish oil for use as aquaculture feed ingredients for fish and shrimp and as livestock and poultry feed ingredients. These waste processing facilities process 400 metric ton (400 MT) of waste per day, or more. The cost for these plants is several million dollars, they require a tremendous volume of fish that is only available at a small number of ports, and they are expensive to operate. In addition, the fish processing plants with waste recovery facilities focus the majority of their processing on Pollock and Cod, with only a fraction of their throughput dedicated to salmon. The majority of the smaller processing plants are dominated by the seasonal salmon processing, which makes the economics of these ventures more difficult. For years there has been a need to develop fish waste processing equipment that is significantly smaller and less expensive than current systems, opening up the opportunity for more than 100 smaller seafood processing plants to extract greater value from their product. Despite many feasibility analyses that have been conducted over the past twenty years, affordable fish waste processing equipment with a small footprint has not been introduced and demonstrated that can serve these smaller rural coastal processors because of a combination of high risk and lack of capital. Recently, the prices for the two primary salmon byproducts, meal and oil, have increased dramatically because the marketplace places a premium on human-grade salmon oil and salmon meal. The demand for Wild Alaskan Salmon meal and oil has changed the economic potential for processing salmon waste at lower volumes at the smaller scale seafood processing plants that serve rural coastal Alaska.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): SCR, Inc. (Louisville, KY) is developing a chronic implantable CPD system to treat HF patients who may be responsive to long-term counterpulsation support. The CPD has been developed for superficial implantation via a pacemaker incision without the need to enter the chest and enables complete patient mobility. The CPD is a 32-ml stroke volume polyurethane-lined blood chamber designed to fit comfortably in a subcutaneous pocket on the right anterior chest contralateral to an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) or biventricular pacer device implantation site. The pumping chamber is connected to the systemic circulation by a short ePTFE graft anastomosed to the axillary artery. The CPD is controlled by a small, wearable pneumatic driver, connected by a percutaneous air line, and triggered by the patient's ECG. The CPD fills during native heart systole lowering ventricular workload, and ejects during diastole augmenting myocardial and end-organ perfusion. In the phase I study, the hemodynamic efficacy of the 32-ml CPD driver was equivalent to a standard commercially-available 40-ml IABP in a large animal model (n=12) over a range of physiologic conditions (hypotension, hypertenstion, and heart failure) demonstrating feasibility. In this phase II study, the development and testing of the CPD driver will be completed to support a future FDA submission. This objective will be accomplished by (1) completing engineering development, (2) demonstrating reliability and ergonomics, and (3) demonstrating long-term safety of the CPD driver. Results of a pivotal Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) study will be completed with a summary report prepared for submission to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to request approval for clinical trials. The program detailed here leverages the development work of SCR and the engineering and development teams at Abiomed (Danvers, MA). This partnership will be assisted and guided by an innovative group of physicians at Jewish Hospital (Louisville, KY) and a world class research team in the Cardiovascular Innovation Institute (CII) at the University of Louisville (UofL).

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop and prototype passive UHF RFID tags implemented with strong public key cryptography for the pharmaceutical industry. Implementing cryptography directly on passive tags is a significant innovation as current security solutions cannot address this need effectively. The FDA is urging the United States pharmaceutical industry to adopt RFID technology to assist with the enforcement of pedigree laws and reduce drug counterfeiting. Today's RFID tags, however, cannot protect the user from unauthorized reading, copying, or tracking because they lack onboard security. Thus, a large exposure remains since the security of the data on the tag cannot be ensured.  SecureRF is developing a security protocol which holds the promise of beings thousands of times smaller and faster than any other cryptographic function.  Secured tags will enable drug manufacturers and distributors to ensure patient safety and drug integrity as well as improve their supply chain process.  This SBIR project targets the pharmaceutical industry supply chain which handles over 4 billion U.S. prescriptions annually. Pharmaceuticals must be protected from counterfeiting and theft which impacts public safety and drives up consumer drug prices. Without onboard security, the FDA's\nrecommended use of RFID tags could inadvertently introduce new societal threats including patient privacy concerns under HIPAA. The use of secure RFID tags will also enable the pharmaceutical industry to run their supply chain more efficiently. Additional commercial value from this project will come from developing secure products for high value asset tracking and contact-less payment systems in addition to military and Homeland Security needs. Existing cryptographic algorithms cannot provide strong authentication and data protection on resource-constrained computing devices like passive RFID tags. This SBIR proposal offers a breakthrough with broad-based significance that will help advance the technological understanding of public key cryptography for small, low powered computing devices.",

        "abstract": "Aflatoxin was discovered in groundnut meal which killed over 10,000 turkeys in England. Poultry are extremely sensitive to aflatoxin B1 with turkeys being more sensitive than chickens. Later research discovered that poultry are the most susceptible food animal species to the toxic effects of aflatoxin. Based on epidemiological data and knowledge of liver biochemistry it is suggested that humans fall somewhere in the middle of this lethality range. Lethality in humans has also been documented. In 1974, nearly 10 per cent of 1,000 patients died from suspected acute aflatoxin poisoning. Aflatoxicosis outbreaks (2004) in eastern Kenya resulted in 317 cases and 125 deaths. Specific medical implications of aflatoxin are related to their carcinogenic properties. Aflatoxin is listed as a Group I carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. It is has been demonstrated in animal species to be the most potent liver carcinogen known, and is implicated as a cause of human primary heptatocellular carcinoma. This form of cancer is one of the most common forms of cancer in China, Saharan Africa, and Southeast Asia and causes at least 250,000 deaths annually worldwide, especially in developing countries. The human body also metabolizes aflatoxin to several compounds including aflatoxin M1 which is secreted in both mother?s milk and urine. Studies in Africa confirm infant exposure to aflatoxin via mother?s milk as well as the ability of aflatoxin in blood to cross the human placenta. Approximately 4.5 billion people around the world are exposed to virtually unregulated amounts of the toxin on a daily basis. The substance is so toxic that it is one of 19 contaminants along with mercury and DDT for which the US Food and Drug Administration imposes strict tolerance levels with only trace amounts allowed. In addition to the health impact of detecting the mycotoxins early, there is a significant economic impact. The Midwest drought in 2005 triggered an outbreak of poisonous aflatoxin at thousands of corn farms, spurring regulators and food companies to greatly expand testing of grain and milk. During the last US drought, many dairies were forced to dump aflatoxin-contaminated milk from cows fed corn contaminated with this toxin. The concern for aflatoxin-contaminated corn led company officials at the Quaker Oats breakfast cereal plant in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, to assay every truckload of corn entering the plant for aflatoxin. The value of this solution is evident by the fact that two major grain storage companies are committed to serve as beta test sites for the product.",

This line of micropump systems will provide pulse-free flow and controlled micro-volume dispensing in this challenging low volume regime. The non-mechanical nature and operating principles of this pump afford an unusual degree of freedom in pump design. The ability to tailor the shape and size of the micropump to specific applications can be very valuable, particularly in small devices where the available space is significantly constrained (for example, point-of-care devices, portable chemical and biological analysis systems, and micro-dosing devices).  There is a growing diversity of chemical and biological analyses that are taking place within small chips, as well as in the rising demand for ultra-small dosing systems. Such analyses are continuing to shrink in size and measurements that have conventionally been performed in a laboratory and are now being adapted to handheld devices. These micro-analysis systems can provide immediate results without waiting for laboratory analyses. For example, the analysis of blood samples is being adapted to small devices, so important\nresults are available at the point-of-care. Likewise, the desire is growing for small, portable dosing systems for animal studies and for human medications (like insulin and chronic pain management). All of these applications require micropumps for the controlled delivery of compounds. Fundamental engineering constraints mean that conventional mechanical pumps cannot be simply decreased in size to meet this challenge. These miniature non-mechanical pumps require very little power, can be controlled to deliver at constant flow rate or specific dispensing volumes, and offer the pulse-less flow that is not accessible by other pumps. This provides a significant market opportunity in the liquid pumping market (roughly $160 million presently), into the animal dosing (valued at approximately $90 million per year) and human drug delivery (valued at $80 billion presently) markets.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project proposes a framework to support product development, analysis, and decision making in multi-domain engineering environments through domain-unified product models. Ad hoc and even formal (standards-based) product data models, subject to the need for multiple views and attributes to support domain-specific application requirements, suffer from data redundancy and consistency problems. These problems are exacerbated by the implicit nature of information in geometric representation schemes and the difficulty and latency of its access. The intellectual merit of the work lies in the ability of the developed formalism to support the simultaneous generation and maintenance of multiple views of product model data, and the enforcement of consistency between them. A framework is proposed to manage the complexity of model synchronization and view-generation with the domain-unified modeling environment through the active management of constraints and goals for model population and transformation. The framework is to be validated within the context of an environment for the creation, management, and distribution of domain-unified models of packaged electronic components.The broader impact of this work accrues from the application of the domain-unified modeling methodology to packaged components for printed electronic assemblies (PCAs). The design of electronic products is realized through a combination of electronic design\nautomation (EDA) software tools and computer-aided design (CAD) tools that support a wide variety of inter-related design and analysis disciplines spanning the electronic and mechanical domains (e.g. functional, layout, thermal, manufacturability). These tools are critically dependent on the availability of accurate computer-interpretable models of packaged electronic components. Due to the absence of accepted modeling standards, a lack of effective tools for the creation, maintenance, and distribution of component data, and a lack of interoperability across EDA and CAD tools. The proposed domain-unified modeling tools and data services will enable OEMs to more efficiently mange and distribute component information within their enterprises, OEMs and designers to leverage collective efforts in component modeling, and provide efficient mechanisms for the communication of data between component suppliers and OEMs.",

        "abstract": "For advanced magnets used in high energy physics research, commercially available NB3Sn superconductor wire needs to have smaller superconducting filament regions, while retaining a high critical current density (Jc).  However, the currently available Nb bars used in such conductors have a large grain structure, which cause poor deformation behavior as the Nb is worked into fine filaments in Nb-Sn-Cu composite wire.  When isolated Nb filaments deform irregularly, they can break or contact other nearby filaments, which decreases conductor performance.  In this project, the problem of large grains in the starting Nb will be addressed by breaking up the original coarse and nonuniform microstructure with carefully applied plastic deformation and annealing.  These procedures can be applied via Equal channel angular extrusion (ECAE) at high efficiency and reasonable cost.  The approach demonstrated in Phase I included (1) processing bulk Nb to a fine-grained microstructure, (2) observing improved deformation behavior of grain-refined Nb in Cu-Nb composite wire, and (3) demonstrating a high yield of fully-worked material for multipass ECAE processing of single bars.  In Phase II, the equipment for ECAE processing will be scaled up, tested, and evaluated for economic viability.  The larger equipment will be used to produce large fine-grained Nb bars for prototype Nb3Sn conductor experiments.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The technology should be suitable for the commercial production of advanced high Jc, fine-filament Nb3Sn wire for high energy physics and fusion energy applications.  In addition, the ECAE approach should be applicable to the fabrication of Ta, Ti, interstitial free steel, and superalloys, with improved mechanical properties for a host of applications.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Naturally occurring smallpox has been eradicated but remains a credible threat to the security of the United States due to its potential use as an agent of terror or biowarfare. Given that approximately 25% of the population is contraindicated to receive the vaccine due to direct risk of adverse events or the possibility of placing direct contacts at risk (23), the current smallpox vaccine is inadequate to protect the US population from smallpox. SIGA Technologies (SIGA) is currently conducting NDA-enabling activities seeking FDA approval for ST-246 as a post-exposure therapeutic for smallpox. SIGA is seeking to expand ST-246 indications for use to include it as an adjunct to smallpox vaccination to prevent or treat adverse events due to the vaccine. We and our collaborators have demonstrated in more than 30 animal studies that ST-246 is safe and very effective for the prevention or treatment of orthopoxvirus infection, including variola, the causative agent of smallpox. This suggested to us that ST-246 might also be used to prevent or treat adverse events due to the smallpox vaccine, a live vaccinia virus closely related to variola. We have demonstrated in immunocompetent mice (14) and monkeys that reactogenicity to the vaccine is reduced while protective immunity elicited by the vaccine is not affected. Further, in our Phase I studies, as reported in the Progress Report below, we have determined that ST-246 provides full protection from lethal poxvirus challenge in numerous murine models of immunodeficiency and that immunodeficient mice may be safely vaccinated if treated with ST-246 as an adjunct to the vaccine. Immunodeficient mice that are safely vaccinated are subsequently resistant to lethal challenge suggesting that remaining components of the immune system are able to mediate protection. ST-246 is a promising candidate for inclusion in the Strategic National Stockpile as a component of the Smallpox Response Plan to 1) provide protection from smallpox if an individual is exposed and 2) reduce the occurrence of adverse events due to vaccination. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The objective of this proposal is to advance ST-246 development as an adjunct to the smallpox vaccine through the pre-clinical development phase so that an Investigational New Drug (IND) application may be filed with the Food and Drug Administration upon completion of the proposed studies.",

Studies performed in the Phase I proposal demonstrate that IPC analogs have a wide spectrum of anti-inflammatory activities with a superior safety profile to glucocorticoids. Signum's proof of concept IPC analog, AFC, inhibited erythema (redness) in a double blind, vehicle controlled cosmetic human use study. More potent IPC analogs serve as attractive drug development candidates for reducing erythema and treating rosacea. Several IPC analogs identified from Signum's screening program are attractive candidates for preclinical development. The proposed Phase II research plan will identify one lead compound and two backups for preclinical development and will establish the analytical methods, process development and formulation that are necessary. Furthermore, these studies will determine the preclinical safety profile of the lead compound by performing metabolic, pharmacokinetic, toxicology and safety pharmacology studies. Together, the data generated from these studies will allow Signum to prepare and submit an IND for treatment of rosacea. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rosacea is a common, chronic cutaneous condition afflicting millions of individuals. FDA approved treatments have yielded mixed results, often leaving patients with significant levels of facial redness. Successful pharmaceutical development of IPC analog anti-inflammatories will provide an important additional, and potentially better, therapeutic option for people suffering from rosacea redness.",

During Phase I of this SBIR Silverchair Science and Communications, in partnership with the University of Virginia, developed a prototype point-of-care computer software application to enhance clinician effectiveness in smoking intervention at the primary care level called QuitAdvisorMD. QuitAdvisorMD distills recommended guidelines and evidence based practices into a practical, streamlined, patient tailored, electronic resource that is easy to use, intuitive, and rapidly accessible to busy clinicians at the point of care. The tools content is based on evidence-based practice guidelines; motivational interviewing; and the stage-based behavior change. During Phase II Silverchair will develop QuitAdvisorMD into a robust platform suitable for commercial use. The University of Virginia will conduct a randomized controlled trial to measure QuitAdvisorMD's impact on increasing the number patients who receive appropriate smoking cessation counseling sessions initiated by primary care physicians.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Motivational Interviewing (MI) is a widely used empirically-supported intervention for substance abuse, yet little is known about methods for training this complex treatment among the front-line clinicians who are now being asked to employ it. The available research indicates that the most common methods for training counselors in MI do not sufficiently elicit the level of competence required for clinical trials, where efficacy of this method has been demonstrated. Innovative and economical technologies that assist counselors in acquiring competence in MI would address this gap between the laboratory and clinic for this empirically-based treatment. The primary goal of this STRR Phase II grant is to develop and test an innovative training program based on the SIMmersion LLC simulation software system. Based on a Phase I prototype, SIMmersion, with the assistance of Dr. Theresa Moyers (University of New Mexico) will create a system that will augment workshop training in MI. Dr. Moyers and her research team will conduct a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the training system's efficacy. After receiving MI training at a standard two-day workshop on motivational interviewing techniques, participants will receive the MI simulation training system or self-paced, paper-and- pencil learning materials. A standardized behavioral coding system will be used to evaluate the clinician- participant's recorded therapy sessions in order to 1) evaluate the impact of the training sessions on intended skill acquisition by clinicians and 2) examine differences between the groups in both skill acquisition and maintenance over a six month period. This training system will then be marketed to schools of medicine, nursing, social work, allied health American graduate medical education approved residency programs, US-based health care systems, and CE (continuing education) programs in the US. In addition, the simulation training system will be marketed to similar medical training functions in Western and Eastern Europe, Canada and Latin America. The simulated patient program, using the SIMmersion technology, is expected to significantly advance our ability to train medical professionals in human processing and interaction skills. We expect the end result of the grant will include improved MI skills among substance abuse clinicians that will lead to improved patient outcomes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Motivational Interviewing (MI) has been shown to be a very effective technique for providing substance abuse intervention, particularly with individuals who are ambivalent about changing. However, these techniques require extensive practice, which is difficult and expensive to obtain after initial training. The proposed research will produce an innovative new training tool with the potential to increase learning and retention of MI skills among clinicians, thereby benefiting their patients.",

Technology is being increasingly incorporated into the process, especially in minimally invasive procedures in the form of computer-based interactive skills trainers. Yet the majority of surgery is still performed through open-incision access and there are no simulation-based training systems available for this training. The foundation for open surgery training is wound closure and this is the simulation that will be built in this proposal. This work builds upon earlier prototype work that has proved the fundamental concept is possible. Taking that as a starting point, this effort will refine physics-based simulation of tool-tissue interaction and implement training content for wound closure that conforms with recently announced curricula for surgical resident training. The underlying simulator architecture that results will serve as a platform for additional training content in the future. The outcome of this proposal will be a cost appropriate simulator that is ready to go to the next stage of commercialization, where it can meet the needs of surgeons in addition to those of many other groups of healthcare professionals who need basic wound closure training.",

In Phase I, we developed partial atomic charges including s and p components, atomic and molecular reactivities, and related descriptors from a dataset of almost 700 molecules. In Phase II we will augment the dataset with additional elements and complete the development of the charge model. Improved descriptor selection algorithms will be developed to capture the maximum information content of the new descriptors in model building. New and improved models for ADMET properties will be built using in-house and publicly available data sources. The models and new descriptors will be embodied in our commercially available software already in use by organizations worldwide to provide rapid and accurate estimation of ADMET properties to help prioritizing drug candidates for synthesis and screening. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Quantum level chemical descriptors have been demonstrated to provide improved predictions of ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity) properties in our Phase I effort. While traditional methods for calculating these descriptors from 3-dimensional molecular structures perform at a rate of only about one molecule per day, our Phase I approach enables calculation of these descriptors at the rate of hundreds of thousands of molecules per hour.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Sixty-three percent of U.S. hospitals treat LEP patients daily or weekly. SimulTel, Inc. ( SimulTel ) is an innovative technology company founded to enhance efficiency, improve accuracy, and lower costs of interpreting in health care by facilitating the use of remote simultaneous medical interpreting ( RSMI ). Conventional medical interpreting is consecutive. The interpreting occurs after the speaker has completed speaking, necessitating that the speakers pause for the interpreter. In simultaneous interpreting, the interpreter interprets at the same time as s/he is hearing the original speech, as in the United Nations, where simultaneous voice-over interpreting is provided as delegates speak. Recently published research has shown that the use of RSMI results in significantly fewer medical errors and is faster than usual and customary interpreting methods. Patient satisfaction is also higher with RSMI. SimulTel proposes to enable health care facilities across the United States to offer RSMI to their LEP patients. This interpreting method will be made accessible by: (1) Enabling health care facilities to flexibly expand, maximize utilization of, and 'RSMI-enable' their own interpreting resources, and (2) Partnering with over-the-phone interpreting providers. During the proposed SBIR grant period, we will: (1) Determine feasibility of, and requirements for, health care facilities serving large LEP populations to RSMI-enable their interpreters through a new large- scale, multi-entity, Web-based system that can be delivered in a 'Software as a Service' model; (2) Design, develop and test the technology platform; and (3) Deploy and evaluate RSMI at participating health care facilities. The study will be conducted at three health care systems and a fourth hospital in the New York Metropolitan Area, representing a varied group of hospitals, ambulatory clinics, and nursing facilities. The health care facilities care for some of the most diverse communities in the United States, with 20-55% of their patients having limited English proficiency. Further, we will ensure that a skilled pool of interpreters, able to deliver quality interpreting, is housed on this technological innovation. To do so, we will also develop and test an online interpreter training module that will be a scalable system to efficiently train bilingual persons in RSMI. A rigorous evaluation will be conducted that examines the service, software and training program. This will include pre- and post-tests on interpreting skills and knowledge, setting up trial testbeds to extensively evaluate the system behavior and performance, reviewing system logs, quality of the service, patient satisfaction, provider satisfaction, monitoring the system and utilization statistics. SimulTel brings together a multidisciplinary team representing complementary and integrated expertise in immigrant health, linguistics and interpreting, communications technology and software development, and online education to develop, test, and disseminate a much-needed technological innovation to address the language barrier in health care.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This proposal describes the research required to design, simulate and manufacture ultra-low power circuitries to be used in a complete transceiver implanted inside the human body. Currently, it is difficult to communicate with devices implanted within the human body and the present commercial technologies do not adequately fill this need. We have identified that circuits using SJT Micropower proprietary MESFET technologies will have a lower current draw resulting in longer lifetimes than conventional devices and will be more suited for implanted devices. In order to improve communication with implanted devices, the FCC implemented the Medical Implant Communications Service (MICS) which is an ultra-low power, unlicensed, mobile radio service for transmitting data in support of diagnostic or therapeutic functions associated with implanted medical devices [1]. The FCC rules require that devices operating in the MICS frequency band of 402-405 MHz are limited to a bandwidth of 300kHz and maximum effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP) of 25 microwatts [1]. During Phase 1 research, we have demonstrated a novel MESFET based output stage and an industry leading phase locked loop frequency synthesizer operating between 402-405MHz. These circuits utilize our patented MESFET transistors, operate with less than 2mA and are the backbone circuitry of a transmitter. SJT Micropower will microfabricate the transmitter circuits from Phase 1 along with additional circuitries for a complete transceiver design during Phase 2. The following Phase 2 objectives will lead to a complete transceiver prototype: Objective 1) Finalize Output Transmitter Section - Frequency Synthesizer and Buffer from Phase 1 Objective 2) Design and Fabricate Input Receiver Stage - LNA Front End Objective 3) Design and Fabricate Backend Receiver Circuitry Objective 4) Integrate all Transceiver Circuitries and Build Final Prototype This device will be implanted within the human body and will improve patients' quality of life. Our technology advantages include the ability to operate with high voltage swings which will decrease the current draw of the output buffer, the ability to provide easier bias circuitry which will reduce component count, the ability to match the impedance of the transceiver antenna without additional matching circuitry and a possibility for lower noise circuitry than conventional MOSFETs. These all result in lower current draw from an implanted battery during data transmission and directly increase the useful lifetime of both the battery and implanted transceiver. In addition, our technology is fabricated on radiation hard SOI processes and does not suffer from ionizing radiation effects which can cripple medical circuitry that must last for many years. We have obtained strong support from microfabrication foundries, design consultants, medical device manufacturers and end users. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Currently, it is difficult for medical devices implanted within the human body to communicate with medical professionals in the outside world. This research will utilize the Medical Implant Communications Service (MICS) to build a novel low power transceiver which will allow physicians the ability to use wireless technology to diagnose and treat their patients. The final devices will permit faster data transfer rates between medical implants and external monitoring/control equipment, consume less power than existing solutions therefore requiring fewer replacement procedures, allow for less patient trauma, have a lower cost per survival day, reduce the risk of infection to patients, enhance the comfort of patients, and expand the freedom of movement of medical personnel working with the equipment [2].",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): SmartCells is developing SmartInsulin?,which is intended to be a once-a-day, self- regulating insulin injection for the treatment of Type I diabetes. It is designed as a  drop- in  replacement product for the 4 million insulin-using diabetics in the United States. SmartInsulin is designed to provide significant benefits to insulin-dependent diabetics including fewer injections, less frequent blood sugar monitoring, reduced incidence of low blood sugar levels and single-dose control of both fasting and mealtime blood sugar levels. SmartInsulin is a nanostructured material that self-assembles from two biomolecular building blocks: a glycosylated insulin-polymer conjugate (IPC) and a multivalent glucose-binding molecule (GBM). The work covered in this submission is built on the successful results of a two-year NIH SBIR Phase 1 grant, an NIH SBIR Phase 2 grant, and preliminary results from a DOD grant regarding the safety and efficacy of SmartInsulin in large animal models. These results show that SmartInsulin has met its  proof-of-concept  technical goals, but IND- enabling studies must be conducted in order to bring SmartInsulin to the clinic. This requires very detailed and expensive GLP toxicity/ADME studies and a GMP manufacturing process. This project is intended to provide a clear path to IND-enabling GLP preclinical studies for SmartInsulin. In this grant application, SmartCells aims to qualify and validate the necessary pharmacology assays, conduct GLP-pharmacology, toxicity, and pharmacokinetic/ADME studies, leading to an IND submission with the FDA. The impacts to public health as a result of this project are potentially significant. Poor glycemic control has been shown to cause a host of diabetic complications which result in over  54 billion annually in medical costs. The landmark Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) and the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) have clinically proven that tighter glycemic control, as measured by lower glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels, significantly reduces the incidence of these complications. SmartInsulin is designed to provide tighter glycemic control, lowered HbA1c levels, and thus decreased incidence of diabetic complications.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Trends in HIV infection and prevention are changing. Although a growing number of prevention efforts have demonstrated efficacy, positive intervention effects have not been as evident among the populations currently at greatest risk, particularly women and people of color. While prevention has until recently focused on HIV- negative persons, the need to also target HIV-positives is increasingly being recognized. HIV researchers and practitioners are also turning attention to the potential of  structural interventions  (e.g., policies and laws, organizational procedures, media campaigns, environmental interventions) to have synergistic effects with the prevailing  behavioral interventions  that target individuals and small groups. The proposed project will provide HIV prevention professionals with key resources that facilitate access to, replication of, and re-evaluation of efficacious behavioral and structural HIV prevention interventions. These resources will update, expand, augment, and complement Sociometrics' existing HIV/AIDS Prevention Program Archive (HAPPA), a widely- disseminated collection of replication kits for efficacious behavioral prevention programs targeting HIV-negative adults. Specifically, the project will (1) update HAPPA with (new) efficacious behavioral programs for HIV- negative adults; (2) expand the HAPPA collection to include efficacious prevention programs for HIV-positive adults; (3) develop a research-based Program Adaptation Toolkit, in a customized version for each HAPPA kit and a stand-alone version for use with efficacious programs acquired elsewhere; (4) develop a complementary Compendium of Effective Structural Interventions that includes the content and describes the impact of empirically-validated structural interventions; and (5) develop an Online Selection Resource to help users identify empirically-validated behavioral and structural interventions suited to their needs and local contexts. In Phase I, efficacious interventions were identified and selected by a Scientist Expert Panel and agreements negotiated with their developers to acquire, package, and disseminate them should the current Phase II proposal be funded. Prototypes of all products were developed and subjected to usability testing with HIV prevention professionals. In Phase II, program packages will be developed for the new interventions, product prototypes will be modified per the results of the Phase I usability tests and then developed in their entirety, a second round of usability tests will be conducted on all products, and a field test in real world settings will be conducted to asses the value added contributions of the augmented HAPPA replication kit (i.e., with customized Program Adaptation Toolkit) in helping to bridge the gap between Type 1 translation research (development of intervention programs shown to be efficacious in a research-controlled environments) and Type 2 translation research (appropriate use of effective interventions in the practitioner-controlled  real world ).     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: HIV/AIDS continues to be a deadly international disease. A vaccine has proved elusive thus far. Although a growing number of HIV behavioral prevention efforts have demonstrated evidence of efficacy, positive intervention effects have not been as evident among the populations currently at greatest risk, particularly women and people of color. Research suggests that prevention practitioners need additional resources to help them select, acquire, and appropriately tailor efficacious interventions for implementation with diverse target populations. In addition, although every new HIV infection begins with someone who is already infected, prevention efforts to date have largely focused on HIV-seronegative persons. The increasing recognition of the need to target prevention efforts to seropositive persons as well is notably reflected in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) HIV Prevention Strategic Plan: Extended Through 2010 where decreasing HIV risk behaviors among seropositive persons is listed as the first objective in the effort to attain Goal #1 of decreasing by 5% per year, or at least by 10% by 2010, the number of persons in the U.S. at high risk for acquiring or transmitting HIV (CDC, 2007a). Finally, there is increasing attention to the role of structural factorssuch as laws and policies, organizational protocols, environmental conditions, and broader social normsin influencing HIV risk behaviors. Structural interventions often have the potential to reach more people than behavioral interventions that target individuals and small groups, and can potentially achieve large effects. Greater access to information about effective structural interventions among practitioners and policy/advocacy professionals would facilitate their more widespread replication and re-evaluation in new settings. The proposed SBIR project will provide prevention practitioners and policy/advocacy professionals with key science-based resources to respond to the above current challenges in HIV prevention.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is now strong scientific support for the widespread implementation of proven, effective early intervention programs for young children with, or at risk for, developmental disability. However, in practice, programs that lack demonstrated effectiveness are often implemented, undermining the impact of early intervention. The long-term goal of the current project is to increase the likelihood that children ages 0-5 years with or at risk for developmental disability receive effective intervention services. To this end, the specific aims of the proposed Phase II work will be to fully develop and make ready for commercial dissemination three products for which prototypes already exist from RandD completed in Phase I and from prior successful Sociometrics products. The central product is the Early Intervention Program Archive to Reduce Developmental Disability (EIPARDD), which will consist of complete replication kits of all necessary materials (e.g., manuals, workbooks) to implement and evaluate an empirically-supported intervention. Interventions included in EIPARDD were identified through a comprehensive scientific literature search and extensive evaluation by an independent Expert Panel in Phase I. Access to 12 empirically-supported intervention programs was secured in Phase I, and a prototype kit for one EIPARDD program was constructed and favorably evaluated by consumers. The specific aim for Phase II is to make all materials for each program in EIPARDD ready for commercial distribution by the end of the grant period. The other two products enhance the use of EIPARDD by (1) facilitating the selection of the appropriate empirically-supported intervention program for a given need (including those not available as replication kits), through an online Early Intervention Program Selection Resource; and (2) promoting program fidelity and evaluation through a set of Early Intervention Program Implementation and Evaluation Tutorials that offer generalized and program- tailored implementation and evaluation information in online and USB flash drive formats. Specific Phase II aims are to make these two ancillary products ready for commercial distribution by the end of the grant period. Technical usability testing and consumer feedback will be used extensively throughout the process to ensure that all final products meet the needs of early intervention professionals. In addition, a mixed-method research study will be conducted to investigate the fidelity of implementing effective early intervention programs in new sites. The replication kits will be marketed to early intervention decision-makers at local, state and regional levels. The commercial market for these products is substantial with over 102,000 professionals working in early intervention under the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) Parts B and C, serving nearly one million children ages 0-5 years. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The EIPARDD and its associated products will promote public health in two key ways. It will: (1) offer more young children with or at risk of developmental delay and their families efficacious early intervention services, by providing EI decision-makers with an array of efficacious EI programs from which to easily and affordably select, implement, adapt, and evaluate their efforts as they deliver EI services, and (2) prepare current and aspiring EI specialists about effective EI programs for children with or at risk of developmental delays by offering early childhood faculty and trainers accessible and interactive research-based information for use in pre-service preparation, staff orientation, staff training. More widespread use, adaptation, and evaluation of efficacious EI programs for children with or at risk for developmental delay, and more highly skilled EI professionals, should be the result.",

        "abstract": "Well over 50 % of US land area constitutes low wind-speed sites, yet wind turbines are either not effective or only marginally effective in such low winds. To extract significantly more energy from such DOE Class 1 or Class 2 winds requires substantially increasing turbine blade rotor diameter (wind power is proportional to the square of the blade diameter). However, due to limitations on turbine blade tip speed, this cannot be done without significantly decreasing blade rotor rpm (blade tip speed is directly proportional to rotor rpm), which in turn, due to limitations on generator output at low rpm, is notoriously costly to do. This makes genuinely low wind-speed, wind-electric power conversion commercially impractical. A recently introduced generator design addresses this issue. However, further work to more fully characterize and further develop this design is required. As a result, R&D work is being proposed that will include generator prototype construction, and extensive testing and modeling.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Creature Control: Food for Thought is a health science curriculum supplement and obesity prevention unit tailored to be effective with American Indian (AI) students. It considers the AI experience as its frame of refere\nnce and much of the visual representation is inspired by American Indian culture. In Phase I, prototype games and a set of lesson plans were designed, developed and successfully field tested by a team of teachers, students, game designers, instructional de\nsigners and health science experts. Using a participatory approach, the specific objectives of Phase II include the design, development and evaluation of an obesity prevention intervention in the form of an interactive web based program with four main area\ns: Science, Healthy Eating, Exercise and Family and Community. A curriculum will be developed as well as an expanded series of science modules using videogames as the centerpiece for learning while respecting the American Indian cultural and structural fra\nmework. The performance and appearance of existing modules will be enhanced as well as the entrenching of a common  artistic/emotional heart  to deliver a visually seamless story from one videogame world to the next. The team will author teacher/facilitato\nr support materials in the form of background information on videogames as educational tools, lesson plans, handouts, and assessments that aid users as they build science understandings and healthy lifestyle choices. The research goal is to research the ef\nfectiveness of an inquiry-based curriculum using a culturally congruent, web-based video game as compared to the standard science and health curriculum. Specifically, the curriculum will address nutritional content related to how eating habits and other re\nlevant behaviors affect obesity in adolescents and teenagers. Concepts surrounding digestive system structure and function as well as the role of metabolism will frame the curriculum. The development team will travel and brainstorm with the American Indian\n Tribe participants 8 times in the first year and 4 times in the second year of the project. This component is crucial in order to identify and address the felt needs of the American Indian communities and successfully weave an American Indian culturally r\nelevant thread throughout the program. Phase I Food for Thought gamers/student testers were truly engaged in game-play and after the completion of the prototypical learning module, still expressed interest in playing the games. The Phase II design team wil\nl capitalize on the interest factor and product versatility expanding the target market to home school environments and community based organizations such as Boys' and Girls Clubs and the special supplemental nutrition program for Women, Infants, and Child\nren- better known as WIC. The discussion of product versatility naturally lends itself to commercial success. If a product proves to be versatile enough to warrant appeal in diverse markets, the product should produce measurable, genuine commercial success\n. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Societal benefits of Creature Control include the intentional use of videogame technology for purposes of education. To date, few videogame developers have ventured into the educational gaming market because there is more money t\no make by creating games that strictly entertain. Many of these entertainment games boast challenging puzzles, intricate problems, and complex patterns to solve. Arguably, they are very educational. However, the content chosen rarely applies to middle and \nhigh school science concepts. In fact, many videogames receive scrutiny due to their content. This work-Creature Control-promotes the idea that appropriate and complex science concepts can be married with videogame play to create a fun and educational lear\nning experience.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance the recent discovery of an ambient temperature dehydration method \"\"Microglassification\"\" that is designed to more efficiently stabilize biomolecules for preservation. Lyophilization is the current process of choice, but it has major disadvantages including high capital cost of equipment, high energy costs, and long process time. Furthermore, with the advent of new protein therapeutics, diagnostics, vaccines, such expensive and environment-sensitive biomolecules can be irreversibly impacted due to the stresses of the freezing and the drying process and may never reach the market due to insufficient stability or even degradation that makes them antigenic and toxic in the body. Incorporation of Microglassification to produce a dry formulation of a biomolecule leads to following benefits: reduction in operation costs, production time savings, increased yield and purity, increased long-term stability, and reduced capital equipment costs.  The broader impacts of this research are not limited to broader temperature tolerances for the microglassified products facilitating storage and transport of sensitive biologics throughout the US, and also to developing countries. But also this research furthers the fundamental understanding of water removal from a protein (how molecular layers of water of hydration influence protein activity), the structural changes that might occur in the protein, and the protein interactions with its surrounding environment. It is expected that Microglassification will provide the needed stability to enable a biotechnological advance to reach the market, and, more importantly, reach the patient.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this research is to create a clinical prototype of a new optical biopsy system based on angle-resolved low coherence interferometry (a/LCI). a/LCI is a novel optical technique that uses interferometric detection of elastically scattered light to probe the nuclear morphology of esophageal epithelium. The ability of a/LCI to obtain quantitative measurements of cellular characteristics, such as nuclear size and optical density, without the need for either exogenous stains or fixatives, makes it an excellent candidate to become a screening tool for in vivo detection of pre-cancerous tissue states such as intraepithelial neoplasia. As its name implies, a/LCI detects the angular distribution of scattered light using a low-coherence interferometer. The technique enables selective detection of the optical field scattered from a small region within probed tissue by exploiting the coherence properties of broadband light. The ability to probe sub-surface cellular morphology is especially important for detecting pre- cancerous changes in epithelial tissues, where changes in the basal cell layer, approximately 100 5m beneath the surface are the most important diagnostic of tissue health. The long-range goal of this research is to create a new a/LCI-based biomedical diagnostic product for the purpose of endoscopically identifying and monitoring neoplastic transformations in humans. The research plan will create and test a clinically viable a/LCI system by achieving the following milestones: (1) conducting multi-site human clinical trials to quantitatively assess clinical utility of a/LCI for surveillance and treatment monitoring of esophageal dysplasia, (2) continuing the innovation of the Phase I hardware and probe design to optimize clinical utility of the a/LCI system and (3) developing software for tissue diagnosis based on a/LCI imaging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The objective of this research is to develop a new instrument for detecting early stage cancer in human epithelial tissues based on a novel optical spectroscopic technique, angle-resolved low coherence interferometry (a/LCI). The proposed a/LCI instrument will serve as a guide to biopsy and treatment monitoring for clinicians, enabling evaluation of tissue health in situ, prior to tissue removal. This technique has the potential to greatly improve upon the current method of random biopsy for screening and surveillance of early stage epithelial cancers.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of this SBIR project is the development of a rapid, high resolution optical method for in vivo imaging with a specific emphasis on identifying vulnerable plaque associated with cardiovascular disease. The approach uses a patent pending harmonic detection method combined with swept source optical coherence tomography for subsurface imaging of the interior walls of arteries. This method will provide important improvements over present optical coherence tomography technologies and can easily be used with fiber optics allowing coupling into endoscopes, catheters and similar devices. Harmonic detection overcomes an important disadvantage of frequency domain optical coherence tomography by achieving noise-limited removal of the complex conjugate ambiguity and other artifacts. Our approach provides better artifact rejection ratios with simpler instrumentation than other methods. With removal of these artifacts, image quality is improved, depth range is increased and the full, complex phase information is obtained. By using this harmonic detection method with swept source optical coherence tomography, the requirements for fast in vivo imaging of arterial and venous structures can be met and provide a useful method for imaging vulnerable plaque. The harmonic detection method and its benefits are applicable to frequency domain optical coherence tomography in general and can be applied to other biomedical research and medical imaging applications where optical coherence tomography has been used or is under development. In Phase II of this project, further improvements to the harmonic detection instrumentation will be made, transitioning from bench-top instrumentation using bulky, non-optimal off-the-shelf components, to a compact, commercial prototype. A currently available commercial swept source optical coherence tomography instrument will be modified to incorporate our harmonic detection technology. The applicability of this approach to biomedical imaging will be demonstrated by imaging diseased arterial segments, ex vivo and showing that our approach is competitive with time domain and other frequency domain optical coherence tomography approaches. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In vivo imaging at higher resolution than is currently achievable with ultrasound, MRI or x-ray methods is needed across several fields of medicine. Potential applications include imaging of vascular tissue including plaque deposits, guidance of biopsy needles to aid in cancer diagnosis, and guidance tools for microsurgery. The specific objective of this SBIR project is the development of a high speed, high resolution optical method for in vivo vascular imaging to aid in the identification of vulnerable plaque. Heart disease is a leading cause of death in the United States. The study of, and ultimately the detection in patients, of those plaques most likely to cause heart attacks and strokes may allow timely intervention and provide direction in developing new treatments.",

Phase I demonstrated that available trace gas infrared absorbance spectra can be converted to band model data and incorporated into standard radiative transfer models for automated calculation of atmosphere-embedded plume signatures.

Our test is intended for use prior to colposcopy by a trained healthcare professional (e.g., physician, nurse practitioner, physician's assistant) to triage women found to have an intermediate Pap result to identify those women who have high grade disease. It could also be used to triage young women in whom HPV testing is not beneficial and where HPV infection rates may be as high as 80% regardless of whether dysplasia is present. In addition to identifying high grade disease, the LightTouch device can provide enhanced imaging that could help locate the disease on the cervix for guided biopsy and for treatment. We are applying for a Bridge Award in order to complete the final work required to bring LightTouch(R) through the FDA approval process, and begin production of a commercial device which incorporates the spectroscopic based cancer diagnostic system with high-definition imaging and mapping technologies to aid the physician in image-guided therapy.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: LightTouch is a light-based, non-invasive and point-of-care technology that can be used to detect high grade cervical cancer in women. New guidelines issued by the American Society for Colposcopists and Cervical Pathologists (ASCCP) to categorize the likelihood of a woman having cancer indicate a need for new technology to detect high grade dysplasia (cancer), especially in younger women, women with positive HPV test results, and women with Pap smear results of ASC (Atypical Squamous Cells) as part of a more effective triage strategy. LightTouch can identify the actual existence of high grade dysplasia thereby shortening the time for treatment and follow-up for healthy women, increasing screening effectiveness, and pre-selecting those patients that need to be seen by a colposcopist more urgently for the treatment of dysplasia.",

An important feature of the robot?s design is that both its manipulator and its legs are driven by the same suite of six electric motors.  This intrinsic mechanical simplicity results in an extremely robust mechanism well suited for dirty, difficult jobs.  The broader impact of this research is the creation of a new class of robots designed to combat the threat posed by land mines and other explosive devices.  It is estimated that more than 60 million mines are in place throughout the world.  The Tri-Sphere robot will provide a safe, reliable means of locating, unearthing and disposing of this unexplored ordnance.  In addition, the Tri-Sphere design can be scaled to create versions of the robot tailored to the demands of mining, underwater trenching and other complex material handling operations that must be conducted in hazardous environments.",

The Phase I effort resulted in the first reported crystal ion slicing of lithium tantalate films. An ion sliced lithium tantalate film was successfully transferred to a silicon substrate. A bond process was developed to scale up the thin lithium tantalate film-on-silicon process to wafer scale. The large areas and film thickness targeted in this work will result in especially large aspect ratio detectors. The results of the Phase I effort have established the building blocks for the actual development and production in Phase II of a commercial prototype pyroelectric detector with significantly improved performance.",

Alpha particle spectroscopy is widely used in nuclear forensics to assay trace quantities of sensitive nuclear materials, but the limited spectral resolution of conventional alpha spectrometers limits their effectiveness to perform high-accuracy assays of such materials. STAR Cryoelectronics proposes to develop a high-resolution alpha spectrometer based on microcalorimeter detectors offering nearly a ten-fold improvement in energy resolution, thereby enabling the detection of minute isotopic compositional differences in sensitive nuclear materials.

Advances in human genome research have thus led to epidemiologic investigations not only of the effects of genes alone, but also of their effects in combination with environmen- tal exposures. The case-control study design, which has been widely used in classical questionnaire-based epidemiologic studies, is now commonly employed to study the role of genes and gene-environment interac- tions in the etiology of complex diseases. Recently, a broad class of semiparametric retrospective-likelihood methods has been developed for the analysis of case-control genetic data in the presence of environmental factors. These methods exploit knowledge about the distribution of genetic variants in order to build esti- mators that are much more statistically efficient than other approaches, and are also statistically valid in the presence of incomplete genetic data, such as missing marker alleles and unknown haplotypes. Because this kind of methodology is not available in any commercial software, researchers have resorted to standard approaches, which lack statistical efficiency and sometimes validity. As a result, important gene-environment interactions are obscured, as are important main effects. The goal of this project is to develop Stata software to implement the semiparametric retrospective-likelihood and related methods. The software will accom- modate missing genotypes, phase ambiguity, untyped markers, flexible disease-risk models with gene-gene and gene-environment interactions, genomewide association studies, population stratification, and models both with and without Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. This tool will be highly useful to epidemiologists and geneticists in their search for genetic and environmental determinants of complex diseases.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A Fully Automatic System For Verified Computerized Stereoanalysis SUMMARY The requirement for a trained user to interact with tissue and images is a long-standing impediment to higher throughput analysis of biological microstructures using unbiased stereology, the state-of-the-art method for accurate quantification of biological structure. Phase 1 studies addressed this limitation with Verified Computerized Stereoanalysis (VCS), an innovative approach for automatic stereological analysis that improves throughput efficiency by 6-9 fold compared to conventional computerized stereology. Work in Phase 2 integrated VCS into the Stereologer , an integrated hardware-software-microscopy system for stereological analysis of tissue sections and stored images. Validation studies of first-order stereological parameters. i.e., volume, surface area, length, number, confirmed that the color-based detection methods in the VCS approach achieve accurate results for automatic stereological analysis of high S:N biological microstructures. These studies indicate that fully automatic stereological analysis of tissue sections and stored images can be realized by elimination of two remaining barriers, which will be addressed in this Phase II Continuation Competing Renewal. In Aim 1, applications for feature extraction and microstructure classification, developed in part with funding from the Office of Naval Research, will be integrated into the VCS program. The new application (VCS II) will use these approaches to automatically detect and classify polymorphic microstructures of biological interest using a range of feature calculations, including size, color, border, shape, and texture, with support from active learning and Support Vector Machines. Work in Aim 2 will eliminate physical handling of glass slides during computerized stereology studies by equipping the Stereologer system with automatic slide loading/unloading technology controlled by the Stereologer system. This technology will approximately double the throughput efficiency of the current VCS program and support human-in-the-loop interaction for sample microstructures on the border between two or more adjacent classes. The studies in Aim 3 will rigorously test the hypothesis that fully automatic VCS can quantify first- and second-order stereological parameters, without a loss of accuracy compared to the current gold-standard - non-automatic computerized stereology, e.g., manual Stereologer. If these studies validate the accuracy of VCS II, then commercialization of the fully automatic program will facilitate the throughout efficiency for testing scientific hypotheses in a wide variety of biomedical research projects; reduce labor costs for computerized stereology studies; hasten the growth of our understanding of biological processes that underlie health, longevity, and disease; and accelerate the development of novel approaches for the therapeutic management of human disease. Solid evidence that the SRC and its strategic partners can effectively commercialize this technology is demonstrated by their worldwide sales and support of the Stereologer system for the past 13 years.

Existing semiempirical methods, while rapid, are not sufficiently accurate. The recently completed PM6 method has increased the accuracy of prediction of heats of formation of stable ground-state systems, but is still not accurate for predicting transition state energies. The proposed work would involve developing a method specifically designed for predicting activation barriers. This would involve the construction of a database of activation barriers. Existing semiempirical methods use a consistent set of parameters in predicting geometries and energies. In the new approach, Geometries would be predicted using PM6, and energies would be less elegant than conventional methods it would allow activation barriers to be predicted with much better accuracy. Construction of the database of activation barriers would involve using results of very high-level ab-initio calculations. Other groups have done calculations of this type, so this step would involve only literature research. Development of the new method involves parameter optimization only. The issues involved are now well understood, and available optimization programs should be sufficient. Finally, the new method would be integrated into existing commercial program MOPAC2009, which would be re-named MOPAC2011.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Childhood obesity has increased almost three-fold over the past several decades and diagnosis of type 2 diabetes in youth has increased thirty-fold with serious personal health and societal consequences. The purpose of this proposal is to develop and evaluate an instructional computer game called LiFESim in which students will learn scientific evidence for why healthful food and activity choices are important and then to learn ways to navigate and take action on our current food and activity environment to make health-promoting choices. The software for this proposal will be developed from the content and activities of a science education module for 5th-7th graders, Choice, Control and Change (C3) that is part of the Linking Food and the Environment (LiFE) Curriculum Series developed at Teachers College Columbia University and builds on previous modules. C3 uses a unique theoretical approach that fosters students' competence, personal agency, and self-determination related to healthful food and activity choices. The outcome evaluation of the C3 module found students who completed C3, when compared to students who had the standard science curriculum, reported improved eating and physical activity behaviors. The primary aim of the LifeSim evaluation is to determine if the LiFESim computer instructional game can have positive student outcomes, as does the C3 curriculum. The same aged students and the same outcome variables as for C3 for will be measured for the LifeSim evaluation. If LiFESim is found to be effective it will provide an alternative way for 5th-7th students to receive the C3 content that may be more flexible for teachers and engaging for students. The specific aims of this phase II proposal are to revise the LiFESim game developed in phase 1, adapt the C3 evaluation instruments and methods to make them appropriate for evaluating the LiFESim game, and formatively and summatively evaluate the LiFESim game in 5th-7th grade classrooms in New York City Schools. We initially plan to commercialize this software by packaging it with the LiFE curriculum. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The principal benefit that we hope to achieve in LifeSim is to influence changes in eating and physical activity behaviors of the students using LifeSim to aid in the prevention of childhood obesity. We are looking at influencing the following specific behaviors and their influences:1) eat more fruit and vegetables; 2) drink fewer sweetened beverages and more water; 3) eat less frequently at fast food establishments; 4) eat fewer prepackaged snacks; 5) increase moderate and vigorous physical activity; and 6) decrease recreational screen-time.

In Phase I, SureGene demonstrated the feasibility of using specific dimensions of mental illness to discover novel genes and genetic variants that influence risk and impact the clinical presentation of these diseases. This project will build on first-generation genetic biomarkers in the form of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and chromosomally-related associations of these polymorphisms called haplotypes. The Phase II project will further develop biomarkers for neuropsychiatric illnesses using a set of genes that meet stringent criteria for genetic replication. The project will develop products for research and clinical applications that combine biomarkers in these genes. The aims are 1) Develop a prototype AssureGeneTM array and data set for schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. SureGene will develop a flexible SNP genotyping product incorporating a high density of SNPs in approximately 200 genes and generate a detailed data set relating genotypes to phenotypes based on 2000 NIMH schizophrenia, bipolar, and control samples. A first-generation array and data set will be made available to the research community by the middle of Grant Year 2. A refined array and data set for prospective clinical applications will be completed by the end of Phase II. 2) Evaluate the utility of the AssureGeneTM test for differential diagnosis and for predicting progression to clinically defined psychosis. SureGene will develop genetic algorithms for the array for use in predicting dichotomous clinical outcomes. This Aim should provide a collective set of predictive models that can be evaluated on the basis of their sensitivity, specificity, and overall classification accuracy. 3) Develop and implement a flexible medical resequencing platform (ExonReadTM) for high priority genes. SureGene will develop a cost-effective  next generation  medical resequencing platform that can be used by the research community to evaluate the contribution of rare or spontaneous mutations in key genes contributing to psychopathology and clinical outcomes for neuropsychiatric illnesses. A prototype sequencing platform for research use will be completed in Grant Year 2. SureGene will apply ExonReadTM to a sample of African Americans and Caucasians with a family history of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder to establish baseline expectations and limitations of the product. The commercial potential for these products is significant. By targeting common variants, the AssureGeneTM array should have broad applicability in research and clinical settings, with both diagnostic and pharmacogenetic applications.

PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The long term objective of this project is to develop validated gene-related tests (genetic biomarkers) to aid in more accurate diagnosis and customized treatment of schizophrenia and related  schizophrenia spectrum  disorders, including bipolar disorder. SureGene's goals for this research are to refine existing genetic biomarkers and to discover and refine additional novel genetic biomarkers. Products based on these biomarkers should be helpful to individuals suffering from schizophrenia and related disorders, their families and health care providers, and researchers seeking to improve diagnosis and treatment.",

        "abstract": "Artificial lighting consumes about 20 percent of U.S. energy production and has rather low efficiencies:   from 7 percent for incandescent lamps to about 30 percent for the most efficient, but high cost, discharge and compact fluorescent lamps.  This project will develop an economical incandescent lamp, based on an innovative selective emitter technology, with a high energy efficiency.  Phase I analytically demonstrated feasibility of the selective-emitter-based energy efficient incandescent lamp, demonstrated the fabrication process for the key emitter element, and proved that the emitter could performe for several hours without filament burn-out.  Phase II will optimize the designs, materials, and processes used in Phase I, demonstrate the technical goals (efficiency, life, cost) of the lamp through fabrication and testing, and demonstrate repeatability in performance and life.  Phase II lamps are targeted to have twice the efficiency of current incandescent lamps, 2000 hr life, and a cost comparable to standard incandescent lamps.Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  This technology should be applicable to many types of incandescent lamps for energy efficiency and conservation.  Similar applications exist in industrial applications such as paper drying and photovoltaic systems (for energy generation).  An economical incandescent lamp with a high energy efficiency would have a annual market exceeding $1 billion per year.  After successful development and implementation, such efficient lamps would produce energy savings of 3-5 percent",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop the underlying technology behind a highly efficient energy storage system that can provide reliable, dispatchable power from intermittent renewable energy sources such as wind and solar.   This technology is based on a novel hydrogen/chlorine chemistry embodied in a regenerative fuel cell architecture that can address MW-scale applications.  This project will develop a better scientific understanding of important technological barriers to commercial implementation of this technology including developing an insight into parametric behavior through both experimentation and modeling, improving reactant mass transport at the chlorine electrode, and eliminating parasitic shunt currents in multi-cell module architectures. Sustainable Innovations, LLC, will work with Harvard University to develop an  8-cell, laboratory scale electrochemical module having a round-trip efficiency of over 80%  with design features that optimize mass transport and reduce shunt currents and will evaluate the performance of this module through a series of parametric and durability tests.  This research will culminate in the development and demonstration of a 100-Watt integrated system and the development of a 135 kW system concept that will serve as a critical building block for future commercialization efforts.  Concern about the increasing level of greenhouse gases is intensifying the global interest in better ways to harness renewables such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power.   Renewable power applications have experienced significant growth as a result of this belief and also technological advancements that have\nreduced their cost and increased their efficiency.  Utility privatization and deregulation have opened the market for innovative power technologies, and some consumers have elected to use renewables even when they are more expensive than grid power.  But renewables can't always generate power on demand because they depend upon favorable natural conditions, such as the presence of sunlight or wind.  The development of cost effective, efficient energy storage systems that could create dispatchable power from inherently intermittent renewables may enable the widespread use of these technologies.  Various technologies, particularly batteries, have been implemented for applications requiring energy storage,  but conventional batteries have significant efficiency, cycle life and life cycle cost limitations which reduce the overall cost effectiveness of renewable installations.  New technologies, such as hydrogen/halogen regenerative fuel cells with improved efficiency, cycle life and cost are needed to add value and utility to intermittent renewables creating technical and economic drivers for widespread commercial deployment and global electrification.",

This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop and evaluate a Beta prototype 50 kW 300 kW-hr novel energy storage system. No current energy storage technology can provide low specific cost, high energy density, and long lifetime operation in the mid-capacity range (100kWh - 10 MWh). Particular opportunities exist with renewable energy providers (e.g., wind and solar), commercial & industrial consumers, as well as utilities for services such as capacity firming, consumption smoothing, energy arbitrage, and power regulation. SustainX intends to develop, manufacture and market a disruptive, cost-effective and scalable energy storage device that will serve as an enabling technology for the proliferation of alternative energy generation sources, such as wind and solar power. Having demonstrated technical feasibility through the Phase 1 & 1B effort, the company's Phase II effort will be dedicated to improving system round-trip efficiency, scaling the technology, and ultimately deploying a Beta system at a customer site.  Low cost, long lifetime energy storage has the potential to broadly impact grid stability and reliability, commercial and industrial consumer energy costs, and renewable energy generator value and overall market penetration.  As the penetration of wind increases due to renewable portfolio standards, rising fossil fuel costs, public sentiment surrounding climate change\nand other market pressures, the industry faces a number of challenges. These include, but are not limited to, intermittency of supply, errors in forecasting power production, increased regulation requirements, and transmission congestion. As wind becomes a larger percentage of the energy portfolio, these challenges are compounded. Energy storage has the potential to mitigate these integration issues, thereby allowing wind power to be utilized on a larger scale in a more economically-viable fashion. Specifically, wind generators will be able to use SustainX's energy storage technology to firm capacity, increase peak sales, and enhance ancillary service capabilities. Storage capacity therefore not only represents a significant value to current wind production, but should also be seen as an enabling technology that will allow the world to reach its near- and long-term energy management goals.",

        "abstract": "The threat of nuclear proliferation remains a critical issue.  There is no greater indicator of the capability and intent of a nation than observation of actual detonation tests being conducted.  Ground-based monitoring systems have proven to be very capable in identifying nuclear tests, and can provide somewhat precise information on the location and yield of the explosive device.  However, these measurements currently require very expensive and bulky seismometers that are difficult to deploy in places where they are most needed.  A high performance, compact device would enable the rapid deployment of large scale arrays, which, in turn, could be used to provide higher quality data during times of critical need.  This project will develop a low-cost, small sensor that can achieve the required sensor self-noise of 0.5 ng/Hz1/2, with a total dynamic range of more than 150 dB.  This will be accomplished in a form factor of approximately 1 cm3, with power consumption below 30 mW.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  In addition to the nonproliferation application, these sensors should greatly enhance our understanding of the earth and provide early-warning systems for earthquakes and tsunami.  These sensors also should find extensive use in oil and gas exploration.  They will be 100 times smaller than any existing devices, and consume 1/10th the power, making it easy to deploy anywhere in the world.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The risk of explosions in underground mines due to the presence of combustible gases is severe. The overall long-term objective of the proposed project is to develop and commercialize a new generation of affordable, rel\niable and portable hazardous gas detector in a Smart Gas Card format for use as a personal safety tool. The development of such an easy to use and wear personal monitor for the detection of combustible gases (e.g. methane) would be a substantial benefit to\n worker health and safety. In Phase I Synkera successfully demonstrated the feasibility of the critical element of such monitor, namely a low power, high performance reliable gas microsensor for detection of combustible gases. Now the objective of the Phas\ne II effort is to advance the sensor technology to the maturity level required for portable detectors and to develop prototypes of Smart Combustible Gas Cardj. It will also facilitate the development of a Smart Multigas Card (methane, oxygen and carbon mon\noxide) required for each group of underground miners and for each miner who works alone. Portable combustible gas detectors on the market today typically catalytic bead sensors, or in the case of permanent installations, also infrared (IR) sensor technolog\ny. These are not suitable for personal monitoring due either bulk and cost (IR) or high power consumption (catalytic bead). Additionally, the stability and reliability of existing combustible gas sensors must be improved in order to enable fail-safe operat\nion. Proposed new and improved catalytic combustible gas microsensors are based on a new microsensor platform technology, integrating precision-engineered nanostructured sensing elements with high surface area into a robust monolithic ceramic platform. In \norder to achieve the project objectives, in Phase II Synkera will (1) complete the sensor development and realize targeted performance; (2) develop and validate application-specific sensors, (3) identify and validate scale-up approaches, (3) develop low po\nwer electronics for portable Smart Card monitors, (4) fabricate Smart Combustible Gas Cardj prototypes and (5) develop partnerships for commercialization of microsensors and Smart Gas Card products. The proposed project is an opportunity to develop highly \ncompetitive products that address industry needs for personal safety tools, eliminate current cost and performance barriers, and provide a substantial benefit to worker health and safety, empowering individuals to make life-saving decisions in hazardous co\nnditions as well during and in the aftermath of accidents. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The mining industry is one of the more challenging occupational sectors that involve adverse workers conditions, including the presence of hazardous and combustible gases. \nCurrent gas monitoring is accomplished via both fixed systems and portable instruments; however, the size and cost of current portable instruments has been a barrier to their use by all mining employees. Proposed sensor will support a new type of dramatica\nlly improved and inexpensive portable combustible gas monitors for individual use, thus enabling a new approach to alleviating intrinsic hazards of this occupation.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Between 10 and 28 percent of Americans suffer from chronic low back pain (CLBP). Chronic pain self-management programs that include behavioral and cognitive-behavioral therapies (CBT) have been demonstrated as effective in improving pain, function, and quality of life. These techniques are endorsed as an important component of a comprehensive pain management approach by several national organizations, including the American Pain Society and the Joint Commission for the Accreditation of Health Care Organizations. Since access to CBT for chronic pain is limited, there is a tremendous need for safe, effective, low-cost self- management programs for individuals suffering from CLBP. Toward this end, this project developed an interactive online intervention, the Wellness Workbook (WW). In Phase I research, a pilot version of the WW was developed and customized for individuals with CLBP. The WW is an interactive web-based intervention consisting of a mind/body treatment rationale, pain education, and instruction in cognitive-behavioral pain management techniques. The efficacy of the Phase I WW was evaluated in a randomized, waitlist-controlled trial with 118 individuals with CLBP. Results indicated that those who used the Phase I version of the WW for 3 weeks endorsed more adaptive beliefs regarding pain control and showed improvements in self-efficacy, mood regulation, helplessness, and fearful avoidance of physical activity. Phase II will consist of further development and piloting of the WW and supplemental tools such as a moderated discussion board and a physical activity planning tool. Efficacy of the final WW intervention will be evaluated in an RCT with 198 CLBP patients recruited over the internet. Intervention group participants will use the WW intervention for 10 weeks and control group participants will be given print materials. Both groups will be receive bi-weekly telephone check- ins. Outcome variables will include pain-related disability, pain interference, disabling attitudes and beliefs, mood and physical activity levels. Assessments will be given at base-line, post- intervention (10 weeks) and at 8 weeks follow-up. The WW will be marketed through primary care and specialty clinics and will be available at low cost to individual patients. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Chronic lower back pain is one of the most widely experienced health problems in the United States, is a leading cause of disability and has an estimated cost of  30 to  70 billion yearly. Cognitive and behavioral approaches (CBT) are established, empirically supported treatments that improve quality of life, functioning and reduce pain-related disability for chronic pain patients. The present project will develop a web-based CBT intervention for chronic low back pain which will be effective, convenient, private and available for low cost to patients regardless of location or insurance coverage.",

During the Phase II project the tool be expanded to include ongoing support and training for all school-based middle school drug prevention programs on the SAMHSA model program list (NREPP). The specific aims of the Phase II study are to: (1) Create a detailed matrix for all middle school drug prevention programs that identifies common content and methods across programs; (2) Develop multimedia messages for each content and method used in NREPP programs; (3) Develop an efficient and effective system for distributing messages; and (4) Complete a field trial to compare the fidelity of implementation for teachers using the system with teachers who are not using the online system. There are 12 middle school programs currently on the NREPP list, although we expect their will be additional programs on the list by the time this project begins. We will complete development of the website which will send teachers emails that invite them to register and schedule classes on the website. Prior to upcoming sessions of the program they are teaching, teachers will receive emails. For each middle school program on the NREPP list we will develop up to 20 brief email messages (less than 100 words) that provide links to streaming video with teacher testimonials or classroom demonstrations about upcoming session content or methods. With the assistance of state prevention coordinators in Virginia and Illinois, we will recruit 200 middle school teachers to participate in this research.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Site-targeted microbubbles (MB) have demonstrated potential as a molecular imaging tool. A new targeted MB platform was developed in phase I of this project. This MB enables covalent coupling of targeting ligands using thioether conjugation chemistry. MB bearing a novel single-chain VEGF (scVEGF) targeting ligand was synthesized. The scVEGF MB bind with high specificity to endothelial VEGF receptors, and do not activate VEGFR signaling. These agents have application as a molecular imaging probe in a research setting, and have potential for translation to clinical use. We now seek to validate this agent as a research tool for molecular ultrasound imaging in drug discovery and basic science, and to investigate a potential clinical use. We hypothesize that scVEGF MB can detect angiogenesis in the context of tumor growth with greater sensitivity and specificity than non-targeted MB, B-mode ultrasound alone, or optical imaging probes. Specifically, we will evaluate the relationship between targeted microbubble concentration and quantified acoustic signal in vitro and in vivo, examine the ability of scVEGF MB to detect angiogenic tumors in several mouse models of cancer, and investigate the ability of these agents monitor response to therapy. Additionally, we will explore the potential utility of scVEGF MB in the context of prostate cancer biopsy guidance. The relationship between acoustic signal and targeted microbubble concentration will first be analyzed in vitro with an ultrasound flow phantom using a novel real-time ultrasound contrast quantification scheme. The sensitivity and specificity of scVEGF MB for angiogenic tumor vasculature will be examined in a bioluminescent mouse model of cancer, and validated by immunohistochemistry and bioluminescence imaging. The utility of scVEGF MB as a tool for monitoring response to therapy will be examined in a mouse model of prostate cancer. The change in tumor volume over several weeks of treatment will be evaluated using calipers, and correlated to the quantified scVEGF MB signal. Additionally, the sensitivity of scVEGF MB for monitoring treatment response will be compared against non-targeted MB (which quantify tumor blood flow) and a near-infrared VEGFR2 optical imaging contrast agent. Prostate biopsy guidance is a potential clinical application for the scVEGF MB, and we will evaluate feasibility for this in a canine model of the disease. Prostate biopsy of canines referred to a veterinary imaging center will be performed under standard B-mode ultrasound or scVEGF MB guidance, and the ability of scVEGF MB guidance to enhance prostate cancer detection will be examined. We anticipate that this project will enable determination of whether scVEGF MB can 1) specifically image angiogenic tumors, 2) monitor the response to experimental anti-cancer therapies in relevant preclinical models, and 3) increase the sensitivity of biopsy guidance in a clinical setting. These studies will enable validation of scVEGF microbubbles as a product for detecting and monitoring tumor development in a preclinical research and drug discovery setting, and evaluate the potential for this technology in a clinical setting. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Probes able to detect molecular components of cancer have the potential to accelerate drug discovery, enhance basic research, and improve the sensitivity of cancer detection in a clinical setting. Ultrasound imaging is widely used in both research and clinical applications, and provides a cost-effective, real-time imaging technique that does not require ionizing radiation. The tumor-targeted agent proposed here will enable the use of ultrasound imaging for molecular imaging of cancer with greater sensitivity and safety than existing technology.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Technological Assistance Institute for Intellectual Disability, Inc. proposes to develop a product line of public health and emergency preparedness education programs to meet the needs of people with disabilities, and the institutions and organizations that serve them. The Live Smart Live Safe (LSLS) programs will address material, behavioral, and emotional preparedness for public health, natural, and man-made disasters. The final result of this work will be the LSLS programs, consisting of CD-ROM, DVD, and pictorial-based  911 Notebook  (911 Notes), designed for the unique learning needs of people with Intellectual Disabilities (ID). The programs will be disseminated through public health and social service, public and private education institutions, and advocacy and support service agencies and families that assist youth and adults with disabilities as they move toward full inclusion and independence in communities across the Nation. Given the National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR) focus on biological and behavioral aspects of critical health problems that confront the Nation, this application addresses NINR priorities including a) improving health-related quality of life by preventing or delaying disease, b) establishing better approaches to promote health and prevent disease, b) promote interventions to eliminate health disparities, and c) to develop technologies to assist individuals in reducing environmental exposures (e.g., chemical and viral agents). Phase II of this application will expand the Phase I prototype program, and develop and evaluate the remaining three interactive CD-ROM computer-based training programs that address public health emergencies, natural, and man-made disasters including terrorism. Along with the CD-ROM programs, four companion DVD programs will be developed as well as a pictorial-based 911 Notes to accompany and support information conveyed via CD-ROM. We will work with one advisory panel of people with ID and conduct 30 telephone interviews with experts in the areas of public health and emergency preparedness to shape content and message presentation. We will evaluate the Phase II programs with 80 individuals with mild ID throughout the State of Oregon employing a pretest, posttest, and follow-up evaluation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Most Americans rely on television, written materials, and the Internet to learn about, and prepare for potential emergency situations. Although people with Intellectual Disabilities (ID) such as mild, or moderate mental retardation often watch television, most written materials, guidelines, and web-based resources that provide information about public health, natural, and man-made disasters rely heavily on text, and are inaccessible to people with mild or moderate ID. People with ID, many of whom are independent and live on their own do not have access to this potentially life-saving information.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Influenza virus-like particles (VLPs) have demonstrated in preclinical studies that they are highly immunogenic and efficacious in protecting against influenza infections. This emerging vaccine technology not only creates new vaccine candidates with alternative routes of administration (intranasal or intramuscular) but also implements a fast, flexible, and dependable cell-based manufacturing system that overcomes many of the burdens associated with the current egg production system. VLPs are structures that morphologically and biochemically mimic a wild type influenza virus, however they lack viral genetic material and are unable to replicate and cause infection; therefore chemical inactivation is not required. This better maintains the native conformation of the antigenic epitopes in the VLP vaccine. The safety of the technology allows for the development of vaccines directed against highly pathogenic influenza virus strains without the risk of disseminating infectious material. The Phase I SBIR award allowed us to create and test in preclinical studies several VLP vaccine candidates designed to protect against highly pathogenic pandemic strains of the influenza virus such as H1N1-1918; H5N1 and H7N7 avian influenza viruses. These studies have shown that VLP vaccines are immunogenic and efficacious, further proving the value of the VLP technology for influenza vaccine development. In the current application, we propose to further advance the development of these vaccine products with additional preclinical studies. We will develop a purification system for large scale manufacturing of VLP vaccines, prior to cGMP manufacturing. We will perform one comparative pilot study between a VLP vaccine produced in the insect cell/baculovirus system and the same VLP vaccine produced in stably transfected recombinant mammalian cells. Further, we aim to perform small scale cGMP vaccine production and toxicology studies for a Pre-Innovation Drug Application (IND) with the FDA. The specific aims of the Phase II SBIR are: A) To produce, characterize, and test in preclinical studies in mice the influenza-virus-like particle (VLP) vaccines designed to protect against 1) H5N1 avian influenza virus, 2) human H1N1-1918 influenza virus and 3) H7N7 avian influenza, and to perform cross protection and enhancement of immunogenicity (including in the elderly) studies as well as to develop a large scale purification method and to compare the immunogenicity of the H5N1 VLP vaccine produced in the insect cell/ baculovirus system and the same vaccine produced in a recently developed stably transformed mammalian which could be developed as a second generation VLP manufacturing system. B) To evaluate vaccine efficacy, dosage and adjuvant formulations for enhancement of vaccine potency and antigen sparing in preclinical studies in ferrets. C) Perform small scale cGMP vaccine production and toxicology studies for a Pre-Innovation Drug Application (IND) with the FDA. Completion of this SBIR Phase II will bring the VLP vaccine technology to the point of a Phase I clinical trial in humans and will advance this new vaccine product and manufacturing system towards commercialization. Although pandemic influenza VLP vaccines are being developed during this project, the outcome will validate the robustness of the technology for development of seasonal influenza vaccine which currently is burdened with prolonged production times, dependence on chicken eggs, insufficient yield with certain strains, inflexibility for accommodating newly emerging variants, and unsuitability when working with highly virulent virus, all issues where the VLP technology is superior. This SBIR Phase II will accelerate the creation of vital prophylactic vaccines (e.g. H5, H7 avian flu and 1918) and will also validate a faster, more flexible, cell-based technology for epidemic influenza vaccine production. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Influenza is a recurrent respiratory infection afflicting humans all over the world. The virus changes constantly generating new epidemic and pandemic viruses, for which vaccines are needed. Although prophylactic vaccines for epidemic strains are available, periodic updates are required to maintain protective efficacy. Vaccines for pandemic viruses are lacking and their development is critical. Here we proposed to further develop the influenza virus-like particle (VLP) technology for the generation of pandemic and epidemic influenza vaccines. This technology is fast, flexible, and reliable for creating highly effective vaccines which are manufactured in a cell-based system. The VLP vaccines system overcomes many of the problems of the egg production system. Successful development of these vaccines will benefit society globally.",

For this software to become a productive tool, a user-friendly interface will be needed to facilitate the configuration of components, to set up integrated simulations, and to perform simulation analyses.  This project will develop a schema-based environment for configuring, analyzing, and documenting (SECAD) integrated fusion simulations.  The SECAD system will be a user-friendly environment for setting up integrated fusion simulations and their analyses, for performing visualization, and for improving performance.  Phase I developed a prototype SECAD capable of editing partial configuration files and running parameter studies for simulations.  In Phase II, the SECAD system will be fully developed and will consist of (1) infrastructure for integrating the software with an analysis tool; (2) a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that will allow users to edit and validate software inputs, visualize their simulation data, set up parameter studies, and visualize the output; and (3) performance enhancements for components developed for a variety of platforms. Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  In addition to fusion projects, the SECAD system should be applicable to many scientific and industrial efforts including the upcoming Fusion Simulation Project, Integrated Tokamak Modeling for ITER, Earth Science Modeling Framework, Global Nuclear Energy Partnership, climate modeling, automotive and aerospace engineering, and other projects that need to integrate multiple software components.",

        "abstract": "Hundreds of millions of dollars have been committed toward the study of complex natural phenomena on today\u00c2\u00bfs massively parallel computers.  Access to such computing power is enabling scientists to employ highly-accurate high-order finite element methods to solve previously intractable problems.  However, these high-order finite element methods present new challenges to existing solution methods, because of fundamental differences in corresponding matrices and the need for higher memory consumption.  This project will investigate the use of algebraic multi-grid preconditioners generated from sparser matrices as a cheaper alternative to the algebraic multi-grid preconditioners generated from high-order finite element matrices.  Phase I compared the two algebraic multi-grid approaches:  (1) the original high-order finite element matrix, and (2) a sparser matrix equivalent to using tri-linear finite elements on a mesh of equivalent order.  It was demonstrated that the sparser approaches yield faster simulation times and reduced memory costs for most problems of interest.  In Phase II, new capabilities will be added to two codes (HYPRE and PETSc), enabling users to construct a sparse approximation of a dense matrix generated from high-order finite element discretizations.  This matrix will be used to construct cheaper algebraic multigrid-based preconditioners that still will enable fast simu\u00c2\u00adlations with nearly optimal convergence behavior. Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  DOE projects employing high-order finite elements should gain greater efficiency in their simulations on today\u00c2\u00bfs supercomputers when using these preconditioners.  In addition, the new computational approach should generate consulting opportunities to assist users in optimally employing these preconditioners in their code",

        "abstract": "The future electron-ion collider will have an ion luminosity that is orders-of-magnitude higher than current systems.  This high luminosity will require cooling of the ion beam.  An exciting concept known as \u00c2\u00bfcoherent\u00c2\u00bf electron cooling (CEC) combines the best features of electron cooling and stochastic cooling, to enable the cooling of >250 GeV proton bunches and other high-energy hadron beams with order-of-magnitude shorter cooling times.  However, the CEC concept is unproven and requires detailed simulation of its key components.  This project will develop a code suite for the design of future CEC systems.  The challenge is to accurately characterize the effective velocity drag on an ion, as a function of its initial velocity.  Phase I demonstrated the correct simulation of a single ion in the \u00c2\u00bfmodulator\u00c2\u00bf of a CEC section, in which ions imprint a signature (i.e., wake) on the electron density and velocities.  Phase II will involve characterizing the effective velocity drag on an ion.  Possible mechanisms for reducing the velocity drag \u00c2\u00bf  including shot noise, overlapping wakes due to the presence of many ions, boundary effects in a finite-sized electron beam, and transverse ion dynamics between the modulator and the kicker \u00c2\u00bf will be explored.

For example, electromagnetic modeling of RF sources, waveguides, couplers, and cavities is handled by one piece of software, while heat load analysis of the same components is handled by completely different software.  The use of separate software tools for modeling the same hardware has a number of disadvantages:  (1) duplicative efforts in terms of specifying the same hardware in different software packages, (2) difficulties in moving data from one package to another, and (3) reduced overall speed of the design cycle.  This project will extend a leading electromagnetic particle simulation code, VORPAL, by adding a thermal and temperature analysis capability.  In Phase I, a prototype thermal analysis capability was demonstrated and benchmarked in one and two dimensions, a new capability to treat non-linear material properties was added, and various boundary treatments were demonstrated.  In Phase II, the thermal analysis capability will be realized for arbitrarily complicated geometries, the user interface will be refined to improve usability, and the computational algorithms will be optimized to assure fast and effective operation of the software.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In psychiatry, perhaps more than in any other field of medicine, diagnosis depends on clinical judgment, as there exist few physiological markers of specific psychiatric illnesses. Structured interview methods, such as the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR (SCID), yield more accurate and reliable diagnostic judgments than do the type of unstructured patient interviews that predominate in clinical settings. The SCID, however, remains an unattractive option to most clinicians, in part because it is a lengthy and complex paper-and-pencil instrument that requires extensive training to learn to administer it correctly. Additionally, the paper SCID is costly and cumbersome to reproduce and store. Computer-assisted SCID administration can alleviate both the difficulty of administering the SCID, as well as its high cost per administration. The objective of the proposed project, therefore, is to develop a computer-assisted version of the SCID ( Net SCID ) that will facilitate more widespread adoption of this gold-standard diagnostic instrument by making the SCID easier and less expensive to use. During Phase I of the project, we used archival and simulated SCID data to develop a database-driven, Internet-based functioning prototype that automates the complex branching and diagnostic logic of the paper-based SCID. In Phase II, we will 1) develop a commercial-quality user interface and diagnostic reporting tool for the Net SCID; 2) conduct side-by-side comparisons of the paper and Net SCIDs with live patient responses to establish the usability of the Net SCID for live interviewing, and assure that the Net SCID produces the same diagnoses in response to live responses as does the existing paper SCID; and 3) compare the performance of the Net SCID to that of the paper SCID with respect to interview duration, ease of administration, and user satisfaction. In addition, we will implement and test computer-assisted versions of variations of the SCID (including the Clinician Version) and make several improvements to the Net SCID that will enhance its commercial viability, such as providing an online help feature and the ability to store HIPAA- compliant databases of item responses and diagnoses for statistical analysis.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Estimates of antenatal and postpartum depression vary from 7 percent to upwards of 30 percent depending on criteria for depression, the type of assessment used, and the timing of the assessment. Thus, approximately 320,000 to over 1 million women each year experience symptoms of perinatal depression. Estimates of antenatal depression are harder to obtain because of the lack of appropriate diagnostic criteria. Despite this, no screener currently exists that has been developed and tested with both antenatal and postpartum women that uses concise, simple language, and a consistent response option set. The overall aim of this project is to develop a brief screener to assess depressive symptoms among antenatal and postpartum women. The proposed screener will be easier for patients to understand, will take less time, and will be more psychometrically sound than current screeners. In Phase I we will develop approximately 30 items that are specific to depression in antenatal and postpartum women. We will test these items using cognitive interviewing among a sample of 10 antenatal and 10 postpartum women in addition to 32 general depression items we have previously developed. Experts will review the results of the cognitive interviewing to develop the item pool that will be tested in Phase II. The Phase II item pool will consist of at least 20 general depression items, 10 items specific to antenatal women, and 10 items specific to postpartum women. In Phase II, 500 antenatal and 500 postpartum women (70 percent from private sector sites and 30 percent from public sector sites) will complete the EPDS (as a screener into the study), BDI-II, the PROMIS depression items, our items, and the depression module of the SCID. IRT analyses will be conducted on these data to develop a 7-9 item screener. We anticipate that approximately 5-7 of these items will be applicable to both antenatal and postpartum women and approximately 2-3 of these items will be sample specific. The developed screener will then be given to 400 women who will take the survey twice, approximately 4-7 days apart. Conclusions regarding test-retest reliability and patient satisfaction with taking the screener using different modes of technologies will be made from this study.",

As noted in a 2003 Institute of Medicine (IOM) report, far too few psychiatry residents are choosing clinical research careers. The same is true of graduate level trainees in psychology, nursing, and social work. This negative trend bodes ill for the nation, as efforts to develop more effective prevention and treatment strategies for drug abuse and other mental illnesses will be seriously hindered in years to come. To address the shortage of curricula that increase research competency for graduate students from mental health-related disciplines, the aim of this SBIR Fast-Track product development application is to create an engaging, facilitated, multimedia 2-semester course that will teach psychiatry residents and graduate-level psychology, nursing, and social work trainees the basic concepts needed to understand the scientific and practical aspects of clinical drug abuse research. Entitled Getting Started in Drug Abuse Research: A Multidisciplinary Introduction, the proposed course will fill a void in research training curricula and provide encouragement to students who might be well-suited for such a career. Phase I of this SBIR project will demonstrate feasibility and provide proof of concept by developing a comprehensive Course Outline for the entire 10-module course and producing a single web-based prototype module that includes self-assessment exercises, and a printable Instructor Guide and Student Materials. During Phase II, the remaining 9 modules will be fully developed and rigorously assessed, video introductions to all 10 modules will be produced, and all course materials will be incorporated into a sophisticated e-learning platform for storage and retrieval by instructors and students. Both qualitative and objective, quantifiable assessments will demonstrate enduring gains in knowledge and changes in attitudes. Notable features of the course include course content that is carefully evaluated by expert consultants from varied disciplines, an engaging documentary-style video component, use of a customized e-learning platform, a second-semester course module in which students are mentored as they design and conduct their own modest drug abuse research studies, and a solid commitment to ensuring that the needs of a diverse student audience are met. The proposed 10-module course will fill an important niche in the health care education market in a technologically innovative way, and will contribute to NIDA's mission of increasing drug abuse-related scientific literacy among graduate-level students from diverse health care disciplines.",

        "abstract": "Genetically engineered proteins are now being used in a wide range of critically important applications, including bioremediation, alternative energy production, and the treatment and prevention of human and animal disease.  However, current manufacturing platforms are limited to a small number of cell-based systems that rely on bacteria, fungi, and insect and mammalian tissue culture cells.  While adequate for the production of soluble proteins, these platforms often fall short of the large-scale manufacturing processes that are needed to produce the membrane and secretory proteins that are now under scrutiny by the energy and pharmaceutical industries.  This project will develop a novel platform technology \u00c2\u00bf based on a common pond-water ciliate, Tetrahymena thermophila \u00c2\u00bf that is ideally suited to the rapid, low-cost production of such difficult-to-express proteins.  Phase I demonstrated the utility of this approach for overproduction and rapid purification of a flu vaccine antigen, which served as a model membrane/secretory protein.  Phase II will apply this technology to the production of enzymes being developed for biofuel manufacture.  In addition, Tetrahymena\u00c2\u00bfs vast membrane system will be exploited to overproduce a G-protein-coupled receptor; then, it will be demonstrated that the receptor can be labeled with stable isotopes for structure-based studies with NMR. Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The new platform technology should have direct application to vaccine development, therapeutic protein manufacture, rational drug design, and industrial processes, including alternative energy production.

This Phase II research will be based on the Phase I results which identified the technical, logistical and professional development challenges that influence the rapid calculation, aggregation and real-time, online, reporting of problem solving assessment data to diverse educational stakeholders. The research will first design and implement an Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) model for data analysis and reporting and incorporate these designs into a system scale-up plan to flexibly accommodate the 10-20 fold increase in users indicated by our commercialization plan. A central component of this development will be a data warehouse that will be instrumented allowing the analysis of how teachers access the performance data, which will be linked to a digital dashboard which will provide teachers with an easy, and highly visual access to multi-dimensional assessments of their\nstudents and comparison classrooms. Additionally, this information will be used to develop new forms of professional development to support teachers in the better use of the data available.  The impact of this extensible formative, summative and programmatic assessment system of learning will have broad relevance for helping teachers to teach, students to learn, and administrators to make informed data-driven decisions through the continual, and real-time formative evaluation of a student's problem solving progress, a dimension not frequently or rigorously assessed in today's classrooms, yet a critical component of 21st century skills. The outcomes of this project should have widespread utility at all levels of science education and should allow cumulative comparisons of problem solving across science domains, classrooms, teachers and school systems thus helping to re-think the ways scientific problem solving is systemically assessed and how the impact of teaching these skills becomes quantified.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This SBIR Phase I/Phase II Fast-Track proposal is intended to develop a novel therapy for patients with sepsis and septic shock. Septic shock is the leading cause of death in non-cardiac intensive care units. Despite advances in the management of trauma victims, the incidence of sepsis and septic shock has increased significantly. More than 750,000 patients develop sepsis and septic shock each year with an overall mortality rate of 28.6% in the US alone. The global market potential for sepsis treatment is estimated at over  30 billion annually. Thus, successful development of a novel and effective anti-sepsis therapy will not only have a positive impact on health care, but will also have significant commercial benefits. Although apoptosis plays an important role in the pathobiology of sepsis, the clearance of apoptotic cells has largely been ignored. Recent evidence shows that the opsonizing protein milk fat globule epidermal growth factor-factor VIII (MFG-E8) is involved in apoptotic cell clearance. We have discovered that downregulation of MFG-E8 is responsible for the reduced apoptotic cell clearance in sepsis. Early administration of rat MFG-E8-containing exosomes or recombinant murine MFG-E8 (rmMFG- E8) increases phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, reduces proinflammatory cytokines, and improves survival in a rodent model of septic shock. However, one obstacle hampering the development of MFG-E8 as a therapeutic agent for septic patients is the potential immunogenicity of animal proteins in humans. To overcome this, we have successfully expressed recombinant human MFG-E8 (rhMFG-E8). Our data strongly suggest that rhMFG-E8 is as effective as animal MFG-E8. We therefore hypothesize that administration of rhMFG-E8, even late after the onset of sepsis, improves cardiovascular function, attenuates tissue injury and inflammation, and reduces mortality. The primary goal of this SBIR Fast-Track project is targeted toward completing the preclinical development of rhMFG-E8 as a novel therapeutic agent in reducing mortality in septic shock. In the Phase I Segment, we will 1) scale up the production of rhMFG- E8; and 2) further confirm the beneficial effect of rhMFG-E8 in a rodent model of septic shock. These readily achievable milestones should provide useful feasibility information that will allow us to conduct the proposed Phase II experiments. In the Phase II Segment, we will 3) determine the dose-response effect and time-course (delayed administration) of rhMFG-E8 on apoptosis, cardiovascular responses, tissue injury, inflammation, and survival in a rodent model of septic shock; 4) assess the toxicity and pharmacokinetic properties of rhMFG-E8 in normal and septic animals; and 5) determine the efficacy of rhMFG-E8 in a swine model of septic shock. These proposed studies should provide useful preclinical information that will allow us to file an IND application to the FDA for initiating clinical trials in order to obtain commercial utilization of rhMFG-E8 as a safe and effective therapy for patients with sepsis and septic shock.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II research project addresses an unfilled need in the composites manufacturing and repair industry. Current manufacturing and repair methods for curing Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastic (CFRP) composite materials do not employ real time temperature feedback from the critical interior of parts or repair bond lines because no practical sensors can be permenantly embedded to report to a remote reader. This Phase II Project will lead to the commercialization of three complementary products designed to provide this capability so as to improve curing processes. Product 1 is an inexpensive microwire temperature sensor that is easy to use and does not negatively affect structural integrity. Product 2 is an autoclave/oven control system: modular antennas that reside inside the hot chamber and a reader with control software outside that combine to control the curing process via real-time temperature feedback from embedded sensors. Product 3 is a temperature-sensing accessory for all existing portable composite repair systems. This accessory allows existing repair systems, without modification, to monitor temperature from embedded Product 1 sensors. These complementary products will vastly improve legacy curing processes by cutting curing times, reducing labor, and reducing the number of rejected parts due to uncontrolled exotherm.  The commercial aircraft industry's rapidly expanding use of CFRP composites is driving the marketplace demand for process\nenhancements that increase efficiency, yield and part quality. If successful the outcome of this project will address the needs of control system manufacturing companies, end-user companies and commercial aircraft manufacturers. The low cost of the microwire sensors and the anticipated improvements to the speed of legacy curing processes both for initial cure and repair may accelerate the use of CFRP composites within the automobile industry. This should result in reduced fuel/energy usage worldwide. Furthermore, the extremely low thermal mass of these microwire temperature sensors gives them such fast thermal response that they may allow for the development of unconventional and faster composite curing systems and processes that employ real time feedback, such as microwave ovens for initial cure and induction heating devices for repair cure, further speeding overall industry use of composites. Finally, microwire temperature sensing technology holds promise for remote measurement of internal temperatures of lithium ion batteries for electric and hybrid cars.",

        "abstract": "Roughly two-thirds of the fuel used in electric power plants to generate electricity is wasted in the form of dissipated heat.  An opportunity exists to maximize the use of this heat for heating and cooling needs by generating power and using the waste heat on-site, the concept behind combined heating and power (CHP) systems.  Because there is a greater coincidence of cooling and electricity needs compared to heat and electricity needs, efficient cooling and refrigeration equipment, which utilizes the waste heat to create cooling, is essential to maximize waste heat utilization.  This project will develop refrigeration cycles based on use of metal hydride slurry technology.  Although metal hydrides have been under development for another application (for storage and transport of hydrogen in future hydrogen vehicle applications), recent work has shown that these materials would be viable for use in absorption refrigeration cycles.  Phase I involved analysis and initial feasibility studies for metal hydride slurry refrigeration cycles.  A prototype metal hydride slurry chiller will be developed in Phase II. Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Metal hydride slurry chillers and refrigeration systems would be expected to improve the energy savings and economic attractiveness of CHP systems, helping to increase the adoption of such systems, particularly in large commercial buildings and industry.

        "abstract": "The future use of coal, which is projected to remain a mainstay of energy consumption well into the 21st century, will require efficient, low emission ultra-supercritical coal-fired boilers.  The high operating temperature, along with the oxidizing, corroding, and slag-deposition-induced microclimate environment of these systems have generated a critical need for new cladding techniques.  Due to the high cost of the alloys used for cladding, this project will develop reduced-thickness cladding materials that maintain their high temperature corrosion resistance.  Phase I developed and demonstrated a high-power diode laser cladding process that yielded low-dilution high-performance alloy clads that were less than 750microns (0.030\u00c2\u00bf) in thickness.   Very thin and smooth low-slag-adhesion clad layers of alloy C22 were welded onto supercritical tube components at economical deposition rates.  Phase II will develop laser cladding processes for ultra-supercritical alloys (IN72, IN52, Alloy 33), test these corrosion resistant alloys at temperatures exceeding 760\u00c2\u00b0C, and code-certify the processes for pressure tubing and water wall panels.  Manufacturability will be enhanced via improvements to the laser cladding nozzle and power feeder, laser cladding optics, and overall laser system robustness. Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  For supercritical coal-fired boilers, the technology should satisfy the demand for cladding of super heater and reheater pipe, tubes and panels, and upper and lower water wall components.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to reduce the cost and risk of manufacturing nanoparticle/resin blends for coatings.

Both steps are characterized by high cost, high environmental impact, or both. This new process reduces manufacturing steps, lowers cost and avoids direct exposure to hazardous nanopowders.  The broader impacts/commercial potential of this project is the creation of a roadmap for development of nanoparticle-containing coatings/composites by a one-step process. Potential cost savings are anticipated to be 25% or substantially more compared to existing processes. Coating performance enhancements not otherwise attainable are anticipated as well. Most importantly, health risks posed by inhalation of nanoparticulate powders, currently of unknown toxicity, are completely avoided.

The objective of this Phase II project is to develop a web- based language-study program that will improve the medical English and communicative skills of foreign-trained nursing professionals. Evaluation of the Phase I prototype demonstrated that an interactive language study program was a highly feasible and desirable way to increase the medical English proficiency of foreign- trained nurses. During Phase II, a technically enhanced language acquisition software system with vastly expanded curricula will be developed and evaluated with 120 representative participants via a 12-month intervention. Criteria for evaluation include quantitative data based on healthcare professionals' acquisition of target language skills, as well as their qualitative feedback throughout the course of their studies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In light of the significant nursing shortage in America, healthcare institutions are increasingly relying on a supply of foreign-trained personnel to provide adequate nursing care to their patients. An increasing number of these nurses of these nurses now come from non-English speaking countries and have suboptimal levels of medical English proficiency.

During this Phase II project, the research team will generate a library of over several hundred custom- designed documents in English and render them into over a dozen frequently encountered foreign languages. The system will be field-tested at a diverse group of healthcare facilities, generating a wealth of data that will allow the research team to evaluate its impact on the provision of language assistance services, the quality of patient care, and patient-provider communication. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The aim of this project is to create an advanced knowledge management system for the creation and distribution of multilingual documents. This web-based system will be accessible to medical facilities of all sizes and geographic locations. Given the current shortage of language services and translated materials for limited English proficiency (LEP) patients, this innovative system offers institutions the necessary resources to provide linguistically concordant care to a diverse patient population. Proper communication is instrumental in ensuring quality care for patients with LEP and low functional health literacy. Improved patient-provider communication can serve to mitigate such adverse health outcomes as extended length of stay, increased frequency of diagnostic tests, misdiagnosis, and general dissatisfaction with healthcare.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  RNA interference offers the potential of a novel therapeutic approach for treating skin disorders. The ability to design, screen and identify potent, selective and stable small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) is now relatively straightforward. Unfortunately, methodologies to deliver these potential therapeutics to appropriate cells (including skin cells) have not kept pace. The long-term goal of this project is to develop effective and efficient siRNA skin delivery technologies, facilitating translation of siRNA therapeutics to the clinic. In Phase I, we investigated and identified a number of animal models that readily allow monitoring (including in vivo whole animal imaging) of functional siRNA activity in skin keratinocytes, characterized the stability of siRNAs under a variety of conditions related to delivery and analyzed the distribution of fluorescently-tagged siRNAs in mouse and human skin. In Phase 2, we utilize innovative siRNA skin delivery technologies and monitor their effectiveness in the model systems developed in Phase 1. Furthermore, the development and application of a dual-axes confocal (DAC) intravital imaging system allows noninvasive monitoring of the effectiveness of functional siRNA in individual cells in real time by visualization of reporter gene expression in transgenic murine skin. To take full advantage of this imaging system, functional siRNAs that are effective in the mouse model systems will be labeled with near infrared dyes that allow visualization in mouse skin at the cellular level. These tools now afford the opportunity in Phase 2 to efficiently screen, develop and optimize delivery technologies in a way that has not been possible previously. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Despite the exciting discoveries of the underlying mutations responsible for a large number of genodermatoses, few if any novel clinical treatments have emerged. The purpose of this proposal is to harness the potential of RNA interference, utilizing short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that have picomolar efficacy, single nucleotide specificity, and relatively low toxicity profiles to target mutant disease-causing genes, particularly for dominant negative genetic skin disorders. The largest remaining hurdle for bringing siRNAs to the clinic is an effective delivery platform. In Phase 1, we set up appropriate animal models for evaluating siRNA delivery and in Phase 2, we utilize these animal models to optimize existing  genecream  formulations to topically delivery the inhibitors. In theory, the platform technology developed should be applicable to a large number of the approximately 2,000 known monogenic skin disorders currently afflicting patients.",

In addition to superior high-temperature performance, niobium-based intermetallics could offer significant cost savings over conventional refractory alloys.  This project will expand research and developmental efforts on this innovative class of refractory metal intermetallic composites, providing alternatives to the refractory, ceramic, and composite materials that are presently used or being considered for high temperature applications in Generation IV nuclear energy systems.  In Phase I, a preliminary analysis of the microstructure- properties of these alloys was conducted, which will serve as a baseline for nuclear reactor-specific requirements.  Phase II will explore alloy compositions that are most suitable for irradiated reactor environments.  Both non-irradiated and irradiated materials will be tested to demonstrate the potential of these alloys for nuclear systems.Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The use of these alloys in nuclear reactors and industrial gas turbines should provide an opportunity to increase energy efficiency through higher reactor/turbine operating temperatures. This in turn will help to reduce dependence on fossil fuel in power generation, allowing for continued economic growth worldwide without the associated environmental damage",

        "abstract": "Trellis installation is a major expense for establishing new commercial blackberry or raspberry (bramble) plantings. Research by the USDA and universities clearly demonstrates that by developing novel trellis designs and methods of manipulating bramble canes, costs of labor for cane pruning and training and winter injury can be reduced and hand-and mechanically-harvested efficiency, fruit quality and yield can all be improved. A system like the Rotatable Cross Arm (RCA) improves hand harvest efficiency, can be combined with a winter protection technique and is amenable to harvesting fresh market quality fruit with an over-the-row mechanical harvester. But, the high cost of trellis posts and hardware has limited the expansion of this system into the commercial sector. In Phase I of this SBIR project, Trellis Growing Systems (TGS), LLC proved the feasibility of an improved modular trellis concept. Based on the RCA design, TGS, in partnership with USDA and Cornell University, developed the AV trellis system. Phase I included successful demonstration of laboratory load testing on fiber reinforced trellis post, cross arm components and aluminum brackets and hardware. Phase I also included successful field trials of the RCA and AV trellis systems at TGS (Fort Wayne, IN), Cornell University (Ithaca, NY) and USDA-ARS (Kearneysville, WV). Phase I efforts also focused on reducing the estimated production cost of the RCA trellis design by 50 percent. At the end of Phase I, TGS reduced costs by 46 percent; Phase II will focus on surpassing the 50 percent cost reduction goal. Phase II will also focus on researching innovative manufacturing technology to design fiber reinforced low-cost components. These components must offer easy in-ground installation, the ability to be configured to create a range of designs needed for commercial bramble production and offer easy disassembly. Phase II will continue the successful partnerships offered in Phase I with the USDA (Kearneysville, WV) and Cornell University (Ithaca, NY). Efforts will focus on RCA Trellis System for blackberries at USDA and on AV trellis systems for high tunnel production of red raspberries and black raspberries at Cornell University. Phase II objectives are: (1) design and prototype rotatable cross arm (RCA) and adjustable V (AV) trellis systems; (2) lab test trellis system components; (3) field test prototype systems for structural integrity and functionality; (4) beta test prototype systems with growers and research institutions; (5) analyze costs (material, manufacturing, packaging and shipping); (6) measure and quantify the value of product features; and, (7) develop final reports. Successful completion of Phase II objectives will lead to the commercialization of the AV trellis system. Potential markets include both commercial producers as well as home gardeners. Based on a technology niche assessment conducted by Foresight Science and Technology, a new light-weight, easy to install and affordable trellis system offers extensive promise in today's marketplace.",

        "abstract": "Concerns over the escalating use of petroleum-based liquid fuels include climate change, trade imbalances, global security issues, and environmental harm resulting from petroleum extraction and processing.  Although ethanol is the leading replacement for petroleum-based gasoline, the current corn-based source of ethanol is hindered by serious social and environmental issues.  The production of cellulosic ethanol from lignocellulosic feedstocks \u00c2\u00bf including straws, corn stalks, and woody biomass \u00c2\u00bf represents a key, underutilized resource in our energy portfolio.  In particular, the effective utilization of xylose would make a much higher fraction of the biomass viable as source materials for cellulosic ethanol.  Therefore, this project will develop a next-generation system for increased xylose utilization in the ethanol-production process.  In this approach, an industrial enzyme, xylose isomerase, is used to convert xylose to xylulose.  Then, familiar brewing yeasts could metabolize the xylulose to ethanol.  In Phase I, the feasibility of utilizing xylose by having a separate reactor convert it to xylulose was demonstrated.  Phase II will design, build, and characterize a 200-liter-scale xylose isomerization and fermentation system, and the operating conditions needed to achieve high productivity of the isomerase enzyme will be determined.  A pilot system (4000 liters) will be built in year 2 of the project. Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Commercial application of the isomerization technology would expand the economic viability of cellulosic ethanol and increase the sustainability of the US liquid fuel supply.  Success with this technology would contribute to meeting the ambitious national targets for the use of alternative fuels in the next decade",

However, coal has a range of environmental disadvantages, which include emissions of selenium via the flue gas and via environmental releases during the subsequent processing and disposal of byproducts.  The development of selenium management technology is complicated by a limited understanding of selenium chemistry in pollution control systems and by challenges in measuring the amount and form of selenium in these systems.  This project will develop technology to reduce selenium water discharges from coal-fired power plants equipped with flue gas desulfurization units.  In Phase I, a selenium control strategy was developed, and laboratory tests were conducted to identify the conditions under which selenium could be converted into a chemical form that can be removed easily from the wastewater.  In Phase II, additional laboratory tests will be conducted to further refine the selenium control strategy.  Then, pilot-scale tests at an electric utility will be conducted to demonstrate the technology on a larger scale using actual flue gas from a coal-fired power plant. Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The technology should have extensive commercial applications in the electric utility industry at both new and existing coal-fired power plants equipped with wet flue gas desulfurization scrubbing systems.

Current commercially available instruments are limited in their accuracy in real world conditions due to their design. They are also expensive due to the use of costly components such as lamps, filter wheels, spectrometers, etc. This project will explore the use of a novel patented construction method in combination with light sources, optics, and photodiodes to give scientists an accurate yet low cost research tool to measure absorption in-situ over a variety of wavelengths. Compared to currently available instruments, this instrument will be more sensitive, have a broader dynamic range, will be insensitive to interfering parameters (e.g. scattering) and will be able to measure in the ultraviolet region.  If successful the proposed product will help the scientific and general public communities better understand water quality in the natural world but also it could be of considerable benefit in broader kinds of chemical processing. Current commercially available in-situ absorbance instruments lack accuracy in field conditions and are relatively expensive. Hence they have not been widely adopted in the scientific community. A more accurate in-situ absorption meter dramatically improves the quality of the data that scientists can generate and reduces the amount of time they spend correcting for interfering parameters. The proposed instrument will address significant needs of organizations measuring water to understand natural processes as well as to determine water quality. A number of applications to measurements of other turbid liquids will be possible.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There currently is a real need for a long term and objective alcohol biomarker to both monitor alcohol-impaired healthcare professionals, and to aid in the selection of organ transplant recipients, particularly liver transplant recipients. We recently concluded a Phase I study that compared the presence of the direct alcohol biomarker ethyl glucuronide (EtG) in hair samples from non-drinkers to hair samples obtained from problem drinkers (hair was chosen because of its 3-month exposure window to various drugs). As an alcohol biomarker EtG distinguished the drinkers from the non-drinkers with a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity approaching 100%. To determine the utility of EtG in hair and fingernail clippings as a long-term alcohol biomarker we are proposing a Phase II study that will involve two distinct population groups. One population group will consist of college students (approximately 600) that represent a span of drinking behaviors from little or no drinking to heavy and binge drinking. From this population we will determine the dose response of alcohol consumed to the amount of EtG found in the hair and fingernails. Extent of alcohol consumption by student volunteers will be determined using the technique of timeline followback interviews. The second population group studied will consist of impaired health care professionals suffering from alcohol abuse who are entering an alcohol treatment center and who will be sequestered from alcohol during treatment. From this population we will determine the half-time of the  washout  rate of EtG under normal hair washing and treating conditions. Hair and fingernail samples will be obtained from the volunteers at admittance, half-way through the treatment program, and upon release from the treatment program. From these samples an average half-life of EtG in hair and fingernails will be determined and from these data an average window of detection of EtG in hair and fingernails will be extrapolated. The data obtained in this Phase II study will establish the parameters of the presence of EtG in hair and fingernail samples, and will validate the conditions by which EtG in hair and/or fingernails can be used to either monitor alcohol-impaired healthcare professionals or aid in the selection of organ transplant recipients. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There is an immediate need for an objective means of determining alcohol ingestion by two population groups: 1) alcohol-impaired healthcare professionals undergoing treatment while continuing to practice their profession, and 2) potential organ transplant recipients, particularly liver transplant recipients. The presence of the direct alcohol biomarker ethyl glucuronide in hair and/or fingernail clippings has considerable potential as a means of objectively monitoring alcohol ingestion by these two groups and facilitating their management.",

Hu and Fox) and their collaborators have investigated additional treatment combinations that can significantly augment the therapeutic efficacy of vaccines. The combination of these strategies with this vaccine technology (DRibbles) in preclinical animal models further increased priming/expansion of tumor-specific T cells and provided a significant survival advantage for the DRibble vaccine strategy. Based on the data generated in UBIVAC's Phase I SBIR, a pilot Clinical Trial of Autologous NSCLC DRibbles was initiated (R21-CA123864). This Investigator-initiated trial just opened and autologous DRibble vaccine has been successfully made for the first eligible patient. UBIVAC, LLC, has one candidate NSCLC cell line (adenocarcinoma) that over expresses a large number of genes in common with seven other NSCLC cell lines screened, grows well and is a good producer of supernatant DRibbles. Before this SBIR Phase II award is initiated, UBIVAC will use the same criteria listed above to identify a second cell line (of squamous origin) for production of DRibbles. In Aim 1 UBIVAC will generate a master cell bank (MCB) for each cell line, test the MCBs for sterility, generate WCBs and optimize DRibble production using CMC specifications from the FDA-approved autologous NSCLC DRibble IND and produce sufficient vaccine to complete the 48 patient trial. Aim 2 will conduct a randomized phase II trial of docetaxel and allogeneic NSCLC DRibble vaccine combined with either GM-CSF or imiquimod (DRibble Plus) Aim 3 will evaluate the humoral immune response induced by Universal NSCLC DRibble Plus vaccine. It will also investigate whether vaccination reduces the number of circulating tumor cells (CTC), a biomarker that has the potential to be a surrogate for clinical response. UBIVAC, LLC has a letter of intent that could provide 2 to 50 million dollars to support the commercial development of DRibble technology if the proposed phase II SBIR study is successful. To help guide this transition UBIVAC has assembled an advisory board that includes a successful president/CEO with more than 40 years Pharma experience; a physician- scientist with large Pharma oncology experience who served as Global Head Vaccines and Immunomodulatory Agents; and the managing Director of Northwest Technology Ventures. Taken together, UBIVAC has the critical elements, compelling preclinical data, Individuals with substantial clinical, translational research, business and venture experience, a well designed randomized phase II study and cutting edge monitoring strategies that hold great promise to make a difference in the lives of patients with NSCLC, and the experience to get this agent to market.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful completion of the randomized Phase II clinical trial of UBIVAC's two promising NSCLC Dribble Plus vaccines (DPV-1 + GM-CSF or imiquimod) will allow UBIVAC to  pick-the-winner , arrange funding and/or a strategic partner and provide a compelling argument to move the lead product forward into a randomized Phase III clinical trial for advanced NSCLC.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project concerns an innovative high throughput, high efficiency, and low cost heterogeneous catalytic fixed-bed technology for biodiesel production from Alaska fish oil. Around 200 remote Alaskan villages have energy costs of three to five times the national average. Alaskan fisheries are suffering from high diesel fuel cost. Converting the low-value fish oil to biodiesel is an attractive solution. However, the commercially available homogeneous alkali-catalyzed biodiesel production process does not work well for fish oil. The objectives of this Phase II project are to scale-up the fixed-bed reactor, produce prototype reactors, conduct field testing in Alaska, and prepare for commercial production.  The broader impacts of this research are as follows: the success of this project will create a value-added and profitable market for fish oil, reduce damage to the marine environment, and provide Alaska with a renewable fuel that will in turn reduce diesel emissions and fuel costs for remote communities and fisheries. The fixed-bed reactor can be a mobile unit for small fish oil production entities or can be easily scaled up for potential customers that produce a large quantity of fish oil. In addition to fish oil, this reactor can be used to process vegetable oil and yellow grease and can be applied to other biodiesel production plants in the U.S. The success of this new technology will bring a revolutionary change to the traditional biodiesel production process.",

        "abstract": "Currently, most biodiesel is produced commercially by a homogeneous-catalyst-based transesterification process, wherein soybean oil is reacted with methanol in the presence of sodium methoxide.  After transesterification, the homogeneous alkaline catalyst remains mixed with the biodiesel and the byproduct glycerol.  The purification of the biodiesel and glycerol, by removing the homogeneous alkaline catalyst, is an energy and labor-intensive operation that produces a waste stream.  Productivity is restricted by the need to use a batch reactor and the need for a long reaction time.  In addition, the glycerol byproduct has low quality.  This project will develop a novel structured heterogeneous-catalyst technology for high-efficiency, high-throughput, and low-cost biodiesel production in a continuous-flow fixed-bed reactor.  The unique design of the structured catalyst will improve the catalyst utilization efficiency and overall activity, and will protect the catalyst from deactivation.  In Phase I, the structured catalyst was successfully prepared with the required physical properties and catalytic performance.  The operating conditions for the fixed-bed reactor were determined, and an economic analysis was conducted.  Phase II will move the technology from laboratory scale to pilot scale, and demonstrate commercial viability.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The use of the structured-catalyst fixed-bed technology in biodiesel production should significantly simplify product separation and purification, increase biodiesel productivity, reduce plant size, remove the need for a constant feed of catalyst, improve glycerol quality, eliminate the waste stream, and reduce capital and processing costs.

        "abstract": "Lighting consumes approximately 22% of the total electricity generated in the U.S.  To reduce this energy use, new high-efficiency solid-state light sources, such as Organic Light Emitting Diodes (OLEDs), are needed.  An OLED is potentially an inexpensive diffuse source that would complete directly with, and offer a \u00c2\u00bfgreen\u00c2\u00bf alternative to, conventional light sources.  However, improvements in the overall efficiency of these devices are required before they can become commercially viable products and attain expected goals for cost ($3 per 1000 lumens) and performance (150 im/W).  This project will utilize novel outcoupling enhancement features in OLED architectures to enable highly-efficient solid-state lighting sources to replace short-lifetime incandescent sources.  Phase I demonstrated that the integration of a low index grid into the OLED device enhanced light outcoupling.  Using non-optimized materials, a 15% increase in device light output was achieved.  During Phase II, the low index grid will be optimized to obtain a 40% outcoupling enhancement. Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Today, OLED technology is the leading emerging technology for flat panel displays (FEDs), with recent product introductions in cell phones and TV\u00c2\u00bfs.  Many of the features desired for FPDs are also making OLED technology of great interest to the solid-state lighting community. Because OLEDs are bright and thin, with desirable color rendering indices and excellent power efficiency at low voltages, they are expected to provide significant energy savings for general lighting",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this research proposal is to further develop a potent oral vaccine platform that is reusable for different pathogens and can be manufactured more rapidly and at lower cost than currently available vaccine technology. Rapid production time and ease of distribution of a vaccine in pill form will provide for an effective countermeasure against influenza and other potential pandemic viruses. Studies funded by Vaxart's Phase 1 SBIR have demonstrated that an expressed Toll Receptor 3 ligand, given in conjunction with antigen expressed from a non-replicating adenovirus vector significantly augments the adaptive immune response to oral vaccination, and is protective against avian influenza challenge in large animals. An effective gene-based technology must overcome the major obstacles of pre-existing and vaccine-induced immunity to the vector if it is to be used as a general platform for multiple antigens or boosting. Our results demonstrate that the oral vaccine route effectively circumvents vaccine induced immunity problems that occur with injected vector vaccines, which will allow the vector backbone to be reused without loss of activity. In Phase II, we propose to further develop and test vaccine effectiveness, formulation and safety in preparation for clinical testing. In Aim 1 of this proposal we will test the effectiveness of our oral vaccine to protect against cross-clade avian influenza challenge. Aim 2 provides a formulation path for oral drug product development. Aim 3 validates an animal model for pre-clinical safety testing for an enterically delivered oral vaccine. Aims 4 and 5 test for the biodistribution pattern and safety profile of oral vaccine capsule administration in animals. Together, the results from these aims will provide the pre-clinical data required to begin clinical testing of Vaxart's oral avian flu vaccine. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Vaxart is developing a new oral vaccination technology, which can be used to rapidly develop and manufacture effective vaccines for use against emerging pathogens including new strains of influenza virus; the technology can shorten the time from identified influenza strain to released product from 7 months to 4 months. With our flexible oral vaccine technology, genes from any pathogen can be rapidly inserted into this vaccine backbone, and manufactured into a vaccine using a highly efficient, standardized, GMP process. In addition, a significant advantage to developing a vaccine in pill form is the ease of administration in emergency situations such as pandemic, and in regions of the world that lack sufficient medical personnel.",

The goals of this authoring tool are: 1) to support the creation of instructional materials that assist Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing (HH) students in the elementary and middle grades in learning to read; 2) to support the creation of animated ASL stories, including the full range of ASL grammar, that can be enjoyed by Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing students; and 3) to provide a tool that can be used by older students, at the secondary and university levels, to learn about the ASL by creating animated ASL passages. The project includes the development and testing of exemplary reading instruction for Deaf students reading at grade level K-6.  The research will result in improved, computer-based reading instruction for the 50,000+ K-12 Deaf/HH students in the U.S. whose first language is ASL, as well as students that are taking ASL courses. Currently, Deaf children are delayed in developing language skills, to the extent that the average reading level of a Deaf high school graduate is no greater than 4th grade. Since Deaf children have difficulty developing phonemic awareness, and are often isolated from contextual information available to hearing students, teaching reading to Deaf children requires the application of several unique methods that go far beyond simply translating English text. By providing educators and developers of educational software with products that allow them to develop personalized signing avatar tutors for Deaf children, this project will make possible the creation of instruction that is available 'anytime, anywhere' for assisting Deaf children in developing literacy skills.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Plasma-derived human serum albumin (pHSA) or bovine serum albumin are commonly added to cell culture media used in cell culture-based vaccine and therapeutic production, because it enhances cell growth and increases protein productivity. However, the use of pHSA carries the risk of transmission of viruses and emerging infectious pathogens, particularly for those for which no tests are available. Because millions of people are immunized annually with cell culture- based vaccines and millions more require cell culture-based therapeutics for the treatment of various disorders, regulatory agencies have called for a replacement of pHSA in vaccine and therapeutic production with recombinant HSA (rHSA). In Phase I feasibility study, we showed that rHSA from rice can not only be used to replace pHSA but also outperform pHSA by 51% in cell growth enhancement and by 50% in antibody production. In phase II, we will extend the studies in phase I to test the effect of rHSA on cell growth and productivity of hybridoma, CHO and Vero cells in larger scale cell culture with commercial media. We will also attempt to identify which factor(s) is (are) responsible for the superior performance of our rHSA preparation from rice. We will initiate a breeding program to improve the grain yield so to further reduce cost rHSA production. We anticipate that at the end of phase II studies, our project will have addressed the call by regulatory agencies for a safe alternative to pHSA in vaccine and therapeutic production by providing to the market rHSA with superior performance. Public Health Relevance: Safety concerns regarding human-to-human transmission of emerging infectious pathogens from the use of plasma-derived human serum albumin (pHSA) and blood products as an ingredient in cell culture media for cell-based vaccine and therapeutic production exist. Regulatory agencies have called for the replacement of pHSA with recombinant HSA. In response, an inexpensive source of recombinant HSA produced in rice would not only assure a safe alternative to pHSA, but would also allow cost- effective production of cell-based vaccine and therapeutics.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will build an end-to- end platform around the ambulatory monitoring device proposed in Phase I, for continuous health monitoring of a human. The Phase I wearable device measures multiple noninvasive biosignals from a person in their daily home routine (or in the hospital), providing unprecedented visibility into health or disease status outside a critical care setting. The Phase II platform will comprise an \"\"ecosystem\"\" of software for providing automated, scalable intelligent monitoring of the signals from the device using advanced machine-learning algorithms, and exception-based alerting of medical staff upon early indication of deteriorating health of an ambulatory patient.  If successful this platform will provide a substantial improvement in the capability of the healthcare system to proactively manage the health of the large population of patients with costly chronic diseases. Current methods for remote (home) patient monitoring \"\"while better than a complete lack of monitoring\"\" involve extremely sparse data (once per day) and require proactive patient compliance to make manual measurements, typically of weight or blood pressure. These methods do not handle ambulatory variation; in contrast, the proposed algorithms uniquely detect health anomalies\notherwise hidden in ambulatory variation. This Phase II project not only has the potential to fundamentally improve healthcare with continuous automated visibility into patient health in the home environment, but also stands to provide unique insight into new signatures of disease heretofore not recognized by medical science. The advanced detection algorithms are able to learn empirically the normal physiological variation (e.g., variations in blood pressure, metabolic activity, etc., throughout the day) of the human system, and reveal incipient anomalies from normal behavior which are not visible upon a plain, univariate inspection of the data. Moreover, the device itself provides data from human activities not customarily encountered in the static conditions of a medical facility, where patients are supine and sedated. It is highly likely that this new approach to multivariate analysis of human biosignals will unveil new signatures providing early warning of disease progression, for example, decompensation in a heart failure patient.",

The effort will further exploit the basic technology at the core of the condition monitoring & assessment (CM&A) product being developed by Veros Systems. Inc., and will become a key feature of that product. This monitoring technology is sensorless, in that only electrical measurements, i.e. voltages and currents available at the motor control centers, are utilized. No information from mechanical sensors, such as speed, torque, vibration or temperature, is necessary. Consequently, this reliable and effective CM&A technology is cost-effective and cost-scalable. The proposed approach to efficiency estimation is based on employing the raw electrical measurements that are collected for use by the existing CM&A product framework, and augmenting them with adaptive filters for accurate estimation. The Phase II research plan calls for the refinement of the online, in-service efficiency estimation algorithms defined in the previous Phase I effort.  The broader impacts of the project include awareness of the importance of energy efficiency in industrial motors, which account for about 25% of all electricity sold in the U.S. Widespread adoption of\nthis energy conversion efficiency estimation technology could reduce the total energy consumption by industrial motors up to an estimated 18%. These energy conversion efficiency costs, together with the costs of maintaining electric motors and the costs of lost production associated with motor downtime are among the most significant controllable costs of industrial establishments.  Even a modest adoption of more effective CM&A and efficiency estimation technologies would eliminate some fraction of this waste and have a significant impact on the U.S. economy, while enabling clients to reduce their energy costs, increase profitability, reduce fuel imports and lower greenhouse emissions.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long range goal of this project is to create technologies that permit authors and publishers of professional journals to make their content available in the DAISY (Digital Accessible Information System) XML (eXtensible Markup Language) format that is fully usable by all people, in particular by people who are blind or have other severe print disabilities. The Phase I collaboration between the American Physical Society (APS) and ViewPlus demonstrated conclusively that transformation of the text and math from the current APS format to DAISY XML is straightforward, and only minimal editorial time is required to transform figures to the accessible DAISY SVG (Scalable Vector Graphic) format. The specific aim of this Phase II SBIR project is to develop publishing software and procedures permitting present content to be repurposed so that at least minimal quality DAISY XML journal articles can be made available immediately. The APS is expected to implement the new publishing method first and then be followed by other scholarly publishers. Several other software applications will also be developed that enable authors to submit figures directly in high quality DAISY SVG form so that future DAISY XML publications will be much more than minimal. DAISY SVG figures can:  contain all the data illustrated in the figure  contain meta data facilitating much improved classification by digital libraries  be excellently searchable. These mainstream advantages of DAISY SVG are substantial and are very likely to lead authors of scholarly literature to quickly adopt DAISY SVG as their format of choice. As part of the Phase I project, DAISY prototypes were created for all articles in a recent issue of Physical Review Letters, the flagship journal of the American Physical Society. These prototypes were complete with fully accessible text, math, and graphics. They were demonstrated at three 2008 professional meetings of scholarly publishers and librarians to rave reviews. Text and math is spoken by a screen reader. DAISY SVG figures appear in the DAISY article and are available as SVG links to blind users. Exercising the link opens the figure in the IVEO SVG Viewer. A blind user creates a tactile copy on any ViewPlus embosser, places it on a touchpad, and  reads  the text labels and titles and descriptions of graphical elements by pressing on their tactile image and hearing them spoken by the IVEO SVG Viewer application. This audio- tactile access method is known to provide blind people excellent access to figures. This new publishing paradigm would vastly improve accessibility by people with print disabilities to scholarly publications and lead to improvements in their educational and professional opportunities and quality of life. Quality of life issues for blind people are part of the mission of the National Eye Institute.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ultimate goal of this research is to provide integrated systems that allow complex biological samples to be analyzed with high sensitivity and broad dynamic range. These systems are applicable to proteins, DNA and RNA oligomers, and metabolites from bodily fluids and tissues. This project is specifically focused on developing novel sample plates employing collimated hole structures that allow a variety of separation techniques to be efficiently coupled to MALDI-TOF and TOF-TOF mass spectrometry. Phase I established the basic feasibility of the new MALDI plates for interfacing with several widely used separation techniques including HPLC and slab gel electrophoresis, and with direct imaging of frozen tissue sections. Phase II will produce a new family of MALDI sample plates optimized for these applications and devices for interfacing with a variety of techniques for efficiently separating peptides, proteins, and metabolites. These devices integrated with new MALDI-TOF MS and MS-MS instruments being developed in parallel projects will provide orders of magnitude improvements in capabilities for global analysis of complex biological samples. Specific aims for Phase II are focused on practical MALDI sample plates employing collimated hole structures optimized for selected applications, and on practical devices for interfacing MALDI MS and MS- MS with established techniques for efficiently separating peptides, proteins, and metabolites. The definition of a practical CHS plate for these applications is that it must be sufficiently inexpensive to be disposable after single use, or there must be a simple, reliable procedure for cleaning the plates with no detectable sample carry-over. These new MALDI sample plates, parallel digestion plates, and the apparatus and reagents required for their use will provide important new products for commercialization in Phase III. In addition, complete integrated systems combining output of this project with results from other projects being pursued concurrently at Virgin Instruments Corp. will provide products with much larger potential markets. These include a fully automated LC-MALDI MS-MS system for global biological analyses; an automated  Molecular Scanner  for protein analyses using gels and MALDI MS and MS-MS; integrated global analysis laboratory; and an automated high-speed tissue imager.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The human genome project has established the molecular approach to understanding biology, but present knowledge of how an organism functions at the molecular level is really very poor. Functional analyses must be carried out, not only at the level of gene expression (transcriptomics), but also at the level of protein translation and modification (proteomics), and the metabolite network (metabolomics). Further improvements in chemistry, separations science, mass spectrometry, and bio-informatics will be required to complete this revolution. The interface between separations and mass spectrometry is believed to be a major bottleneck. The proposed research will provide important new tools toward overcoming this obstacle.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the development of a UV curable bulk nanocomposite having enhanced optical and mechanical properties for ophthalmic lenses. The work focuses the incorporation of metal oxide nanoparticles into a transparent polymer to engineer the refractive index and mechanical properties. This requires the synthesis of stable nanoparticles approximately 20 nm or less in diameter. The nanoparticles require a surface treatment that will aid in the monomer stability and impart improved mechanical properties to the polymerized lens. The functionalized dispersion can then be incorporated into a second monomer and then polymerized into a finished ophthalmic eyeglass lens using the lens casting system currently used by several hundred Vision Dynamics LLC customers. This extends the capabilities of an independent retail dispenser to deliver quality eyeglass lenses to consumers in less than an hour. The project will further the understanding of nanocomposites which are a very unique and important material.  This SBIR Phase II project is directed toward the ophthalmic eyeglass lens market which is a $7B industry in the United States. Much of the eyeglass lenses in this industry are imported from overseas and through recent consolidations the three largest producers of lenses are\nforeign companies. If successful this technology removes the distribution rungs between the consumer and the optician, allowing independent retailers to more efficiently deliver quality eyewear to their customers. This allows retailers to continue to compete in this difficult landscape that has been dominated by acquisitions and mergers squeezing the independents. Furthermore, UV curing has been identified as a green coating technology for its low VOC emissions and low energy consumption. Currently UV cured polymers are limited in refractive index so this technology will play out in several industries.",

The technique must be noninvasive and must not require excessive manipulation of the globe. In addition, it must be amenable to acquisition  in the field,  at the donor bedside, since approximately half of eyes in the U.S. are excised in situ as corneo-scleral rims, rather than whole globes. Corneal topography currently consists of many technologies and surface representations for shape analysis, including surface height-based systems, as well as slope-based curvature systems. Our system utilizes a unique hardware system in combination with novel software algorithms to detect the presence of refractive surgery in donor eyes. Building on the successes of the Phase I work, Phase II will seek to validate this software prospectively through a study of a series of donor eyes collected as part of the grant. Additionally in Phase II, the use of additional classification methods, including Zernike coefficients with be explored and compared to other approaches. Further development in Phase III will seek preparation of the product for release and sales.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  KDOQI clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) improve dialysis patient care but their complexity makes them difficult to integrate into the dialysis clinic. Previous technological solutions  Electronic medical records, Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDS)  have failed because they were not integrated into the clinic workflow. Visonex LLC proposes to build and test (during Phases I and II) an innovative type of dialysis CDS that assists dialysis clinics to consistently conform to CPGs, provides workflow support and improves quality of care.         In order to test the innovation, this project will focuses on a selected subset of KDOQI CPGs. Increased adherence to these CPGs is associated with decreased risk of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. The software's workflow support will assist the clinic in responding faster and more accurately to CPG deviations and ensure completion of the tasks necessary to achieve conformance to CPG recommendations, improving the ability of the clinic to maintain mineral metabolism markers within their recommended ranges.         The software will be built during Phase I and undergo functional testing. It will then be tested using de-identified retrospective data from dialysis clinics. The software's results will be compared to those of manual chart reviews of the same data by clinicians. Any differences between clinician and software will be examined and used to refine the software's functionality before phase II.         In Phase II the software will be deployed and integrated into actual dialysis clinics in a stepwise manner. Further refinements will be made to increase the CDS's integration into clinic workflow based on information gathered during deployments. Phase II's overall aim is to increase the number of mineral metabolism markers maintained within the KDOQI recommended range for each patient. A supporting aim is to increase the number of CPG recommended tasks the clinic uses. All effects will be measured pre and post software deployment. The post deployment measures will occur after clinical acclimation to the CDS. While the study is not powered to look at mechanisms of improvement, a subset analysis will be performed with the intent of identifying trends, which could lead to future studies.         The end of phase II will result in a dialysis CDS that is quickly assimilated into a clinic's workflow and assists in identifying and treating patients according to the recommendations of the CPGs, which are associated with improved health and decreased mortality.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a public health crisis and dialysis is the most expensive phase of CKD. The proposed project will result in an integrated expert system that assists dialysis clinics in consistently conforming to guidelines, improves control of mineral metabolism, and becomes a tool for improving the quality of care delivered to patients on dialysis. This system will enrich the data set being collected, providing a new and previously unobtainable insight into clinic operations that can be used for future research.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): we proposed to develop a novel drug, 4-CI-KYN to treat neuropathic pain. 4-CI-KYN is a pro-drug of 7-Chlorokynurenic acid (7-Cl-KYNA), a chlorinated analogue of kynurenic acid, which is a natural neuromodulator and one of the most potent and specific GlyB antagonists known to man, which blocks glutamate transmission through the NMDA receptor. This receptor is important in mediating pain transmission, and drugs that block NMDA receptor produce analgesia. However, direct acting NMDA antagonists produce a number of side effects which have limited their therapeutic utility. In contrast, GlyB antagonists inhibit NMDA receptor function, reduce hyperalgesia and allodynia in neuropathic pain models, and have fewer side effects than classic NMDA receptor antagonists, making them a safer alternative as analgesics. 7-Cl-KYNA prevents excitotoxic and ischemic neuronal damage but like most GlyB antagonists does not cross the blood-brain barrier. 4-Cl-KYN, on the other hand, readily gains access to the brain following systemic administration and is efficiently converted to 7-Cl-KYNA specifically in brain areas with neuronal injury, and many believe that the hyperalgesia and allodynia associated with neuropathies originate from nerve damage or persistent activation and remodeling. Consequently, 4-Cl-KYN has a highly focused site of conversion in the CNS and spinal cord, and local concentrations of newly formed 7-Cl-KYNA are greatest at the site of therapeutic need. This reduces the level of systemic drug needed, and lowers the risk of side effects with long-term use of the drug. In our Phase I SBIR grant we showed that 4-Cl-KYN, which we refer to as AV-101, has potent antihyperalgesic actions in three models of peripheral tissue inflammation and nerve injury with no evidence of side effects. These preclinical studies support the efficacy of AV101 as an anti-hyperalgesic and its usefulness as a potential treatment of neuropathic pain. In subsequent studies, VistaGen developed an oral formulation of AV-101, conducted ADME analysis and subjected AV-101 to safety and toxicological assessments. Overall AV-101 is well tolerated, produces no safety or toxicity at doses that produce antihyperalgesic effects in animal models. Following on a positive pre-IND meeting with the FDA, we propose in this Phase II SBIR grant to conduct initial Phase 1 clinical safety evaluation of AV-101. The initial focus for our clinical development of AV-101 will be for the treatment of pain associated with human immunodeficiency virus-associated sensory neuropathy (HIV-SN). To begin the initial human testing of AV-101, we propose to conduct safety and pharmacokinetic studies in healthy human volunteers after single dose and repeated dosing of AV-101 to assess the maximum tolerated dose and the pharmacokinetic profiles of AV-101. AV-101 will also be tested in two pain models for efficacy in healthy human volunteers to gain an initial assessment of potential efficacy. These studies will provide the basis for Phase 2 clinical testing of AV-101 in treating neuropathic pain. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of the proposed project is to test the safety of AV-101 in healthy human volunteers in Phase I clinical trials, and to also generate preliminary data on AV-101's potential efficacy. VistaGen is focused on developing AV-101 as a treatment for neuropathic pain and other neurodegenerative disorders. Positive results from this study will serve as a basis for further development of AV-101 in Phase II trials for treatment of neuropathic pain.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): VitaCyte LLC is working to improve tissue dissociation enzymes (TDE) required for the isolation of insulin producing pancreatic islet cells from both human and porcine organs. Transplantation of islets into Type 1 Diabetic patients represents a promising therapy as means to replace administration of insulin by external factors. The development of the Edmonton Protocol demonstrated insulin independence in patients transfused with purified pancreatic islets. Insufficient islet yields arising from inconsistencies in TDE manufacturing have plagued continuing attempts to transfer this promising therapy to routine clinical practice. Improved biochemical assays have been used to correlate collagenase molecular forms with tissue dissociation. These data indicate the importance of each molecular form for different tissue types. The goal of this project is to develop a robust and reproducible manufacturing process using recombinant TDE that will improve the quality and commercial availability for both human allotransplantation and porcine xenotransplantation. Specifically, three recombinant constructs of Clostridia histolyticum collagenases: intact Class 2 (C2intact), intact Class 1 with two collagen binding domains (C1intact), and degraded C1 with a single collagen binding domain (C1100kDa) will be generated using standard molecular biology techniques. A large scale bacterial fermentation and expression production protocol will be developed by adopting current industry practices for production scale manufacturing to optimize expression yields. A column chromatography purification protocol will be developed using modifications to existing purification methods currently used in natural collagenase production. This process will be scaled for production of highly pure recombinant enzymes for use in islet isolation procedures. Finally, an assessment of the different molecular forms and their role in islet isolations will be determined in both human and porcine tissue both internally and at leading islet isolation centers. Using a standard modified Ricordi islet isolation procedure, the specific molecular form will be correlated to successful islet yield using design of experiment statistical control methods.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pancreatic islet transplantation represents a promising therapy for Type 1 Diabetic patients as a replacement for traditional insulin therapies. Hurdles to moving this therapy to routine clinical practice lies in achieving greater islet yields for either human allotransplantation or porcine xenotransplantation.

The device can serve as a destination therapy or as a  bridge device  to provide temporary access during maturation of an arteriovenous (AV) fistula. The device consists of a percutaneous access conduit, anastomosed to a central vein, i.e. the right jugular vein, that serves as an percutaneous access port. Dialysis is performed (three times weekly) by advancing a dual lumen, disposable catheter down the access conduit and into the vein. When not in use, the percutaneous access conduit is back filled with anti-microbial solution and is completely isolated from the circulation by an occluding obturator. The disposable obturator is removed and replaced between dialysis sessions. The technology has several advantages: 1) Anastomosis of the access conduit to the outside of the vein allows the device to reside outside the continuous blood path in the vein, as opposed to conventional, indwelling dialysis catheters. 2) The  outdwelling  configuration of this device will reduce thrombus, stenosis of the healthy vein, and potential for blood communication with the sinus tract. Preliminary in vitro and in vivo studies have identified procedural and design improvements required to reduce this system to clinical practice. The objective of this SBIR fast track proposal is to complete the clinical configuration design, build prototypes, perform in vitro performance and safety testing, and verify in vivo performance with chronic implants in sheep.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project involves the examination of consumer consumption behavior across multiple on-line domains to predict those items to be most likely consumed in the next interchange and the terms under which they will be consumed. The proposed innovation utilizes a persistent key technology to examine multiple attributes of identity to establish a unified identity that links individuals across multiple domains. Once linked the unified identity serves as the basis for the aggregation of consumption behavior (purchases, content, ads clicked through, invitations extended, etc.). The aggregated data establishes the consumer?s digital footprint and serves as the basis for creating highly-predictive models. The models analyze the actual consumption behavior to establish consumption propensity and terms of consumption on an industry segment level. The results of the propensity models will be returned to the client at the time of interaction to make up sell / cross sell offers that are most likely to result in action by the consumer. The result for the client is increased revenue for the transaction and the result for the consumer is increased satisfaction through the relevance of the offer.  The broader impact of the proposed innovation involves three aspects: Accelerating economic expansion, identifying potential domestic terror threats and identifying potential\non-line predatory activity.  The ability for a retail or social network to identify the consumption preferences of their customers and offer those items during an interaction increases the likelihood that a customer will purchase the offered item due to its relevance.

        "abstract": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).  This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop a 48 channel surface plasmon resonance (SPR) instrument and demonstrate a high throughput flow cell array for use with a variety of label-free biosensing platforms.  Flow cell technology is currently the limiting factor in the development of high throughput label-free sensing technologies. Modification of Wasatch Microfluidics Continuous Flow MicrospotterTM into a highly parallel flow cell should begin to eliminate this bottleneck and provide a template for even more highly parallel systems.  We will develop an understanding of how the proposed flow cell technology will impact the sensing capabilities of a commercial-ready surface plasmon resonance (SPR) instrument and an optimized baseline protocols will be developed.  The end result will be a 48 channel flow cell, which will be scalable to much higher throughputs (192, 1536).  This flow cell will be flexible such that it will be easily integrated with a variety of label-free sensing technologies.  The end result of this research and development effort will be an SPR instrument with approximately 10 times the capacity of the best current systems and will lay the ground work for much higher density systems.  The\nbroader impacts of this technology include the commercial opportunities of the Microfluidic Flow Cell Array (MFCA). The MFCA will be developed for integration with the biosensing platforms of a number of other companies.  Specifically we will target label-free technologies used to measure kinetic and affinity constants for binding of molecules to one another. This is currently a $100M/year market.  From our discussions with pharmaceutical companies, higher throughput label-free systems will lead to much larger implementation of these technologies and a significant commercial potential, including a larger market opportunity.  Even the most basic implementation of our flow cell will have a substantial impact.  Currently, it takes the flagship Biacore (GE) instrument up to 28 hrs to process 384 samples.  These same 384 samples would only take 1 hr with our proposed combined MFCA / SPR instrument utilizing our CFM technology.  These same instruments will then lead to substantially faster and more effective drug discovery processes, and eventually better health for the US population.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV viral load measurement in low-resource settings is an area of persistent need. A combination of two technologies holds great promise for improving access to HIV viral load measurement among underserved patient populations. The first is branched DNA (bDNA), a gold-standard nucleic acid chemistry which labels each strand of viral RNA with as many as 10,000 signaling molecules to enable detection of as few as 75 copies of viral RNA in a 1 mL plasma sample with low risk of test failure from sample contamination. The second is SCA microfluidic technology for high-performance on-cartridge sample/reagent processing with a static interface between cartridge and instrument. The starting point for this Phase II project is the successful Phase I work to shorten the bDNA assay's duration while simultaneously adapting the assay to an enclosed-cartridge format. The newly developed cartridge- format bDNA assay, the EO-NAT HIV Assay, includes re-engineered capture probes and signaling chemistry while retaining the original assay's multi-tiered probe configuration and high-specificity synthetic bases. Running in enclosed cartridges with cartridge-integrated SCA micropumps, the primary hybridization step in the bDNA assay has been speeded up eight-fold: whereas the primary hybridization step takes 16 hours running on conventional reference laboratory instruments, in the EO-NAT HIV cartridge-format assay this step requires only 120 minutes. Total test turnaround time has been reduced to less than four hours, a duration which facilitates treatment of HIV/AIDS patients with limited access to care, for whom achieving favorable clinical outcomes often depends on carrying out viral load testing and developing a management plan in the same visit. The Phase II project work incorporates two additional technological elements into the EO-NAT HIV assay. Detection of hybridized bDNA complexes is by a specialized form of electrochemiluminescence with sub- nanomolar concentrations of signaling molecules and multiplexing. Sample preparation, including lysing and preconcentration, is by cartridge-integrated photopolymerized monoliths. During the second year of Phase II, cartridges integrating all four technological elements-cartridge-optimized bDNA chemistry, SCA microfluidic technology, mECL detection, and extraction monoliths-are produced. These cartridges and prototype EO- NAT instruments are tested on clinical specimens to validate the clinical sensitivity and specificity of the system. In the final portion of Phase II, pilot ISO 13485-compliant manufacturing is ramped up in preparation for filings with regulatory agencies. The central hypothesis of this project is that the EO-NAT HIV Assay running on EO-NAT instruments detects as few as 50 copies of HIV RNA in 20 microliter samples with 98% sensitivity (n=100) and exhibits specificity greater than 90% in testing of negative samples (n=100). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Plasma viral load, determined by complex blood tests, is an indication of how sick an HIV/AIDS patient is and how well he or she is responding to treatment. Regular viral load measurement is important in caring for HIV/AIDS patients, but these tests are currently not available for everyone. This project develops a new system which makes viral load measurement less expensive and more readily available to doctors and patients who live far from sophisticated medical facilities.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is a direct response to an NIH-stated requirement for a system to  simulate piloting aircraft under hypothetical or actual drinking handicaps . This requirement, released by the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, recognizes that alcohol plays a significant role in serious (fatal) aircraft accidents in all three major aviation sectors: general, commercial and military.  Effects of alcohol on piloting skills are paid little attention in typical flight training programs. However, there is ample evidence that pilot training is most effectively done by having student pilots actually experience the flight conditions they must learn. The Federal Aviation Administration has certified the use of various types of flight simulators for training purposes. These flight simulators have been used very effectively, and are particularly useful in providing student pilots with experiences which might be unduly dangerous to attempt in actual flight conditions.  This project will lead to development of an Alcohol Effects Flight Simulator (AEFS) Trainer, which can augment flight simulators and mimic the consequences of flight under the effects of varying degrees of alcohol consumption. This will be done by performing a series of controlled experiments using prescribed flight protocols on a flight simulator without alcohol consumption (control) and with alcohol consumption (test groups). Deviations from the control conditions will be determined and implemented in the AEFS Trainer, which can then be used to teach sober pilots the likely effects of flight under the influence of alcohol as a function of amount consumed and time since consumption (as reflected by blood alcohol levels).  The AEFS Trainer will be a comprehensive training package, formatted to be familiar to pilots and consistent with the nature of other pilot training supplements. It can be used independently or with instruction, and can be used to view intoxicated pilot performance in real flight-time (both by video and computer-playable flight simulator files), to experience the simulation of some of the impairments that accrue to elevated blood alcohol content (BAC), or to compare actual intoxicated simulator flight profiles with mean data accumulated in our experimental databases.  This Phase II project comprises two main experiment tracks: 1) experiments with intoxicated pilots to determine real reactions to elevated BAC in a wide variety of flight regimes, and 2) training experiments with the AEFS Trainer to investigate short and long-term behavior modification in pilot drinking habits.  This project produced impressive Phase I results that have yielded new findings about the behavior of intoxicated pilots. The Phase II project will build on that work with the efforts of a very strong and diverse team. Personnel for this project encompass skill sets including:   research project management   SBIR product commercialization   experiment design   data reduction and analysis   software development   medicine   clinical psychology   alcohol behavior modification   aeronautics/simulation   flight training/education        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, has recognized that alcohol plays a significant role in serious (fatal) aircraft accidents in all major aviation sectors. Pilot training in this area is clearly inadequate, and is best addressed by hands-on learning experience. The proposed product development will lead to the Alcohol Effects Flight Simulator (AEFS) Trainer, augmenting existing flight simulator training programs to mimic or demonstrate piloting while intoxicated.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this project is to utilize a monoclonal antibody, MAG-1, to develop new, rational, and successful treatment of breast cancer. The hypothesis being tested is that Glycopeptide-Related cell-Surface Antigen (GRSA) will provide a sensitive and reliable target for the effective treatment of breast cancer by MAG-1 and related antibodies. The data from the studies of Phase 1 of the project clearly show that short-term (6 day) MAG-1 treatment of both estrogen-responsive and estrogen-resistant (triple-negative) human breast tumor xenografts, can not only prevent growth of the tumors but produce large decreases in size. This was found for the unmodified antibody as well as for 90Yttrium-labeled antibody. More significantly, longer-term (16 day) treatment with unmodified antibody prevents tumor re-growth by inducing massive necrosis. Our earlier data show GRSA expression is a feature common to all, or most, breast cancers and DCIS. It also shows GRSA-like antigens can be targeted in patients with antibodies, and that our MAG-1 monoclonal antibody not only recognizes GRSA in all breast tumors but also targets GRSA in vitro. Phase 2 is directed at advancing treatment of breast cancer with MAG-1 by developing a human chimeric form (cMAG-1) of the mouse monoclonal antibody, and then a humanized form (hMAG-1). The ability of cMAG-1 and hMAG-1 to target and treat human breast cancer xenografts in mice will then be tested. Phase 2 goals are directed towards (i) generating a chimeric form (cMAG-1) of MAG-1with the constant regions of human IgG; (ii) establishing that the targeting, recognition, and treatment profiles of mMAG-1 are retained by cMAG-1; (iii) modeling a humanized form (hMAG-1) of MAG-1 from the cMAG-1 with genetically grafting CDRs from the VH and VL regions of mMAG-1 into the DNA framework of a human antibody; (iv) establishing that the targeting, recognition, and treatment profiles of mMAG-1 are retained by hMAG-1. These investigations will employ, RT-PCR, ligation, and cloning, DNA recombinance, DNA sequencing, immunohistochemistry, antibody modification, Northern and Western analysis with densiometric quantitation, ELISA, RIA, tumor-directed targeting, whole-body scintigraphy for 99mTechnetium, cytofluorographic and radiometric quantitation, radioligand binding, flow cytometry, CDC assay, ADCC assay, TUNEL assay, and cell and tumor growth assessments in nu/nu mice. A successful end-point of our Phase 2 studies would be the generation of cMAG-1and/or hMAG-1 forms of our antibody that show a similar binding affinity as mMAG-1, recognize all or most breast cancers, do not react with normal tissues, can reduce the size of tumors, and/or prevent their growth in vivo. The proposed research is expected to rapidly lead to new and successful therapeutic approaches for managing breast cancer. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: With 217,440 new breast cancer patients per year, the identification of a novel cancer marker affords a unique opportunity to develop both diagnostic and therapeutic products to treat this disease. The proposed research is expected to lead to new and successful therapeutic approaches for managing breast cancer, thereby leading to a higher survival rate of the patients.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will put into service a prototype/pilot facility to assess the technical and commercial feasibility of unambiguously sorting small chips of super-alloys at high speeds. Spectramet Technology is a platform optoelectronic manufacturing technology for analyzing metals and alloys at previously unachievable accuracy and high speeds into known alloys to meet smelter specifications. The technology platform is not only aimed at sorting alloys into base metal groups, but can also sort the alloys by alloy type. One part of the Spectramet Technology focuses on sorting valuable super-alloys such as nickel-, cobalt-, and titanium based metals. This proposal is aims at extending the existing technology with an entirely new innovative sensor approach to process particles one-thousandth the size of prior applications and to identifying and sorting those particles at speeds thousands of times faster than has ever been done before.  The broader impact/commercial potential from this technology will be reducing the amount of strategic super-alloy metal that is downgraded to inferior product uses and applications in the U.S. so that this very valuable scrap metal can be recycled into its highest value application, so it can be used again as super-alloy feedstock for making new super-alloy parts. The result of recycling this material rather than downgrading it to lower value applications will be reduced U.S. dependence on supplies of strategic virgin metals recovered at primary refineries from ore (most of which are purchased abroad), substantial energy savings from use of scrap rather than ore and virgin materials, and greatly reduced emissions because secondary smelting consumes much less energy than primary production.",

        "abstract": "Studies of exotic nuclei, performed at DOE accelerator facilities, use a variety of radiation detectors to measure the  properties of these nuclei.  Some of these accelerators are being upgraded to reach higher energies and generate better yields of highly unstable nuclei with shorter lifetimes.  At the same time, detectors are being improved to generate faster signals that can provide higher count rates and better position, time, and/or energy resolution.  To match these improvements, high-speed digital detector readout electronics will be needed.  This project will involve the redesign of digital readout electronics, developed previously for radiation detectors, to achieve digitization of a detector signal up to 500 MHz and 12 bit precision, while still providing full spectrometer functions.  In Phase I, field programmable gate arrays were evaluated for the feasibility of fast data capture; an existing electronics module was updated with a 500MHz, 12 bit analog-to-digital converter; and firmware for fast waveform capture was developed.  The preliminary evaluation demonstrated that capture and on-board processing of fast waveforms at 500 MHz is feasible.  In Phase II, the test hardware will be upgraded to a commercial prototype, a faster readout will be added, and throughput will be increased with a fast-floating-point digital signal processor. Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  When applied to the studies of exotic nuclei, the proposed instrument will help in the attempt to answer important questions related to the fundamental physics beyond the Standard Model of Weak Interactions.  In other scientific applications, the instrument could improve the quality and amount of data obtained from fast detectors.  Practical applications include gamma/neutron pulse-shape discrimination in the signals of fast liquid scintillators, which is increasingly used in cargo imaging applications for homeland security",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every year, diseases of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract account for more than 30 million office visits in the United States alone. GI tract disorders are easy to cure in their early stages but are difficult to diagnose. Common exam procedures, such as endoscopy, are often not adequate and reliable. Supposedly, endoscopy is to exam the walls of the digestive tract. However, existing endoscopes are design to have a limited forward-looking field-of-view (FOV). Even with a side window to view a portion of GI tract walls, a 360  panoramic view cannot be obtained simultaneously. Subsequently, limited FOV and lack of ability to see 360  surrounding areas may lead to significant discomfort or potential damage to patients due to the need for turning entire endoscope to  look around , and lead to undesirable consequence of missing potential sites of disorders, e.g. hiatal hernia, gastritis, ulcers, polyps, stomach/colon cancer. This SBIR project develops a novel 360  capsule camera, dubbed the Neo360 CapsuleTM, which provides a simultaneous panoramic 360  field of view (FOV) using optical unwrapping, instead of digital unwrapping. Xigen's proprietary Neo360 imaging technology can provide 70% more image resolution than conventional endoscopes, and employs no moving parts. Not only can it acquire 360  video of interior walls of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, but also such 360  video images can be viewed directly, for the first time, without need of external computational hardware/software for unwrapping. The proposed Neo360 Capsule would provide endoscopists with greatly enhanced imaging performance that could eliminate certain miss-diagnosis of disease during GI exams. The directly viewable 360  video would also enhance visualization and communication in clinical practice. Xigen LLC has successfully completed a Phase I investigation on the Neo360 CapsuleTM design and demonstrated convincingly the feasibility of this novel imaging technology via theoretical analysis, software development, simulation validation, CAD design, prototype fabrication, and bench-top experiments. Phase II program will design and build a functional prototype of the Neo360 CapsuleTM, test the prototype by technologist and clinicians, and pursue various commercial applications. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed Neo360 CapsuleTM concept blazes an entirely new trail in the 360  imaging technology field. It will greatly increase the efficiency, accuracy, and patient's comfort in GI tract diagnosis and treatment. It will also provide a unique tool for documentation, surgery planning, and training. Due to its simple structural and optical design, the Neo360 CapsuleTM can be manufactured at low cost with high reliability for practical field use environment. The Neo360 imaging technology developed under this SBIR program is a  platform technology  with widespread commercial potential. As a breakthrough imaging technology, it will lead many researchers and practitioners to rethink the way video images are captured and spawn commercial ventures to bring it to clinical markets. In addition to many medical diagnostic instrument applications, e.g, endoscopes, gastroscope, cystoscope, colonscope, etc., the Neo360 imaging technology will lead to commercial applications in many other areas, such as pipe inspection, turbine engine diagnosis, video surveillance, automotive safety devices, navigation, security, mobile robotics, video conferencing, and internet webcast. Xigen has an integrated product development and market entry strategy.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The mission of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is  science in pursuit of fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to extend healthy life and reduce the burdens of illness and disability.  Pursuant to that mission, the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) released the RFP topic stating their objective and mission that  human health and human disease result from three interactive elements: environmental exposure, genetic susceptibility, and age. The mission of NIEHS is to reduce the burden of human disease and dysfunction from environmental causes by understanding each of these components and how they interrelate.  The proposed project from X-ray Optical Systems (XOS) will make a significant contribution for both the NIH and NIEHS Missions, as well as meet the needs of the NIEHS research objective. This project involves development and application of a low-power, compact, reliable, easy-to-operate instrument for measurement of trace elements in any liquid, gel, or solid that can be homogenized. This enables an individual environmental exposure assessment. In the home, place of employment, and recreational settings, it can be used for patients undergoing study and treatment for major diseases or for individual and occupational health risk assessment. Abnormal levels of bio-essential metals (iron, copper, and zinc) as well as toxic trace elements (mercury, lead, cadmium, and arsenic) are known to be associated with many health disorders such as cancer, cognitive impairment, and neurological diseases. The presence of metals is well-known in most neurodegenerative pathologies, such as excess serum copper or brain iron accumulation, which are associated with Wilson's, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's disease. In spite of their recognized importance, personal exposure to these metals is not routinely measured or monitored in materials in the patient's personal environment. This is due in large part to the difficulty and expense of these metal measurements in the field or clinic. The proposed analyzer is based on new, powerful, proprietary, monochromatic doubly curved crystal (DCC) X-ray optics technology that greatly increases the efficiency and sensitivity for elemental analysis. This new analyzer has the potential to offer an inexpensive, portable, robust, and safe elemental analyzer for measurements taken on-site, with little or no sample preparation. Furthermore, this will reduce costs for large scale studies such as the Genes, Environment and Health Initiative (GEI) and the National Children's Study (NCS). The proposed analyzer will facilitate much needed links between genetics and exposure research leading to improvements in quality of life while reducing healthcare costs related to a variety of chronic conditions.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project is part of a major effort by the Department of Health and Human Services (DHSS), in particular, the Genes, Environment and Health Initiative (GEI), to determine the origin of major diseases. This proposed project will develop a portable personal environmental analyzer that will measure, in the home or workplace, the elemental composition of virtually every substance with which a subject/patient comes into contact, including: food stuffs, medicines, spices, condiments, liquids (water, wine, coffee beer, tea) and all materials placed on the subject/patient's skin such as: lotions, perfumes, cosmetics (lipstick, makeup), soaps, shampoos, deodorant, etc. which can then be correlated with conditions and diseases of the subject/patient. Other applications for this technology are expected to be part of the GEI, the National Children's Study (NCS), in workplace assessments of occupational exposure, hospitals, or other medical or research settings.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on the development of a novel system for communication with computer through touch, particularly relevant to blind individuals. The system includes a newly developed Tactile Display Device (TDD) technology with miniature thermo-fluidic actuators that uniquely revolutionizes the way humans interact with different machines and systems using a wearable tactile display. The proposed new technology is a significant breakthrough as the concept of sensing touch actuation based on bubble formation and vapor pressure has a wide potential for miniaturization, embedding, flexibility, and wearable possibilities with amplitude and force of actuation not achieved by other means so far. The specific objectives of the project are to improve the actuator modules and the TDD developed during Phase I of the project, so that the technology can be brought to market.  The research will impact both the education and scientific segments of the market by addressing many challenges in application of bubble and vapor based motive power in miniature systems. Additionally, this outcomes of this work is expected to catalyze new avenues and variants discovered by the scientific community working in the areas of miniature actuators and systems, eventually leading to new innovations in Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) and in nanosystems. The research has very high societal impact potential as it addresses the blind population\nmarket segment that is somewhat neglected by the larger corporations due to its relatively smaller size. The blind population is not benefiting fully by the latest trend in information decimation increasingly through internet and computer based mediums. As these medium are highly graphic and visual in nature, alternate and enhanced interfaces with computers that use touch to convey information will be of great service and importance in making the visually impaired population more informed and productive.",

        "abstract": "The High Energy Physics community has used the Andrew File System (AFS) for the last fifteen years in order to provide collaborative data access that collectively reaches petabyte scale.  Transitioning to alternative file systems has proven difficult due to the number of deployed clients, the quantity of stored data, and dependencies on functional behaviors unique to AFS.  AFS protocols no longer can provide acceptable scalability or throughput performance at the speed of current day networks and CPUs.  As a result, a need exists for a new global file system that is backward-compatible with AFS and provides the scalability, throughput, and client-operating-system compatibility required to satisfy the needs of applications throughout the next decade.  This project will improve upon the scalability and performance of AFS, while providing backward-compatibility with existing clients and permitting a smooth server transition.  During Phase I, feasibility was demonstrated by improving the performance of the existing OpenAFS Rx/UDP protocol implementation.  Phase II will focus on improving Rx/UDP retransmission algorithms, optimizing data structures and algorithms, and providing an improved user experience. Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  In addition to the application to DOE laboratories that use AFS, the technology should benefit private companies in the financial, manufacturing, and service industries.  Beyond that, it is believed that the next generation of mobile devices, such as the Nokia N-series Internet Tablet and the Google Android cell phone, could take advantage of a secure global-access data storehouse, preventing the need to copy data onto each and every device and flash disk.",

This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project seeks to prototype/validate a novel, self-regulating blade for a 3-kW Residential Wind Turbine (RWT). Successful development of this next-generation blade will eliminate major technical/economic drawbacks and reliability issues with current RWT's, and will promote widespread national and international commercial deployment of wind turbines. This project will demonstrate the following: 1) low-cost, durable, impact-resistant, mass-producible (and recyclable) blades; 2) self-regulation in high-winds and load mitigation in turbulence (allowing for reduced blade mass and cost); and 3) a simpler, more-reliable downwind turbine, for which the blades themselves protect the RWT in high winds and the cost and complexity of the tail and furling mechanism are eliminated.  The broader impact/commercial potential of this project enables the nation to meet or exceed ambitious industry projections, which state that 3% of U.S. electricity could be supplied by RWT's operated by a significant share of the 15 million households that have suitable land/wind resources. The timing for the breakthroughs being pursued by this project is ideal, as incentives similar to those offered for residential solar installations are being offered for RWTs. By substantially reducing the final market barriers of high cost and low reliability, this project will have a significant market advantage and will produce a next-generation wind-power technology that will allow individual households to make significant contributions to national energy independence and security.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mesothelial cells have been found to be pivotal in tumor metastasis, peritoneal dialysis, and inflammatory response. These cells are specialized epithelial cells that line the peritoneal, pericardial, and pleural cavities and internal organs presenting a barrier to invading organisms and physical damage. Ovarian tumor attachments occur through cancer cells binding to mesothelial cells and migrating into the surrounding tissue and vasculature. Peritoneal dialysis relies on the intact transport function of mesothelial cells to allow transfer of waste products from the underlying vasculature to the dialysis fluid in the peritoneal cavity. Host response to peritoneal infection is mediated by the inflammatory cascade initiated and cytokines release by peritoneal mesothelial cells. Research into the biology of mesothelial cells continues with the goal of developing methods to provide more effective treatments for disease. Currently, there are no commercial sources of these cells in the U.S. which requires researchers to isolate and characterize the cells on their own. This process is time consuming, requires access to human tissue, and introduces variation in the preparation and quality of the cells. Zen-Bio will address this need by providing a well characterized mesothelial cell culture system to the research community. Phase I of this project focused solely on generating an optimized primary human mesothelial cell system. Isolation and propagation optimization was achieved by systematically modifying aspects of existing protocols to enhance viable cell yields while minimizing population doublings. The ultimate goal of this proposed Phase II application is to further the commercial development to produce a fully validated, commercially available human mesothelial cell system. In addition, we will develop a suite of mesothelial cell-based assays that are applicable to several therapeutic areas. Aim I is to analyze the cytokine and gene expression changes during mesothelial cell transdifferentiation (epithelial to mesenchymal transition). Aim II is to establish mesothelial cell contract services at Zen-Bio. These services include analysis of cytokine secretion, gene expression, tumor cell-mesothelial cell interaction, and cytotoxicity. Multiple product offerings are expected from this proposal: a primary human mesothelial cell system, support media and reagents, contract assay services, and kits for mesothelial cell research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: At the completion of this project, a commercially available, fully characterized primary human mesothelial cell system and support reagents will be offered to researchers. The accessibility of this currently unavailable system will provide wider opportunity to investigate novel methods to inhibit ovarian tumor attachment, prolong the utility of peritoneal dialysis, and treat peritonitis.",

As mobile devices become more powerful and ubiquitous, text entry remains a major bottleneck to the wider adoption of mobile computing. To address this urgent need in lack of an acceptable solution, this TFI technology enables high-speed input in mobile devices and gaming applications using conventional typing techniques and keyboard layouts. In addition to demonstrating the feasibility of TFI during Phase I, the project will develop an IP strategy and a set of tools essential to future research and development. To date, one prototype has been implemented and a license agreement to commercialize some portion of the TFI technology was reached with an external partner. Completion of the Phase II research in two years will pave the way for commercialization of this innovative technology as we transition toward mobile computing. The technology developed could potentially impact a broad range of application\nareas, including mobile computing, gaming, military, and mobile security.  Mobile devices are becoming more powerful and ubiquitous. According to the IDC, convergent mobile devices grew 51% in 2007, and will grow from 124 million to 376 million in 2012.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this proposal is to create a robust one pot, in vitro, multi-gram scale synthesis of activated sugars for drug discovery and biochemical research purposes. Natural product glycosylation is vital for the discovery of new pharmaceutical compounds. While it has been recognized for some time that many biologically active natural products owe much of their therapeutic properties to their glycosylation diversity, methods for creating further diversity for drug discovery have been difficult to develop. One of the challenges is that the modified and rare sugars needed for creating diversity are unavailable or extremely difficult to make, and that the sugars need to be chemically  activated  in order to transfer them to the core natural product molecule. However, new technology has been developed where a chemoenzymatic method is used to attach sugars to natural production aglycons. With this method, a combination of a kinase and nucleotide transferase are needed to form the specific activated sugar and finally a glycosyltransferase is used to transfer the sugar to an appropriate aglycon core. This technology is valuable for drug discovery, as it can be used to produce a library of differentially glycosylated natural product molecules. The Phase II research of this project will continue the improvements in the enzymes needed for this process, including engineering a greater substrate range. The research will then focus on coupling the best enzymes, ATP/NTP regeneration, product recovery, process scale-up and creating novel antibiotic derivatives as a demonstration of the developed technology. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project is aimed toward developing a method for making a variety of activated sugars for drug discovery purposes. These sugars can used to make derivatives of natural products with new therapeutic properties, for example, antibiotics that are effective against antibiotic-resistant bacteria.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal combines the expertise of world renowned medical center collaborators with the experience obtained from our SBIR Phase I project to provide a 3rd generation 3D breast CT scanner suitable for a planned patient trial. X-ray mammography (XRM) has recognized limits including relatively high false negative rates. Other disadvantages include uncomfortable breast compression (possibly reducing participation rates), relatively high dose to the breast, and low positive predictive value, especially for radiographically dense breasts, and 2D images having severely overlapped tissues. The emergence of compact, high-quality digital X-ray imaging detectors, together with nearly exponential growth in computing power and corresponding price reductions, allows for the natural evolution of fully-3D dedicated breast imaging. The contemporary breast imaging approach using tomosynthesis yields morphological, pseudo-3D images (asymmetric volume image resolution with highly aliased and blurred artifacts) and with otherwise no quantifiable metrics due to the highly insufficiently sampled breast volume. The fully-3D dedicated breast Computed mammoTomography (CmT) solution we are developing has the potential for improved detection of breast lesions through the removal of contrast-reducing overlying tissue with images having lt500 micron isotropic resolution, as well as the added benefits of uncompressed breast imaging for greater patient comfort, and breast dose equal to or less than that of current dual view screening mammography. Since it is well known that breast compression affects flow of contrast agents, immobilized but uncompressed breast CmT imaging proposed here also allows for contrast enhanced and other kinetic based studies. Ultimately, we expect this technology to result in improved positive predictive value with earlier cancer detection and reduced morbidity and mortality. In NCI-funded work, all Aims have been accomplished in the Phase I SBIR, and we have confirmed that the next generation scanner will be able to fully image the breast and chest wall of a prone patient with uncompressed breasts without unnecessary and uncomfortable contortions of the patient. Our findings have indicated that a unique combination of complex motion capabilities together with modified system and bed components are required to meet this end. As far as we know, this will represent the first dedicated breast CT system with these capabilities and solves one of the major issues remaining for this technology to be commercially successful, namely the ability to image the full breast and chest wall, in a short period of time, without moving the patient during the scan, and maximizing patient comfort. Therefore, the main goals of this Phase II proposal will be to fabricate a clinic-ready scanner containing all modifications indicated in the Phase I and to perform clinical evaluations of this scanner with a small cohort of patients. These goals will be approached through the following Phase II Specific Aims over a two-year period: Specific Aim 1 is to fabricate a clinic-ready scanner using the results of the Phase I SBIR. Tasks will include: (1) implementation of new larger Varian 4030E detector and end-on Comet X-ray tube; (2) implementation of redesigned patient bed specifically adapted to the new system; and (3) implementation and automation of unique orbits and vertical motion capability of system determined in Phase I to maximize the breast volume scanned. Specific Aim 2 is to upgrade front-end and back-end software systems, including (1) implementation of improved synchronization and software robustness to FDA standards; (2) implementation of improved reconstruction algorithm for faster and more practical reconstructions; (3) implementation of front-end GUI for use by trained technician; (4) automation of back-end process for reconstructions and data presentation; and (5) inclusion of literature based scatter correction. Specific Aim 3 is to perform a limited patient trial with a cohort of 25 locally advanced breast cancer patients for three purposes: (1) evaluation of a developed simple mechanism for uncompressed breast immobilization and biopsy capability; (2) evaluation of modified system on women of varying breast and body sizes to confirm system flexibility and ability to image to chest wall; (3) comparison study of CmT versus digital x-ray mammography where patients will undergo both scans. Criteria for success for each Aim are defined in the more detailed Specific Aims section of the proposal. Therefore, the primary goal of this proposal is to produce a clinic-ready and saleable next generation system suitable for placement in practicing clinics to be used for collection of clinical trial results suitable for FDA submission and subsequent sale of systems for commercial use. These systems will be, to our knowledge, the only dedicated breast CT systems with the complex motion capabilities necessary for comfortable and complete breast, and also capable of chest wall imaging. Overall success of this project will be indicated by a complete system useable by trained technicians in a clinical setting and the indication from initial patient trials that the system measures up to the anticipated advantages that have been indicated by our previous results. Phase III is anticipated to involve production of several commercially viable products for placement in several clinics for larger patient trials. The sampling techniques developed here could also be packaged as products in their own right. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This R44 proposal seeks Phase II funding to produce a clinic-ready, commercially viable, next generation dedicated 3D breast CT device and conduct initial patient trials to evaluate the ability of the system to image breast cancers as compared with conventional digital mammography. In the USA, breast cancer in women is one of the leading causes of malignancy and the second leading cause of death due to cancer (after lung cancer). The earlier a lesion is detected, the better the chances for survival. Our primary hypothesis has been that a dedicated device for 3-dimensional, uncompressed, whole breast imaging will significantly improve cancer detection, thereby reducing morbidity and mortality. Preliminary results have indicated a significant potential advantage and therefore indicate that 3D breast CT should play a prominent role as an important tool in a clinical setting for mammographers. This project serves to provide a clinic-ready scanner able to comfortably image the entire breast without breast compression along with the chest wall of a prone patient, overcoming a major challenge for dedicated breast imaging, and to provide initial patient results confirming patient benefits and therefore commercial potential. Subsequent Phase III activities will involve production of several systems for placement in multiple clinics and conduction of further clinical trials for FDA approval. Academic research markets will also be approached for sale of additional units.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current generation Adenovirus (Ad) vector vaccines deleted at the E1 or the E1, E3 regions have resulted in experimental potential to immunize against a variety of infectious diseases such as HIV. These Ad vectors permit the delivery of genes, which express proteins that stimulate the immune system. An advanced generation of Ad vectors with unique deletions of the E1 and E2b region (E2b encodes the viral DNA polymerase (pol) and the preterminal protein (pTP) has previously been described. The deletion of these genetic regions renders the Ad5 [E1-, E2b-] virus completely replication incompetent. The new human Ad5 [ E1-,E2b-] vectors have several advantages. Ad viral DNA replication is significantly diminished and the removal of the E2b region results in a 10,000-fold reduction in the production of Ad late gene products, further reducing the potential of Ad encoded viral proteins from impacting host immune responses. Moreover, use of Ad5 [E1-, E2b-]  vectors have been shown to have decreased cytotoxicity. The Ad5 [E1-, E2b-] vectors can also lead to an increased quantity and sustained expression of inserted transgenes. These characteristics of Ad5 [E1-, E2b] vectors suggest that they are superior to Ad5 [ El-] vectors. In light of these advantages, our strategy is to employ the use of Ad5 [E1-, E2b-] vectors as a new platform for vaccine based vectors. Specifically, we chose to use this new Ad5 platform as a vaccine platform for HIV-1.     Our Phase 1 goal to investigate Ad5 [E1-, E2b-] vectors was very successful. Multiple immunizations induced robust immunologic responses to transgene products. We observed that animals could be immunized with one antigen and then subsequently immunized with a second differing antigen in the presence of Ad5 immunity. In comparison with the current generation Ad5 [E1-] vector, our [E1-, E2b-] vector induced higher levels of interferon-? and lL-2 secreting lymphocytes both in Ad5 naive and Ad5 immune. Studies also demonstrate that animals could be immunized with a triad mixture of Ad5 [E1-, E2b-] gag, nef, pol. Our analysis of samples from our initial vaccine trial in NHPs suggest that they can be successfully immunized against the HIV gag protein in the presence of pre-existing Ad5 hyper immunity.     In Phase II, studies will be performed in mice and NHPs to further develop the vaccination regimen. The Aims of the Phase II study are to (1) prepare SIV and human Ad5 [E1-, E2b-]-gag, pol, nef vaccine platforms. (2) determine the optimal frequency and optimal route of triad vaccination in mice by investigating immunizations on a weekly, bi-weekly and monthly schedule and also compare intradermal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal and intravenous routes of immunization with a triad mix of Ad5 [E1-, E2b-]-gag/pol/nef vectors. (3) determine the duration of transgene expression in vivo. (4) test safety and immunogenicity of the triad vaccine in Ad5 na ve and Ad5 immune NHP, and (5) perform SIV challenge studies of vaccinated NHPs. Etubics will perform these pre-clinical studies to advance this new vaccine platform into clinical trials. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: With approximately 5,000 new HIV-1 infections occurring daily and the failure of the Merck 'STEP  HIV vaccine trial, the need for a viable HIV-1 vaccine is urgent. During this study, we will further develop our advanced adenoviral vector delivery system for HIV vaccines. The system is needed to break through the barrier presented by vaccinees who have had prior adenovirus infections which includes many humans worldwide.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The objective of this project is to continue to develop an adenoviral vector vaccine against CEA that is effective in stimulating cell-mediated immune responses in subjects previously immune to Adenovirus. The Ad-CEA vaccine endpoint is to treat patients with CEA bearing cancers. CEA is a tumor associated protein that has been reported to be useful as a vaccine treatmen target. Evidence indicates that a broad cell-mediate immune (CMl) response is needed to treat certain CEA bearing tumors. Adenovirus vector vaccines induce CMI responses and have emerged as a leading candidate to be used as a treatment vaccine delivery platform. First generation Adenovirus vaccines have proven less effective than anticipated and adverse reactions are in question. Furthermore pre-existing Adenovirus immunity of most humans causes decreased effectiveness. To address these issues, we have developed an advanced Adenovirus based vector that is devoid of early genes E1, E3,and E2b. These  E2b  deleted vectors, with deletions in the polymerase and preterminal protein genes, have an expanded cloning capacity and greatly reduced expression of viral late genes as compared to First Generation Adenoviral vectors. The reduced expression of multiple Adenoviral genes has been demonstrated to be advantageous for vaccine development for reasons such as reduced antigenic competition, greater longevity of expression which provides increased immunologic stimulus and reduced adverse effects. Such advantage are important in the presence of pre-existing Adenoviral immunity, and provide the E2b Adenoviral vectors with stealth like attributes. The Company has exclusive license for the new Adenoviral vector system and the E.C7 cell line that supports vector production. The proposed studies are designed to construct and further test the effectiveness of a CEA vaccine based on this new Adenoviral vector platform which will carry the CEA gene. Our Phase I studies tested this new vaccine for the potential to induce CEA memory CMI response as a prime and re-immunization (boost) potential in Ad-na ve and Ad-immune mice. Based upon our successful results observed in the Phase I studies, we propose to conduct human clinical Phase l/ll trials in our current project proposal.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This study will further develop pre-clinical information and lead to clinical trials of a new drug (Ads [E1-, E2b-]-CEA) to treat cancers which have carcinoembryonic antigen on their surface.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many recent studies have demonstrated the efficacy of interstitial ablative approaches for the treatment of hepatic tumors, including chemical ablation, cryoablation, and thermal ablation using energy sources like RF, laser, microwave, or focused ultrasound. Despite these promising results, current systems remain highly dependent on operator skill, and cannot treat many tumors because there is little control of the size and shape of the zone of necrosis, and no control over ablator trajectory within tissue. Remedying this problem requires advances in end-effector design, precise steering of the ablator device to the desired target location, and real- time monitoring of the zone of necrosis to ensure complete treatment. Intra-procedure ultrasound imaging provides perhaps the optimal and most readily available method for targeting, but simultaneous manual handling of the B-mode ultrasound (US) probe and the ablator device is a challenging task that is prone to significant errors in the hands of even the most experienced physicians. Tissue deformation and target motion make it extremely difficult to place the ablator device precisely into the target. Irregularly shaped target volumes typically require multiple insertions and several overlapping thermal lesions, which are even more challenging to accomplish in a precise and timely manner without causing excessive damage to surrounding normal tissues. In answer to these problems, we propose to develop an innovative method for accurate tracking and tool registration with respect to spatially-registered intaoperative US volumes without relying on an external tracking device. This three-dimensional ultrasound (3DUS) will be integrated with a flexible, snake-like lightweight and inexpensive robotic, called the Active Cannula (AC), to facilitate precise placement of a steerable ultrasound thermal ablator into the liver and to monitor the progress of tissue ablation with real-time 3D registered ultrasound. Recent developments of implantable or interstitial high-power ultrasound applicators have demonstrated extremely controllable and penetrating heating patterns which can be shaped and dynamically altered, providing an ideal mechanism for conformable thermal surgery. This controllability and penetration is highly desirable and would provide significant improvement over existing RF and microwave (MW) technology used for minimally invasive thermal ablation of liver tumors. However, to date the extensive evaluation of this minimally invasive technology has been limited mostly to in vivo canine prostates and moderately perfused tissues, and have not included the design iterations and thorough evaluations necessary for treating tumors within highly perfused liver tissue. The preliminary thermal data from thermal therapy of perfused liver (Section C) are encouraging. Ultrasound Interstitial Thermal Therapy (USITT) technology is promising and we will extend the technology to optimize its use for the treatment of hepatic tumors. The overall goal of this research and development is to provide a true closed-loop system for steering, placement, guidance, percutaneous delivery of conformal ablative therapy, and on-line monitoring of treatment.",

        "abstract": "The cost of electricity for small wind turbines is too high, and the installation process is too cumbersome, to achieve the widespread deployment goals of industry stakeholders.  Guyed towers, which are traditionally the least expensive to erect, represent one approach to cost savings, but these systems have a larger footprint, require more maintenance, and are less visually appealing than the monopole towers preferred by many customers.  Therefore, this project will develop technology to address the construction of the logistically cumbersome and cost inefficient monopole tower systems (foundations plus towers).  For the foundation, dramatic simplification is achieved by inexpensively shipping all required foundation materials (except concrete) directly to the installer.  The tower, which will be composed of a hybrid metal-fiberglass, will weigh about half as much as steel towers, will be inexpensive to ship, and will be much less costly than traditional monopole alternatives.  In Phase I, 402 foundations were installed in 36 states and 9 off-shore locations.  Both the towers and foundations were evaluated and approved by tower engineering professionals.  Phase II will involve conducting field tests, developing improved components, optimizing the designs, and testing the system at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The proposed tower system should be suitable for use on all small wind turbines employing free-standing towers.  With this system, a typical turbine on an 18.3 m (60 ft) tower would have an installed cost saving of approximately 30%.  The technology would thus be a tool for promoting the expansion of wind turbines in the U.S",

        "abstract": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).  This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to develop an analysis method based on plasma physics with unique advantages for in situ process control in coal-fired power plants and in metal and glass production. Software developed from this program will result in development of process control sensors capable of rapidly measuring the elemental composition of a material solely from the material's analytical laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) spectrum. Analyses without calibration curves or standard reference materials (SRM's) would be revolutionary because conditions change and material compositions vary outside their expected range in industrial plants, rendering calibration curves inaccurate. Analytical LIBS could not be developed in the past because of these large uncertainties. This project will verify the algorithms developed are effective when applied to actual industrial materials: coal, aluminum, and glass. Coupling Analytical LIBS with a LIBS sensor for coal and patented LIBS probe for molten metals and glass will result in real time monitoring and control, a new and potentially paradigm shifting capability for these industries.  The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be to the coal-fired power plants and manufacturing plants that produce glass, metal alloys, and other products by allowing the plant personnel to monitor the\ncomposition of their material continuously, which is currently impossible. Alloying and other mixing operations will be monitored in real time, eliminating errors in these operations. Increased plant output, reduced waste, and reduced energy expenditures per pound of product will result from problems in the production process being caught much more quickly. New manufacturing paradigms, such as continuous alloying of aluminum, are also made possible by development of this technology. Developing Analytical LIBS for the measurement of coal properties at electric utility power plants will increase their efficiency and optimize boiler performance. There will also be benefits in other fields such as atomic emission spectroscopy, plasma physics, and astronomy. Analytical LIBS can also be extended for accurate LIBS analyses of the environment (e.g. minerals, oceans, atmospheric aerosols), planetary science (e.g. Mars, moon, and comets), agriculture, and security (e.g. WMD detection). The development of Analytical LIBS for these fields is crucial because no standard reference materials (SRM's) exist for many of these materials, and hence accurate calibration curves are difficult to construct and will have limited utility.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Building on the accomplishments of the prior Phase I and Phase II NIH SBIR grants in which Infoscitex was the lead institution and MIT was the subcontractor, in this Phase II competitive renewal grant application we propose to develop a commercial quality catheter guidance system that will allow clinicians to treat ventricular tachycardia (VT) with radio frequency (RF) ablation. This system features an innovative single equivalent moving dipole (SEMD) inverse algorithm that reduces the total time required to locate the site of arrhythmia, precisely position an RF ablation catheter, and only requires that the patient be maintained in the arrhythmia for a few beats. During the first two years the team at Infoscitex will design and construct the commercial quality catheter guidance system while Professor Cohen at MIT will conduct animal studies using the prototype catheter guidance system developed during Phase II in order to refine the algorithms and procedures for using this system and to test the efficacy of the system in animal models of VT. During year 3 of this project, Dr. Cohen at MIT will test the commercial quality system in animal models of VT and the engineering team at Infoscitex will implement any modifications dictated by the animal testing. In addition, during the Phase II competitive renewal, we will take the steps needed to prepare for the successful commercialization of this technology either by spinning out a startup company or through licensure of the technology to an established company. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Ischemic heart disease is perhaps the most common pathophysiologic substrate for the development of ventricular tachycardia (VT). VT also occurs in a wide variety of different types of structural heart disease including non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, valvular disease, congenital heart disease, and primary electrophysiological abnormalities such as Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome [3]. However, it is estimated that 80% of sudden cardiac deaths attributed to arrhythmias occur in patients with a prior myocardial infarction (MI). The electrical properties of infarcted tissue can cause formation of a reentrant circuit and precipitation of a lethal VT. These regions can also become points of abnormal initiation of impulse activity. Transient myocardial ischemia, perhaps caused by coronary spasm or unstable platelet thrombi, can lead to death via the same mechanisms. This research is aimed at the development of a commercial quality catheter guidance system that will facilitate clinicians in treating VT with radio frequency (RF) ablation. This system features an innovative single equivalent moving dipole (SEMD) inverse algorithm that reduces the total time required to locate the site of arrhythmia, precisely position an RF ablation catheter, and only requires that the patient be maintained in the arrhythmia for a few beats. This clinical system will ultimately permit RF ablation to become an effective and efficient tool for treating a wide variety of VT, reducing mortality and morbidity from this prevalent clinical problem.",

        "abstract": "Energy security and global warming are looming issues for the future of our nation\u00c2\u00bfs vitality, productivity, and environmental health.  The notion of a hydrogen-fueled future is positive on many levels, including air quality and efficiency, but its realization depends critically on the identification of a carbon-free, or at least renewable, energy source.  Thermochemical cycles, such as the Hybrid Sulfur (HyS) process, have the potential of providing hydrogen from nuclear energy at high efficiency and with minimal environmental impact.  This project will develop an innovative electrolyzer design for the HyS proton-exchange membrane (PEM) to correct the SO2 crossover problem inherent in current state-of-the-art HyS electrolyzers.  In Phase I, anode technologies were developed to minimize SO2 crossover, which was reduced by 70% (exceeding the 50% reduction target) while maintaining high electro-chemical performance.  Phase II will (1) refine the novel anode technology and develop PEM improvements; (2) conduct an analysis and modeling of the sulfur generation chemistry of the cathode; and (3) design, fabricate, and demonstrate a scaled-up (1.6 lbs H2/day) HyS electrolyzer stack incorporating the Phase I anode. Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The technology should enable the use of thinner PEMs in future HyS electrolyzers and extend operating lifetimes due to reduced sulfur layer buildup, which should significantly increase the total efficiency and operating costs of the HyS thermochemical cycle",

It is a safe procedure, but complications do occur. Many new IOLs are being designed to further improve vision after cataract surgery; however, concerns exist regarding both the safety and effectiveness of these new designs. Magnetic resonance imaging has the unique ability to fully show the IOL position in the intact eye thus providing information to permit better and safer IOLs and other ocular implants and procedures to be designed. Presbyopia is the loss of accommodation with age and industry efforts to provide surgical correction for presbyopia are vigorously underway as the potential market for such a product is substantial. Strategies include lens refilling, scleral treatments, and, most notably, the development of accommodating intraocular lenses (A-IOLs). However, despite this renewed interest in IOLs for the correction of presbyopia (as well as myopia, hyperopia, and astigmatism), many questions remain regarding the: optic and haptic sizing and post-operative positional stability, development of Soemmering's ring and posterior capsule opacification (PCO), power calculations, and adverse effects of these and even established IOL designs. The high-resolution MRI techniques developed by the Principal Investigator are not hampered by the iris and are thus able to provide non-invasive visualization of the entire IOL (optic and haptics) and fully characterize its geometric relationship to surrounding intraocular structures both during accommodation and with accommodation at rest; this information cannot be obtained from the intact eye by any other method. The ultimate goal of this project is to produce a biometric database of the unique information obtained from MRI images of the pseudophakic eye in order to fully characterize IOL placement in the anterior segment. Moreover, posterior capsule opacification is a common complication of cataract surgery that decreases visual acuity, has been correlated with IOL tilt and decentration, and is of particular concern with new IOL designs. Soemmering's ring, develops after virtually every IOL implantation, is a direct precursor to PCO, is associated with other complications including pupillary block glaucoma, and our MRI data suggest that it is also closely associated with IOL malposition. We plan to non-invasively grade Soemmering's ring in vivo with MRI and correlate Soemmering's ring development with anterior segment biometry and IOL type, position, tilt, decentration, and accommodative behavior. Successful completion of this project will facilitate the construction of models that allow better traditional, phakic, and accommodating IOL designs as well as other methods of presbyopia correction to be simulated and developed. Moreover, it will facilitate the construction of refined algorithms for preoperative IOL power calculations and improve our understanding of post-operative complications of IOL surgery. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cataract surgery is the most common surgery in the world and its frequency will increase as the population ages. In this surgery, the human lens is removed and replaced with an intraocular lens (IOL). It is a safe procedure, but complications do occur and vision after surgery is not always optimal. Many new IOLs are being designed to further improve vision after cataract surgery; however, concerns exist regarding both the safety and effectiveness of these new designs. Magnetic resonance imaging has the unique ability to fully show the IOL location inside eye and how this changes depending upon whether one is looking far or near. Thus measurements will be made to better understand IOL location inside the eye and the complications that can occur with cataract surgery.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ABSTRACT: This application is a Phase I/Phase II Fast-Track SBIR application. Osteoarthritis (OA), the clinical syndrome of joint pain and dysfunction caused by joint degeneration, affects more people than any other joint disease. There are no consistently effective methods for preventing OA or slowing its progression, and so symptomatic treatments represent the standard of care, the foundation of which are the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Such treatments for OA require consideration of not only gastrointestinal (GI) risk, but also cardiovascular (CV) risk; non-selective NSAIDs acting on both cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and COX-2 universally increase the risk of GI injury, whereas nearly all NSAIDs, especially the selective COX-2 inhibitors, have been shown to increase the risk of serious CV events. The withdrawal of rofecoxib and valdecoxib from the market amplify the continuing need for an NSAID with minimal CV and GI risks. Naproxen has become the NSAID of choice for most mild/moderate chronic inflammatory indications, including OA, as it appears to have little or no increased risk of cardiovascular adverse events. However, in spite of its favorable CV safety profile, naproxen is well known to induce GI toxicity that is sometimes life-threatening. The activities proposed in this grant application are intended to advance a new naproxen formulation (Naproxen-PC) that not only improves the GI safety of naproxen using a non-COX mechanism, but also may enhance anti-inflammatory activity compared with naproxen. Naproxen-PC improves GI safety by increasing the lipophilicity of the NSAID via non- covalent pre-association with a surface-active phospholipid, namely phosphatidylcholine (PC). This oil-based formulation of PC-associated naproxen (Naproxen-PC) has been shown in rodent models to have remarkably lower (~85%) GI toxicity, while retaining the efficacy and general safety profile of unmodified naproxen. Recently, novel methods have been developed to profile bioactive lipids in a model of joint inflammation, including products of both cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase (LOX). Preliminary data assaying a range of bioactive lipids suggests that Naproxen-PC may have enhanced anti-inflammatory efficacy, as reflected in the attenuation of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids (including prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), leukotriene B4 (LTB4), 12- hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE), and 5-HETE), while sparing anti-inflammatory eicosanoids (13- hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (13-HODE)), compared with unmodified naproxen, in a rodent model of joint inflammation. The major objective of this Fast-Track SBIR application is to confirm the preliminary data described above and continue and expand the development of Naproxen-PC and initiate clinical studies. In Phase I, initial activities will focus on expanding and confirming the enhanced anti-inflammatory activity of Naproxen-PC seen in animal models. Also, in partnership with a commercial manufacturer, we propose to optimize the laboratory formulation of Naproxen-PC so that it may be softgel encapsulated and manufactured for clinical trials. Several lead prototypes resulting from this optimization will be identified that appear commercially viable, which will be tested in established animal models with both GI safety and analgesic and anti-inflammatory efficacy endpoints. The results of these experiments will allow selection of a single, validated lead Naproxen-PC formulation. In Phase II, the lead formulation will be manufactured as 250 mg Naproxen-PC gelcaps according to regulatory standards, further tested for stability, then advanced into clinical trials. Initially, a single-dose bioequivalence (BE) study, comparing Naproxen-PC with unmodified naproxen, will be completed in healthy volunteers; this pharmacokinetics study will provide BE data for Naproxen-PC FDA approval via the accelerated 505(b)(2) regulatory route, and provide data on the systemic safety of Naproxen- PC. Then, a comparative proof-of-concept clinical trial will be conducted examining analgesic efficacy, general safety and the incidence of gastrointestinal ulcers, assessed endoscopically, in patients with osteoarthritis aged 55 years or older, following administration of 500 mg Naproxen-PC or naproxen BID for 12 weeks. The development activities encompassed in this grant proposal will significantly advance the Naproxen-PC development toward commercialization. If the Naproxen-PC formulation is shown in subsequent confirmatory clinical trials to possess an improved GI safety profile, together with equivalent analgesic and perhaps superior anti-inflammatory efficacy compared with naproxen, it will represent an important new treatment for patients with osteoarthritis and related chronic inflammatory diseases.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project concerns the design, development and commercialization of systems for real-time measurement and enhancement of the quality of video distributed over emerging networks. The Phase I project has demonstrated the feasibility of a real-time version of an automatic video quality meter (AVQ) that has several novel features. By not requiring a reference to the source video, and by being compute-scalable, the AVQ meter can reside anywhere in the video distribution chain. In addition, AVQ scores correlate extremely well with subjective assessments of users, making it valuable not only as an accurate measurement tool, but also as the starting point for VQ Enhancement (VQE). This Phase II work will create an industry-ready suite of AVQ products that can reside in the network (AVQ-N), home (AVQ-H) and Set Top Box (AVQ-STB). It will also create solutions for video quality enhancement (VQE) that will reside in several network points. The AVQ and VQE products will depend on several innovations in design, including the retention of performance in the leaner versions of AVQ and VQE, and portability of a core AVQ engine into multiple PC-native, board-level and chip-level platforms.  In rapidly emerging scenarios, video information is generated, gathered and distributed in real time, using a larger number of communication networks than ever before. Increasingly, users who are exposed to the notion of high-quality, high definition television will demand a high quality of video experience in all circumstances, in both fixed and mobile systems.  The solutions proposed in this research will initially help content providers, aggregators, distributors and receiver manufacturers in meeting user expectations in emerging systems for entertainment video.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the proposed research program is to design and develop a noninvasive device for accurately measuring arterial compliance. Arterial compliance has been shown to be a strong indicator of many types of vascular disease, including cardiovascular disease, peripheral vascular occlusive disease, diabetes, renal failure, and aging. However, current imaging modalities and non-invasive methods of compliance measurement are limited by poor resolution, sensitivity and robustness. The proposed arterial elasticity imaging (AEI) device overcomes these limitations, producing real-time images of local arterial strain and near-real time elastic modulus results. High precision, direct measurements of vessel tissue motion using ultrasound tissue tracking will be combined with lumen pressure equalization. Using speckle tracking techniques, sub-micron precision measurements of tissue motion will be produced with fine, sub-millimeter, spatial resolution in a localized region, allowing direct intramural strain estimation of targeted vessels. In addition, external preloading will significantly improve sensitivity over measurements at physiological pressure conditions, by increasing the strain induced by the vessel pressure pulse. By combining pulse wave velocity (PWV) measurements using speckle tracking with intramural strain estimates, the vessel elastic modulus will be reconstructed with significantly reduced error from geometrical uncertainties and boundary conditions. Real-time display of tissue strain images and tracking metrics will provide  as needed  assessment and valuable feedback information to the user. This technology will fully characterize nonlinear elastic properties in a highly localized region, and provide vascular compliance assessment over a large strain dynamic range with very high precision. The main technical challenge facing device development is providing real-time tissue tracking, which is needed for intramural strain and PWV measurement. Cross correlation based speckle tracking methods require significant computational power, historically limiting them to off-line (i.e., not real-time) processing. Pixel Velocity Incorporated has developed algorithms and methods that combined with modern multi-processing computer hardware will provide computational power and flexibility needed for real-time arterial elasticity measurements in a portable ultrasound device. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Artery hardness, or elasticity, has been shown to be a strong indicator of cardiovascular disease, peripheral vascular occlusive disease, diabetes, renal failure, and aging. The proposed imaging device will directly visualize and quantify vessel elasticity, providing diagnostic and monitoring capabilities for vascular diseases.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): LSO is generally recognized as the ideal scintillator for PET. It has high stopping power for 511 keV gamma rays, high light yield of over 30,000 photons/MeV, and rapid decay of 40 ns. It achieves high coincidence timing resolution and energy resolution. But single crystals of LSO are difficult and expensive to grow, reproducibility is poor, andthematerial is not readily available for general commercial use. In view of the many advantages of LSO, we have undertaken a new approach capable of producing LSO scintillators with properties rivaling those of the best crystals, yet remaining cost effective for fabrication in large quantities. This approach involves developing LSO detectors in the form of optical ceramics (OCs), rather than the single crystals that are now being used. Consolidation of powder into a fully dense ceramic provides many advantages over traditional single crystal growth, such as lower fabrication temperatures and simpler processing equipment. To overcome limits on transparency imposed by non-cubic crystal structure of LSO, our approach involves fabrication of ceramics with grain size limited to sub-micrometer region. Since the grain sizes now approach the wavelength of emitted light, scattering at grain boundaries is prevented and fully transparent material can be expected. The procedure has been completely confirmed in experiments on polycrystalline alumina, which is similarly anisotropic, and is being developed for optical window applications. It is the aim of this proposal to combine the two already developed technologies so as to produce LSO in the form of a fully transparent optical ceramic, which displays scintillation performance comparable to that of a single crystal. Construction of detector modules for PET imaging based on optically transparent ceramic LSO scintillators is also planned in the proposed effort. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will investigate a promising detector technology which should have a major impact in health care, in particular, in the development of low cost detectors for in-vivo medical imaging. Other areas to which this research could be of benefit are: physics research, materials studies, homeland defense, and non-destructive testing.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This SBIR Phase II project defines and implements a new class of technology-enabled science and environmental health science (EHS) grade 6-12 teacher support environment. The proposed innovation is called Teacher's iPod or TiP. The goals of the Phase II TiP study are to: (1) prepare teachers to be more effective, knowledgeable, and professional in delivering specific lessons, content, and/or activities in the classroom resulting in improved learning outcomes, (2) overcome teachers' residual resistance to adopting and effectively using new learning technologies, and (3) be of low-cost, robust, and supported with a viable commercialization plan. The need for TiP is reflected in the fact that US science education is at a crossroads. National and international assessments indicate a number of systemic weaknesses in the 6-12 science (including EHS) educational delivery system. Historically, the in-class teacher has been the primary learning enabler, but today many 6-12 science teachers have limited formal training and credentials in scientific and technical fields, especially EHS. TiP will use a recent technological innovation, called podcasting, to automatically deliver just-in-time focused instruction that prepare teachers to be more effect in-class learning agents on a lesson-by-lesson basis. TiP podcasts are designed to provide teachers with a core understanding of the topical material to be presented in-class, along with suggested lecturer enhancements, supporting activities, and recommended assessment strategies. The on-demand delivery of the TiP podcasts is automated under teacher control, and can be transacted anytime and anywhere (e.g., morning commute). The Phase II TiP study will plan, design, and implement a feature-filled collection of course-specific podcasts for multiple 6-12 science courses. TiP podcasts will be scripted to enrich the entire science learning experience with an added EHS-awareness. A rigorous assessment program will involved 120 Orange County Public School (Orlando, FL) and Leon County Schools (Tallahassee, FL) science teachers, engaging around 4,500 students. Data on TiP's efficacy, efficiency, comparability, required skill set, actual usage in authentic lesson-specific instances, and learning outcomes will be measured and analyzed. The Phase II study will result in an attractive and viable commercial product that is supported with an innovative production and marketing plan. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed TiP teacher support environment advances the cause of public health in that it can improve the quality of 6-12 science education. The project is expected to result in more enlightened graduates and an expanded the pool of those qualified to pursue public health careers.",

Tissue engineering offers the possibility of aiding regeneration of tissue damaged by disease or trauma and, in some cases, of creating new tissue and replacing failing or malfunctioning organs. It is achieved through the use of degradable biomaterials to induce surrounding tissue and cell in growth or to serve as temporary scaffolds for transplanted cells to attach, grow, and maintain differentiated functions. The role of the tissue engineering scaffold is temporary, but crucial to the success of the strategy. This proposal describes a new scaffold involving novel photoreactive nanofibers and unique immobilization of bone morphology protein-2 (BMP-2). This Phase II project is expected to develop a fully synthetic, biocompatible, biodegradable, porous and mechanically strong bone tissue engineering scaffold filled with photoreactive nanofibers ready for functionalization. Specific aims of this Phase II proposal include: 1) Determine the biocompatibility of the photoreactive nanofibers on osteoblasts; 2) Demonstrate the bioactivity of BMP-2 immobilized nanofibers on C2C12 cells; 3) Optimize the sintering process to fabricate photoreactive nanofibers into tissue engineering scaffolds; 4) Evaluate the osteoblastic differentiation of human bone marrow stromal cells on BMP-2 immobilized scaffolds; 5) Scale up and optimize electrospinning of photoreactive nanofibers.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching aim of this innovative proposal is to develop and then commercialize a non-invasive topical product which is safe and easy to administer that treats severe uveitis, including intermediate and posterior uveitis. Uveitis is the third leading cause of blindness in the United States. Heretofore, the primary treatments of intermediate and posterior uveitis are either oral medications (with significant systemic side effects) or invasive local methods, such as an intravitreal injection (IVT), periocular injection or implantation of a sustained release drug delivery device into the eye. Thus, there is a great need to develop a superior drug delivery system in terms of safety, patient acceptance and efficacy for severe uveitis. Our previous, successful SBIR phase I proposal (1 R43 EY014772-01) and subsequent studies gave us insights on the permeability of a water soluble corticosteroid to the eye globe; clearance effects of the conjunctiva and retina/choroid and the dosing requirements of dexamethasone sodium phosphate (DSP) to treat an in vivo IVT EIU rabbit model using a controlled release, passive diffusion-based methodology. The investigation of Aciont's vasoconstrictor technology, based on the principle of reducing the eye's blood flow clearance effects funded by that grant reached a successful endpoint. This proposal builds upon our prior SBIR work by advancing our technology closer toward commercialization into a viable product. The following main aims for this SBIR phase II proposal are closely related: 1) Complete Engineering of First Generation, Passive Diffusion Based Applicator/Device; 2) Complete Formulation Development for a Single Unit Dose Treatment Protocol under an Acute, Severe Uveitis Disease Condition Model; 3) Establish a Repeat Dose Treatment Protocol To Address a Chronic Uveitis Condition (i.e., Efficacy in Primate Model); and 4) Establish 28 Day Local Tolerance and Safety in a Chronic Uveitis Repeat Dose Treatment Protocol. Potentially, our approach can lead to a non-invasive delivery system that allows for a very simple treatment in the doctor's office which can be performed by a nurse or paraprofessional in a range of 5-10 minutes. Such a system has the potential to curtail a significant portion of the acute sight threatening condition of severe uveitis in a single treatment. A long term goal could be to train patients to administer our treatment system by themselves.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our phase II SBIR proposes to develop a non-invasive ocular drug delivery system allowing for a simple, timely (potentially, 5 minutes or less) application procedure in the doctor's office of a device (resembling a scleral lens) which can be performed by a nurse or paraprofessional. Such a system could curtail a significant portion of an acute sight threatening condition of severe uveitis in a single treatment.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Psoriasis is a chronic, inflammatory, hyper-proliferative skin disease that affects nearly 80 million people worldwide. During Phase 1, cells from involved psoriatic lesions were harvested, proliferated in monolayer culture, and cryopreserved. Culture conditions were identified which allowed the production of a full thickness psoriatic tissue model (PTM). The PTM had a hyperproliferative phenotype, produced cytokines known to be important in the psoriatic disease state, and expressed protein markers characteristic of psoriasis. In addition, the PTM appeared responsive to cytokine treatments known to be effective in treating psoriasis. Phase II research will expand on Phase 1 results. The full-thickness 3-dimensional PTM will be further developed by incorporating immuno-competent T cells. The tissue model will be fully characterized in terms of gene expression and cytokine release and the effect of immuno- suppressive drugs will be investigated. Finally, culture conditions will be adapted to allow production of the PTM in a high throughput screening (HTS) format that is compatible with modern HTS drug screening methods. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In order to perform relevant basic research and drug discovery experiments, it is essential to have relevant disease models. The availability of an in vitro reconstructed, immuno-competent psoriatic tissue model will fulfill the needs of pharmaceutical companies and the academic institutions working in the field of psoriasis.",

Instead of the slow serial scan used in a conventional WDS, the new system will collect and display data in a parallel fashion, thereby enabling the user to make very fast decisions about his/her samples.  The device will be a variation on the Von Hamos style x-ray spectrometer that uses (1) diffractors with a small radius of curvature and (2) new long charge couple detectors (CCDs) arranged to simultaneously collect data from a very wide spectral range.  In Phase I, the parallel data collection technique was demonstrated on a proof-of-concept system over a very narrow (300 eV) spectral interval.  Tests were conducted to demonstrate a higher resolution at this energy than for any commercially available spectrometer.  A design for a Phase II spectrometer was determined and software was written to allow a user to limit noise levels.  Phase II will involve the construction of a spectrometer that provides parallel data collection over the energy range from 2100 eV to 10,000 eV.  This system will be extensively tested on an SEM and on a small spot x-ray fluorescence (XRF) system.  The system also will be tested for its ability to produce spectral images of spots as large as 1 mm with 0.05 mm resolution.Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The new system could be combined with an existing spectrometer to produce an expanded system that covers the entire energy range from 100 eV to 10,0000 eV for use on SEMs.  In addition, the system could be used on stand-alone XRF systems for the analysis of small features, such as grains of rock, electronic circuits, and fibers.",

        "abstract": "Further development of rechargeable lithium batteries requires dramatic improvement of the ionically conducting electrolyte used in the batteries.  Most of the limitations of current lithium-ion batteries are due to restrictions imposed by the general use of organic electrolytes, either liquid or polymer, that limit energy density, long term cycle life, and the rate of charge/discharge capability of these batteries.  These limitations must be removed before lithium batteries can be viable as a high energy storage medium, such as required for electric vehicle applications.  This project will develop a novel inorganic solid state electrolyte prepared by a sol gel technique that solves the problems due to the organic electrolytes, while being cost effective and offering manufacturing scalability.  The novel electrolyte will have high lithium-ion conductivity, negligible conductivity of other ions and electrons, and stability with metallic lithium and other critical battery materials for applied voltages above 5V.  Phase I developed a novel electrolyte with all of the above characteristics.  The novel inorganic electrolyte was prepared by a sol gel technique, suggesting that manufacturing can be achieved at acceptable cost levels.  Phase II will fabricate and characterize an all-solid-state lithium battery with the novel inorganic solid electrolyte.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The ever-present gadgets of modern life remain constrained by the availability of power to quench the thirst of power hungry electronics.  In addition, the development of batteries with long cycle life and high energy and power densities is of prime importance to the development of successful electric vehicles.  The lithium battery technology developed in this project should address these needs.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Muscle atrophy (wasting), also known as myopathy, is a clinical complication of many diseases, e.g., cancer, AIDS, and diabetes, as well as a natural consequence of inactivity and aging; it significantly diminishes quality of life. The expression of a group of novel genes called atrogins (atrophy-specific genes) increases dramatically in skeletal muscles of fasting organisms and decreases rapidly upon resumption of feeding. One of these, MuRF-1 (Muscle- specific RING Finger-1), has been identified as an E3 ubiquitin ligase that is a component of atrophy-associated accelerated proteolysis. Ubiquitin pathway enzymes are considered excellent molecular targets for diverse indications, Thus, MuRF-1 is an attractive target for preventing or reversing muscle wasting associated with various pathologies. In a phase I grant application, it was proposed to establish an assay to screen MuRF-1 activity using a yeast based reporter assay in which human E3 ligase MuRF-1 was expressed along with a presumed substrate cardiac troponin. The yeast expression strain was generated, and it functioned as proposed, but numerous attempts at validation of this assay led to the conclusion that a robust screening assay could not be developed using the yeast system. The alternative approach -- an in vitro assay for MuRF-1ubiquitylation activity -- was subsequently undertaken and the in vitro assay was validated for high throughput screening (z' gt 0.6). In phase II it is proposed to utilize the in vitro E3 ligase assay to screen small molecule libraries (Maybridge HitFinder, Prestwick Chemical and Chembridge Premium Set libraries) to identify inhibitors of MuRF-1 (both self- ubiquitylation and substrate ubiquitylation). E3 RING finger ligases CARP2 and Praja-1 and the HECT domain ligase E6AP, which have been purified at Progenra, will be employed in selectivity screens and screening hits will be characterized in additional assays, including cell- based assays, to establish the specificity and efficacy of the inhibitors. Initial preclinical evaluation and chemical optimization will also be performed on selected lead compounds. The identification of specific inhibitors of MuRF-1 is the first step in the development of a class of novel targeted therapies for muscle wasting. These therapies should be efficacious in treating muscle wasting associated with aging, cancer, diabetes, and other chronic conditions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Muscle atrophy (wasting), also known as myopathy, is a clinical complication of many diseases, e.g., cancer, AIDS, and diabetes, as well as a natural consequence of inactivity and aging; it significantly diminishes quality of life. A lack of effective therapies for muscle wasting has led to a search for new medicines based on molecular targets that have recently been identified. One of these targets is an enzyme called MuRF-1, which is linked to the degradation of muscle tissue; inhibitors of this enzyme may be effective therapies against muscle wasting. Progenra has developed a biochemical assay that can be used to identify chemical compounds that inhibit MuRF-1; in the second phase, it is proposed to use the assay to screen several compound collections and to place the most active and selective inhibitors found into development leading to clinical trial for muscle wasting.",

Phase II work will consist of using this assay to find suitable inhibitors and making them drug-like by applying medicinal chemistry. In this supplemental project, the best of these inhibitors of MuRF-1 will be tested in cellular and animal models of muscle wasting as an initial step in their pre-clinical development; this will shorten the time it takes to move them into clinical trials. Ultimately, one of these compounds may advance to the clinic and market for the treatment of muscle wasting.",

        "abstract": "Remote sensing technologies are used to identify activities associated with the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.  Remote sensing requires the extraction of as much information as possible from the available measured energy, in order to identify objects of interest in the scene. Polarization is a fundamental property of light that is not typically exploited because of the additional difficulties in sensing and processing the information.  However, polarization has the potential to increase signal-to-noise ratios, enhance man-made objects in contrast to a natural background, provide increased image stability in the infrared region of the spectrum, and characterize the shape and orientation of objects.  This project will design, build, and deliver a small, portable, and affordable imaging polarimeter system for the detection and identification of important image features.  Phase I developed two viable multi-camera imaging infrared polarimeter designs, tested algorithms that enhance the recognition of polarized scene elements, and collected and tested tools needed for simulation and analysis.  Phase II will build, calibrate, and test the two infrared imaging polarimeter systems.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  A small, portable, and inexpensive polarization-sensitive infrared imaging system would be useful in many environmental monitoring applications where changes of texture occur.  These applications include the detection of ice in surfaces, oil slicks, anti-personnel land mines, and other human-induced changes in natural scenes.",

        "abstract": "The role of clouds in climate and weather is known to be very important, but is still not fully understood.  Making accurate and comprehensive observations is the first step towards fuller discovery and understanding.  This project will develop an innovative passive microwave remote sensor that will be able to observe cloud parameters such as extinction, total water content, liquid plus ice, liquid and ice separately, temperature, and water vapor profiles.  The instrument will be highly integrated, compact, and lightweight (about the size of a loaf of bread with a weight less than 5 kg); will operate with minimal power consumption; will have an ability to scan 360\u00b0 in a vertical plane without polarization vector mixing; and will have antenna beamwidths greater than 6\u00b0.  Phase I selected optimal channels for observations, design instrument mechanics, develop a calibration scheme and an electrical block diagram, and demonstrate the integration of critical components for a receiver. Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The simplicity, small size, and minimal power consumption of the passive radiometer would give this device a significant advantage over radars, lidars and other active instruments.  The future customer base should include research institutions within NOAA, NASA, NCAR, and others.  The broader society would benefit from improved weather forecasts, more detailed and more exact hurricane track forecasts, and warnings of droughts and floods",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary long-term goal of this project is to develop a useful, practical, valid, and reliable tool to improve the quality of life (QOL) of people in dementia care settings. Specific objectives of the Phase II project include developing and evaluating user-friendly software and procedures on the iPod Touch Platform to collect and manage QOL data and produce care-relevant information; and evaluate the longer term implementation of the mOQOLD system in diverse dementia care settings. Secondary long-term goals include: (1) increased satisfaction of dementia care staff, (2) increased satisfaction of family members of these participants, (3) improved marketability of the dementia care programs, and (4) developing benchmarking dementia-specific QOL data. Quality of life includes both subjective and objective elements. For instance, Whitehouse et al. include the integration of cognitive functioning, activities of daily living, social interaction, and psychological well-being. The proposed project uses an observational procedure that focuses on the level of engagement and affect/emotion of people with dementia to measure QOL. This study will assess the practicality, and usefulness of the mOQOLD system of data collection, data management, and information-generation implemented on the iPod Touch device and business intelligence platform. User-friendly software on an iPod Touch and procedures to record and manage dementia-specific QOL data and produce care-relevant information will be fully developed. Two staff members in each of ten dementia care settings including skilled nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and adult day centers will be trained to use the system. Staff will collect data and generate reports regarding ten people with dementia over a seven-month period at each site. Surveys and interviews/focus groups with site staff participants, as well as data collected directly on the iPod Touch, will provide evaluative feedback regarding: the ease of data collection; the ease and usefulness of gathering data; the fit between the QOL system and a typical day in the care setting and any disruptions in the typical day caused by the system; specific ways in which the information could be used; suggestions for improving each component of the system; metrics such as errors that occurred during the process and the use of help menus. These data will be used to improve the functionality of the system to better meet the needs of users in the three types of dementia care settings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The mOQOLD (mobile Observing Quality of Life in Dementia) system is a reliable, valid, and practical tool for researchers, practitioners, and assessors to obtain quality of life data about people with dementia in skilled care, assisted living, and adult day settings. mOQOLD will enable service providers to identify activities that maximize quality of life of people with dementia resulting in more positive, person-centered interactions. Additional benefits include improved ability to assess the impact of new activities/interventions, and developing quantitative information that can inform staff training, be shared with family members regarding their loved ones life, and be used by assessors to more accurately evaluate dementia care settings.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chinese-American family caregivers to elders with dementia experience tremendous strain. The ordinary strain of caregiving, which is in itself significant, is compounded among Chinese-American caregivers due to cultural factors that restrict their use of external services, and social isolation that limits access to culturally competent information and services. To address unmet service needs and reduce disparities in caregiver outcomes, we implemented a Phase I SBIR project to develop a prototype culturally-competent website for Chinese-American family caregivers. We successfully accomplished all Phase I aims. The purpose of our Phase II SBIR project is to expand the prototype website (DementiaCareHome) to include a multi-media, multilingual, and interactive educational and support e-intervention for Chinese American family dementia caregivers. Specific Phase II aims are to: (1) expand the Phase I prototype into a fully functioning e-intervention program for Chinese-speaking family dementia caregivers; (2) conduct formative evaluations on context-rich caregiver stories and interactive features of the DementiaCareHome website; (3) conduct a randomized trial to evaluate effectiveness of the e-intervention on primary caregiver outcomes; and (4) market and commercialize the e-intervention to ensure its financial and administrative sustainability. DementiaCareHome will be developed to include the following features: (a) multi-lingual educational information to fulfill the diverse language needs of the Chinese American community; (b) tailored caregiver stories to engage the target audience; (c) interactive functions to help Chinese family caregivers interact with other caregivers, experts, and their own family members across geographical distance; and, (d) a range of culturally-specific issues common to dementia caregivers of varying Chinese cultural origins and/or immigration backgrounds integrated into its educational and interactive components. Importantly, we will also involve both end users (i.e., Chinese-American caregivers) and cultural/information brokers (i.e., healthcare professionals in the Chinese-American community) to ensure cultural competence in the final product, and to ensure success in community adoption and dissemination of the intervention. This SBIR Phase II proposal represents the first ever comprehensive e-intervention program for Chinese- American family caregivers. The resulting product will create an interactive online community for Chinese- American caregivers, with capabilities for reaching multiple strata of users in the Chinese-American community, and in so doing, provide an innovative way to reduce striking disparities in outcomes among Chinese-American family caregivers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of this Phase II SBIR is to develop a multi-media, multilingual, and interactive psycho-educational e-intervention for Chinese American family dementia caregivers.",
