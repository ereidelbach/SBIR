APPLICATIONS OF HOLOGRAPHIC LENSES TO HUD WERE LIMITED IN THE PAST, DUE TO WIDE SPECTRAL BAND OF THE HUD - CATHODE RAY TUBE (CRT). HOWEVER, WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF NARROWER SPECTRAL BAND CRTS, THE UTILIZATION OF HOLOGRAPHIC COMPONENTS HAVE BECOME VERY ATTRACTIVE. HOLOGRAPHIC COMBINERS HAVE ALREADY BEEN SHOWN AS VIABLE REPLACEMENT OF CONVENTIONAL COMBINERS TO INCREASE INSTANTANEOUS FIELD OF VIEW OF THE HUD. IN THE PROPOSED EFFORT WE PLAN TO DESIGN AND FABRICATE TRANSMISSION HOLOGRAMS TO REPLACE THE EXISTING RELAY OPTICS. WE PLAN TO MODEL HOLOGRAMS AS THIN COMPONENTS WITH EXTREMELY LARGE REFRACTIVE INDICES, AND FABRICATE THE HOLOGRAMS BY INTERFERONMETRIC RECORDING IN DICHROMATE GELATIN FOR LARGE SPACE BANDWIDTH PRODUCT AND HIGH DIFFRACTION EFFICIENCY. WE WILL DESIGN HOLOGRAMS USING COMPUTER LENS DESIGN SOFTWARE PACKAGE. SUBSEQUENT TO THE FABRICATION OF THE COMPONENTS, WE WILL TEST AND ANALYZE THEIR PERFORMANCE.",

THE TECHNIQUES WILL ENABLE DIRECT MEASUREMENTS OF RECEPTOR CONCENTRATION ON A CELL-BY-CELL BASIS. THIS IS AN IMPROVEMENT OVER THE CURRENT BIOCHEMICAL ASSAYS, WHICH GIVE ONLY AN AVERAGE VALUE FOR RECEPTOR CONCENTRATION. THE QUANTITATIVE ASSAY PROPOSED FOR DEVELOPMENT WILL ALLOW FOR AMEASUREMENT OF THE HETEROGENEITY OF CONCENTRATION OF RECEPTORS IN CELL POPULATIONS AND THE PROPORTION OF CELLS INA TUMOR POPULATION THAT HAVE ESTROGEN RECEPTOR ABOVE A CERTAIN CONCENTRATION LEVEL. THE RECENT DEVELOPMENT OF MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES AGAINST ESTROGEN RECEPTORS MAKES THE DEVELOPMENT OF METHODS FOR IMMUNOCYTOCHEMICAL LOCALIZATION OF ESTROGEN RECEPTORS FEASIBLE. ADDITIONAL RECENT ADVANCES IN QUANTITATIVE IMAGING CYTOLOGY CAN BE COMBINED WITH THIS TO DEVELOP A FAST, EFFICIENT, AND MORE ACCURATE ASSAY METHODAND TO ELIMINATE THE VISUAL SUBJECTIVE COMPONENTS OF THE METHOD. THIS COMBINATION OF THESE NEW TECHNIQUES TO PRODUCEA NEW QUANTITATIVE ASSAY IS PARTICULARILY IMPORTANT, AS IT HAS ALREADY BEEN SHOWN THAT PATIENTS WHOSE TUMORS CONTAIN ESTROGEN RECEPTORS WILL HAVE A HIGHER PROBABILITY OF RESPONDING TO HORMONAL THERAPY AND SEEM TO HAVE A BETTER PROGNOSIS THAN PATIENTS WHOSE TUMORS DO NOT CONTAIN THIS RECEPTOR.",

USING AS AN EXAMPLE THE CONTROL OFA TYPICAL THERMAL PROCESS, FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS ARE IDENTIFIED AND OPERATIONAL MODES SPECIFIED IN ORDER TO DELINEATE SUBSYSTEM HIERARCHIES AND INTERACTIONS. EACH PROCESS SUBSYSTEM IS CONTROLLED LOCALLY VIA AN ADAPTIVE DYNAMIC CONTROLLER DESIGNED TO MEET LOCAL CONTROL OBJECTIVES. A QUASI STEADY-STATE APPROACH IS ADOPTED TO INTEGRATE THE LOCAL DYNAMIC CONTROLLERS INTO A HIERARCHICAL STRUCTURE SATISFYING MINIMUM ENERGY OBJECTIVES. THIS DECOUPLING OF SYSTEM LEVEL CONTROLS FROM THE SUBSYSTEM DYNAMIC BEHAVIOR IS MADE POSSIBLE THROUGH DIFFERENCES IN TIME RESPONSES. FINALLY, THE LAST CONTROL HIERARCHY IS INVOLVED WITH THE INTELLIGENT CONTROL OF THE PROCESS UNDER EMERGENCY CONDITIONS. A METHODOLOGY BASED UPON HEURISTICS MAY BE EMPLOYED IN ORDER TO INCORPORATE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR DECISION- MAKING, CONTROL, AND LEARNING IN MULTIVARIABLE, NONLINEAR PROCESSES, SUCH AS THE THERMAL PROCESS CONSIDERED.

THE RESULT HAS BEEN AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF INFANTS AT RISK FOR LATER INTELLECTUAL RETARDATION. HAPPILY, 80 TO 90% OF HIGH-RISK INFANTS ARE INTELLECTUALLY NORMAL LATER IN LIFE. UNFORTUNATELY, NO VALID SCREENING DEVICE FOR DIFFERENTIATING INFANTS WHO WILL LATER BE INTELLECTUALLY NORMAL FROM THOSE WHO WILL BE RETARDED IS AVAILABLE. THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUCH A DEVICE WOULD HAVE TWO ADVANTAGES. THE FIRST IS THAT PARENTS OF THE MAJORITY OF INFANTS SCREENED COULD BE RELIEVED OF THEIR ANXIETY AND ENCOURAGED TO TREAT THEIR INFANTS AS INTELLECTUALLY NORMAL. THE SECOND IS THAT IDENTIFICATION OF MENTAL RETARDATION DURING INFANCY MAY ALLOW A FULLER UNDERSTANDING OF THE CAUSES OF SUCH DEFICIT. THE MAIN AIM OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT IS TO MAKE A SCREENING DEVICE AVAILABLE TO CLINICIANS SO THAT INFANTS WHO WILL LATER BE INTELLECTUALLY NORMAL OR MENTALLY RETARDED MAY BE IDENTIFIED DURING THE FIRST YEAR OF LIFE. THE FAGAN TEST OF INFANT INTELLIGENCE (COPYRIGHT 1981, J.F. FAGAN, III) IS A VALID SCREENING DEVICE FOR THE EARLY IDENTIFICATION OF LATER MENTAL RETARDATION.

WHILE THESE PROVIDE ADMIRABLE TECHNICAL QUALITIES THEY ALSO PRESENT SOME FORMIDABLE PROBLEMS. THE BIGGEST OF THESE ARE THEIR HIGH PRICES AND THE AMOUNT OF CRATE SPACE THEY REQUIRE. THE PRICE PROBLEM COMES INTO PLAY AT SPEEDS ABOVE 1MHZ SINCE THESE MODULES USE FLASH CONVERTERS THAT ARE VERY EXPENSIVE. THE OTHER FEATURE ASSOCIATED WITH RECORDERS IS THEIR MEMORY REQUIREMENTS, WHICH ARE USUALLY SUBSTANTIAL. THESE MODULES WERE DEISGNED WITH 4K AND 16K MEMORIES, THE END RESULT BEINGLARGE, EXPENSIVE MODULES.

SPECIFICALLY THE INSTRUMENTATION WILL BE APPLIED TO UNDERSTANDING THE BIOPHYSICAL CONTROLS WHICH REGULATE AND MODIFY PLANT GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT. THE INSTRUMENT WILL BEBUILT AROUND A STANDARD \"OFF-THE-SHELF\" GLASS CULTURE VESSELMODIFIED TO ACCEPT A SPECIALLY DESIGNED STERILIZABLE FORCING-FRAME. THE FORCING-FRAME WILL BE EQUIPPED WITH SENSITIVE LOAD-CELLS AND DISPLACEMENT TRANSDUCERS WHICH WILLCONTINUOUSLY KEEP TRACK OF THE APPLIED LOAD AND THE GROWTH OR DEFORMATION OF THE TISSUE. AN EXTERNAL MICROPROCESSOR BASED CONTROL SYSTEM WILL CONTINUOUSLY MONITOR EXPERIMENTAL VARIABLES AND ADJUST THE CONTROLLABLE PARAMETERS (APPLIED LOAD OR STRAIN RATE) ACCORDING TO ANY ONE OF A NUMBER OF EXPERIMENTAL ALGORITHMS. THE FORCING-FRAME AND BASIC MECHANICAL ACTUATOR DESIGN ARE ALREADY ESTABLISHED, AND EXIST IN A PROTOTYPE FORM.

IT WILL HAVE TWO OBJECTIVES; (A) IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF COMPONENTS CURRENTLY PRODUCED BY CASTING, AND (B) FACILITATE THE APPLICATION OF CASTING METHODS TO OTHER COMPONENTS THUS REDUCING COSTS. WE PROPOSE TO ACHIEVE THESE OBJECTIVES BY DEVELOPING A COMPUTER MODEL FOR THE CASTING PROCESS WHICH PREDICTS MICROPOROSITY FORMATION. THE MAIN TASK ADDRESSED IN THIS PROPOSAL IS THE DETAILED TREATMENT OF THE METALLURGICAL FEATURES OF SOLIDIFICATION. THE MODEL WILL HAVE THE ABILITY TO PREDICT THE DEPTH OF THE FREEZING INTERFACE, THE FINENESS OF THE GROWING DENDRITES, AND THE PARTITIONING OF DISSOLVED GAS, AND WILL COMPUTE FLUID FLOW NEAR THE ADVANCING SOLID-LIQUID INTERFACE. HENCE, WE WILL PREDICT THE POSITION AND SIZE OF VOIDS FORMED DURING FREEZING. THE RESULTS WILL BE COMPARED WITH OBSERVATIONS. BY ADDING A MORE DETAILED HEAT FLOW TREATMENT (IN TASK III BUT MAINLY IN PHASE II), COUPLED WITH PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE AND SOME EXPERIMENTATION THE MODEL COULD BE READILY EXTENDED TO MORE COMPLEX CASTIG SHAPES.",

THIS RESEARCH IS MOTIVATED BY THE POTENTIAL BENEFIT OF BEING ABLE TO CARRY OUT AUTOMATED IN VITRO GENETIC TOXICOLOGY ASSAYS WITH SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED TIMES AND COSTS. OUR NEW TECHNOLOGY AIMS TO USE LARGE NUMBERS (E.G., 109 CELLS) WITH INSTRUMENTATION BASED ON OPTICAL MEASUREMENTS AND RAPID COMPUTER DETERMINATIONS. OUR OVERALL STRATEGY IS TO DEVELOP BOTH IN VITRO MAMMALIAN CELL CULTURE TECHNIQUES AND RELATED INSTRUMENTATION, SO THAT MANY MAMMALIAN TOXICOLOGY ASSAYS DEVELOPED BY OTHERS CAN BE CARRIED OUT MORE RAPIDLY AND WITH LESS EXPENSE. THE KEY IS THE ABILITY TO QUANTITATE SMALL NUMBERS (E.G., 100 TO 1,000) OF MUTANT CELLS OUT OF AN INITIAL POPULATION OF 109 MAMMALIAN CELLS, AND TO DO THIS WITHIN A FEW DAYS. FOR MAMMALIAN CELLS WHICH HAVE A TYPICAL DIVISION TIME OF 1 DAY, THIS MIGHT TRANSLATE INTO A TECHNOLOGY WHICH CAN DETECT SMALL NUMBERS OF MICROCLONES (2 TO 32 CELLS) OF MAMMALIAN CELLS.

THIS SUCCESSFUL PROJECT WAS JUDGED AS A \"BREAKTHROUGH\" BY THE SP-100 ORGANIZATION, AND THE SECOND PHASE OF THIS WORK IS NOW STARTING WITH CONTINUED SPONSORSHIP BY USAF. IN MULTIMEGAWATT APPLICATIONS, THE POWER CONDITIONER INPUT VOLTAGE WILL BE IN THE RANGE OF 100 TO 200 VDC FROM DIRECT CONVERSION THERMIONIC, FUEL CELL AND HIGH ENERGY BATTERY STEADY STATE AND \"BURST\" POWER SYSTEMS. HIGHER DC VOLTAGE ARE ALSO BEING ATTEMPTED IN LARGE SOLAR ARRAYS. THIS PROPOSAL PROVIDES A NEW MEANS OF APPLYING THE \"BREAKTHROUGH\" CURRENT SHARING PRINCIPLE TO A NEW CLASS OF SEMICONDUCTORS THAT ARE PARTICULARLY SUITED TO HIGHER OPERATING VOLTAGE, POWER AND TEMPERATURE. AS A RESULT, SPECIFIC MASS TO LESS THAN 0.1 KG/KWE WILL BE ACHIEVED.",

IN RECENT MONTHS,BRONZE PROCESSED MATERIAL WITH PROPERTIES AT LEAST EQUAL, IFNOT SUPERIOR TO THOSE OF THE OTHER APPROACHES, HAS BEEN REPORTED FROM JAPAN; HOWEVER, THIS WAS IN VERY FINE FILAMENTMATERIAL.

THE ASM ACCOMPLISHES REMOTE OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE FOR A 30 YEAR LIFE IN A ZERO-MAN-ACCESS ENVIRONMENT UTILIZING A RUGGED AND MECHANICALLY MODULAR DESIGN. MORE ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY IS NOW AVAILABLE TO ENHANCE AND SUPPLEMENT THE PERFORMANCE AND RELIABILITY OF MANUPULATION SYSTEMS BUILT FOR THIS PURPOSE. ANALYSIS LEADING TO AND SIMPLIFIED MECHANICAL DESIGN IMPLEMENTATION WILL GREATLY REDUCE THE NUMBER OF PARTS DECREASING THE REPLICATION COST AND ENHANCING RELIABILITY. DUE TO ITS MECHANICAL COMPLEXITY, THE ASM ALSO HAS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF BACKLASH. THIS CREATES CONTROL DIFFICULTIES WHICH MINIMIZES ITS POTENTIAL USE AS A ROBOT FOR REPETITIVE TASKS WHICH MAY ARISE (IE, WIPE DOWN DECONTAMINATION, FLANGE UNBOLTING, ETC). ELIMINATION OF BACKLASH WHILE MAINTAINING BACKDRIVABILITY IS FEASIBLE AND WILL BE EXAMINED IN THIS EFFORT. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THE PROPOSED WORK IS TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOP AN ELECTRO- MECHANICAL MANIPULATOR JOINT DESING WHICH PROVIDES MODULARITY BY ELECTRICAL RATHER THAN MECHANICAL INTERCONNECTION. THIS DESIGN WOULD RESULT IN A MECHANICAL SYSTEM WITH SIGNIFICANTLY FEWER MOVING PARTS, ENHANCE RELIABILITY, AND LOWER FABRICATION COSTS. SECONDLY, BY USING A UNIQUE DRIVE MECHANISM AND ACTUATION METHOD, A MANIPULATOR WITH NO BACKLASH AND A LIFT TO WEIGHT RATIO APPROACHING UNITY WILL BE DESIGNED. WITH THESE SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENTS, THE MANIPULATOR WOULD BE ABLE TO FUNCTION EQUALLY WELL AUTONOMOUSLY (AS A ROBOT) OR IN THE TRADITIONALMASTER/SLAVE TELEOPERATOR ARRANGEMENT.

OLIGONUCLEOTIDES OR NICK TRANSLATED CDNA PROBES WILL BE USED TO OBTAIN THE GENOMIC GMCSF DNA. FROM THE CDNA AND/OR GENOMIC DNA, A CODING SEQUENCE FOR GMCSF WILL BE ASSEMBLED. THIS SEQUENCE WILL BE EXPRESSED AS BIOLOGICALLY ACTIVE GMCSF IN TISSUE CULTURE CELLS. EXPRESSION OF BIOLOGICALLY ACTIVE GMCSF WILL PROVIDE INFORMATION FOR DETERMINING THE FEASIBILITY OF OBTAINING PRODUCTION LEVEL EXPRESSION IN PHASE II. THE ANTICIPATED USE OF GMCSF WILL BE TO ENHANCE THE PROLIFERATION OF GRANULOCYTES AND MACROPHAGE IN IMMUNE SUPPRESSED PATIENTS, THEREBY PROVIDING AN INNOVATIVE APPROACH IN COMBINATION WITH CONVENTIONAL CELL REPLACEMENT OR ANTIBIOTIC THERAPY.",
