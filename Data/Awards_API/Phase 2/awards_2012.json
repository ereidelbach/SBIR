Electrical conditioning can also be applied to munition casing to control fragmentation and blast pattern and directionality. Both theoretical and computational tools will be utilized in designing an integrated munition with augmented explosion, selectable fragmentation, and controlled blast to provide scalable and adaptive lethal effects against targets.

        "abstract": "Mixed-augmented reality displayed via a head-mounted display (HMD) provides a new paradigm for military training.  Soldiers may train in real environments but interact with virtual enemy combatants and material that are generated in software.  However, a major issue is that virtual objects are often simply superposed over the background scene, and can therefore appear ghostly and semi-transparent due to the lack of occlusion.  Methods to incorporate occlusion such as optical-relay and video-relay schemes have serious challenges. .  In the proposed effort a new concept for automatic opaqueness generation in a see-through HMD for military training application will be implemented in hardware and software.  Under the Phase II year -1 effort, a prototype HMD with opaqueness tethered to a PC will be designed, assembled, and demonstrated to the customer in laboratory environment. The performance including see-through transmission and contrast generation in the presence of background light will be characterized. In the year-2 effort, the design will be improved and a stand-alone, portable, battery-powered HMD prototype with opaqueness generation will be built. The prototype will be demonstrated in real environments and delivered to the customer.",

The work proposed for the Phase II program will build on the model development, process trials and experimentation performed in Phase I to extend the material/process modeling and property prediction to representative cylinders and missile structures. Development and demonstration of a methodology for material modeling and process simulation of compression molded thermoplastic composites will also be performed as part of the Phase II program. The material and process models will be integrated into a commercial finite element software code for improved structural analysis of thermoplastic composite structures.

Additionally, Kuttas plans call for integrating new features that involve moving target tracking and video mosaics in an innovative fashion to increase the users situational awareness and keep the user focused on the task at hand.  Once all the LIAs are incorporated into the system, Kutta initiates another human factors study to gather metrics on how much the discrete LIAs improve payload control when they are intelligently triggered and managed by the consent of the user.

Despite many advantages, the sodium batteries have several barriers for successful commercialization, mainly related to safety issues and high capital investment for installation.  The current battery cells typically operate at 350\u00b0C at which sodium and sulfur coexist in the liquid state, yielding high electrode reactivity.  The safety issues are primarily related to crack or fracture of the ceramic electrolyte.  Significant part of the high capital cost attributes to complicated and energy-intensive processing of the ceramic electrolyte and also thermal management which is required to maintain the cell temperature.  Materials & Systems Research, Inc. (MSRI) proposes a novel cell design for advanced sodium batteries to overcome all these issues.  The proposed cell design is based on thin film beta\u201d alumina solid electrolyte (BASE) that will be made by a low-cost processing method.  The design ensures greatly enhanced safety by using high-strength support materials.  In addition, the proposed cell design also enables the sodium batteries working at reduced temperatures, thus reducing the cost burden on cell packaging and thermal management.\n",

Due to the nature of its covalent bond, it is very difficult to manufacture full density boron carbide. Commercially, boron carbide is produced by reacting boron oxide (B2O3) and carbon in an electric arc furnace, which results a slush with a composition close to that of B4C.  Due to the noncongruent melting of boron carbide, excess carbon is unavoidable via this method.  Therefore, commercial B4C is a composite of B4C and graphite as the second phase, which reduces its mechanical properties.  Moreover, there is no commercially available boron carbide fiber to addresses the Army&quot;s growing needs in the field of armor.  In this proposal, solutions to both of these shortcomings are addressed by investigating the production of high strength boron carbide fiber and to produce a large volume boron carbide fiber using ACI&quot;s patented viscose suspension spinning process (VSSP) at reasonable cost.  VSSP has been used to manufacture numerous ceramic fiber chemistries including alumina and silicon carbide. This technique is fast and easily scalable for large volume production.",

These differences lead to a situation where radio models are heavily tied to a particular DES.  Ideally, radio models should be DES-agnostic, allowing flexibility in their use to reduce licensing costs, shorten the development cycle, and accelerate the improvement of radio technology.  The objective of the proposed system is to provide a radio model adapter that supports the complete, automatic, and verified conversion of a wide range of radio models.  Our approach addresses all aspects of the problem including identifying necessary translations, designing and implementing an adapter that automatically performs those translations, and testing and validating the conversion of a range of radio models.  A core goal is to serve as an enabling technology to allow legacy radio models to be combined with DESs and other components in new ways, reducing the cost and delays associated with current practices.  The proposed work has the potential to dramatically improve the compatibility and flexibility of existing simulation technologies and models, and has already been demonstrated successfully converting several radio models.",

Innovative materials and device processing methods were modeled in Phase I, and indicate that HgCdTe detector arrays can be employed to improve performance over conventional InGaAs-based systems while simultaneously reducing the array cost.  By utilizing HgCdTe arrays, the camera system developed in this effort will be able to image out to 2.5 micron wavelength, while InGaAs arrays are unable to image efficiently above 1.7 micron.  This will allow the system to collect additional signal from nightglow and facilitate covert communications and tracking in the 1.7 to 2.5 micron range, improving its performance and functionality.  Camera costs will further be reduced by utilizing innovative component integration and moldable optics manufacturing, with a targeted reduction in cost of 10x over traditional SWIR camera systems.  These integration and manufacturing processes will also allow for a fully integrated camera system size of 20 cm3 to be achieved.",

        "abstract": "Use of data from multiple sensors provides the opportunity for improved ballistic missile defense search and tracking. Algorithms for combining multi-sensor data are required. Ballistic missile defense sensor data fusion is a challenging problem because of incompatibility in coordinate systems for different sensors, which makes it difficult to transfer variance and covariance information, and because of sensor registration issues, which result in measurement errors with a consistent bias. To overcome these difficulties, we propose to use a root-mean-square approach to identify bias errors and outliers. The root-mean-square value of a possible missile trajectory expresses the amount of consistency between the measurements that the trajectory should generate, and the actual measurements. Optimization methods including the Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm will be used to find the trajectory with minimum root-mean-square. Sensor bias can be resolved, allowing registration errors to be corrected.  A computer program will be developed to test sensor data streams for autocorrelation, bias errors and outliers and to remove them from the data stream.  Field data and synthetic data will be used to measure the effectiveness of the sensor data fusion algorithms.",

In the proposed concept we will introduce a gas in a loose powder bed as it is being heated.  The gas will be introduced at multiple levels to ensure all the powder is exposed to it and speed up the removal of the PCA by-products to reduce the exposure of the powder to temperature and minimize grain growth.  The system will have no moving parts, which will make it easy to use, and minimizes maintenance costs.  This technology has many commercial applications, especially in powder reduction, heat treatment and delubing, to reduce processing time and improve process control, both of which will enhance the competitiveness of the US manufacturing industry.

The key components of thermal batteries are typically made by hydraulically pressing powders into&quot;pellets&quot;.  The pellets must be greater than a minimum thickness to avoid breakage, and for batteries that must supply high current for a short time this consideration greatly increases size and weight.    In Phase I, we addressed this problem by combining two recent advances in thermal battery technology.  We utilized a thin film component process developed by our collaborators at EaglePicher Technologies to construct thinner components with lower impedance than is possible with pressed powders.  We employed Erigo&quot;s advanced thermal battery simulation software to extract the maximum benefits from this new process and to diagnose and solve problems encountered during testing of battery prototypes.  In Phase II, we will use a model-based development process to construct and test a high performance thin film battery for a specific MDA application.  We expect this will reduce the battery weight by over 50 percent.  We will also demonstrate the use of this technology to construct complete thermal batteries with a prismatic cross-section.",

        "abstract": "A radar or electronic warfare (EW) system that was primarily digital from the antenna to baseband would offer tremendous flexibility and capability in addition to decreasing the cost, maintenance and ability to upgrade performance. As radars increase in both transmit frequency and bandwidth, achieving this goal becomes more challenging, and the key technology for achieving this is in the conversion from digital to analog and vice versa. Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) and Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) devices are continually pushing the envelope in terms of speed, bandwidth and resolution. Colorado Engineering, Inc. (CEI) proposes to design and fabricate high speed ADC and DAC modules using the latest technology to achieve at least 4 GHz of instantaneous bandwidth (IBW) with a resolution exceeding 8 effective number of bits (ENOB). This exceeds the current state-of-the-art and can significantly impact future system designs by eliminating much of the expensive and performance variable analog RF components between the antenna and digital processing elements including mixers, filters, amplifiers and beamformers.",

        "abstract": "Multimode seekers are receiving significant attention as a way to provide more capability in the same package.  In some cases, both optical and millimeter wave seekers are being combined in a way that requires a common aperture.  The requirements for such a system place a tremendous burden on the design and fabrication of the dome.      Optical fabrication costs for multi-mode seeker domes can be very high. Consequently, it is important to know that a starting dome blank is of sufficient quality to yield a compliant dome, prior to beginning fabrication. This can be achieved by inspection polishing and evaluating each dome blank prior to final fabrication. While this method works, it prohibitively expensive to do on every dome blank. Consequently, this step is either omitted or performed only on a representative blank from each&quot;batch&quot;.    An alternative approach is to develop a method of performing a thorough evaluation of a dome blank with a ground surfaces. In the phase I effort Surmet has demonstrated a process for doing this on 4&quot;diameter subscale domes.  Under the Phase II effort the process will be further optimized, automated, and scaled to allow inspection of 7 inch diameter nearly hemispherical domes.",

Improvement in material quality and processing technique, as well as evolutionary modifications in device architecture have demonstrated the advantages of the material system over alternatives, and proven it as a viable candidate for the next generation infrared imaging. Yet, the performance of this material system has not fully reached its limits.  In this project, we propose to build upon the gap-engineering capability of Type-II superlattices to develop FPAs based on a novel quantum device architecture called Minority Electron Unipolar Photodetector (MEUP). The design is a hybrid between conventional photoconductive and photovoltaic detectors and benefits from the advantages of both configurations. The novel device architecture is expected to achieve high quantum efficiency while decreasing the dark current and the associated shot-noise. Material growth will be realized on 3&quot;GaSb substrates and optimized for the highest quality and best uniformity across the wafer. Applying it to LWIR FPAs in this Phase II, it is expected to achieve a quantum efficiency above 60% and a dark current density below 1uA/cm^2 at operating temperatures higher than 65 K.",

Social network research needs access to realistic social media datasets for testing social network theory and developing network algorithms. However, the available social network data are either small, static, or cannot be readily collected or shared due to anonymization, privacy, and complexity issues. We will design and implement scalable algorithms, methods and software tools to generate realistic social network data with respect to multi-dimensional network analytical functions and validate it with a comprehensive set of statistical, temporal, and topological metrics, and application-level benchmarks. Our key innovative solution is based on capturing dynamic (visible or latent/hidden) interactions, patterns/anomalies, information flows/cascades along with the coupled dynamics of network structure and data content (topics, sentiments, and memes) to synthesize social media. Our approach generates fully anonymous social network data that can be distributed for public use by researchers. By leveraging advanced tools from graph-theoretic, statistical, topological and time-series analysis, we will provide an integrated architecture and technology base to support diversity of emerging social media types and deploy strategic social network applications for high fidelity social network synthesis.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on developing the first artificial intelligence (AI) educational software to tutor literary Braille to blind/visually impaired students. Braille is the primary medium for written communication for persons who are blind and there has been a dramatic decline in Braille literacy, negatively impacting academic performance, ability to navigate the everyday world and employment opportunities. The ability to bring proven effective AI technology to the table, which is unprecedented in this area of special education, will make a meaningful difference in providing equitable education opportunities to all students, as this project speaks directly to issues of basic literacy. The proposed intervention is an Internet-based adaptive learning system that provides expert instruction on demand during general and special education at school and at home. The software is supplemental to existing curricula, uses standard accessibility technology and integrates directly with existing lessons. In addition to improving learning outcomes for students, this project also includes support for mainstream teachers and teachers of the visually impaired (TVIs). To ensure the product is effective in real-world settings, ongoing formative evaluations with teachers/TVIs will be conducted and student outcomes will be measured during a year two field study. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be the first-ever Braille education software based on AI, delivered on-demand through the Internet. The anticipated impact is that students achieve literacy and are able to perform at a higher level (e.g. academics, daily living, employment) resulting in improved quality of life and increased societal contributions. To have an impact, the product must be affordable, effective for a heterogeneous population in diverse learning environments, easy to use and easily accessed at convenient times and locations in informal and formal educational settings. In SBIR research supported by NIH, Quantum has successfully created the first-ever AI-based educational software that is accessible to the blind (in chemistry and mathematics). Furthermore, Quantum has patented and commercialized unique AI technologies in chemistry and accounting using a business-to-business licensing model that provides educational companies with first-to-market and strong sustainable advantages. This model engages the entire spectrum of educational vendors, offering breakthrough technology that permits increased market share for customers and rapid dissemination to end users. For this project, Quantum will partner with organizations with established channels, who distribute the software as an online service, such as the American Printing House for the Blind, a partner on this project.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will demonstrate a prototype of a high-throughput, agile, low-cost manufacturing system for tile mosaics. Mosaics have been a source of visual splendor for millennia, but they have always required arduous and painstaking hand assembly. Our Phase I proved the feasibility of a programmable, high-throughput robotic tile-assembly system to enhance the production of mosaic tilings. Phase II R &amp; D will build upon Phase I success to further speed up, automate and scale the system, develop an effective agile manufacturing management system, and analyze the economic viability of robotic mosaic assembly for Phase III. We will accomplish this by enhancing the mechanical processes and reducing operator time - in addition to developing a productionflow information system. After Phase II system optimization, we will evaluate the commercial potential of the Artaic technology. The anticipated technical result will be providing a 5x faster manufacturing process with a 75% reduction in the price per square foot of customizable mosaic tilings produced. The intellectual merits of this SBIR project involve Artaic?s disruptive robotic technology, which transforms mosaic installation from its current, time-consuming manual labor processes to a rapid, robotically directed customizable process. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project expands the utilization of artisanal mosaic work while increasing the competitive advantage of U.S. manufacturing processes through increased automation and customization. Successful development of this technology will enable a breakthrough pricing structure that is 75% lower than the competition (based on manual and rudimentary automated processes), leading to broad market affordability and widespread commercial adoption. Our robotic system has the potential to revolutionize the $76B global tile industry, while creating numerous domestic job opportunities. Artaic expects that the 5x increase in manufacturing speed realized during Phase I will be maintained in Phase II during manufacturing scale-up without loss of placement accuracy. The increased understanding of robotic agile manufacturing-enabled mass customization processes will expand the scientific understanding of related robotic processes that utilize highthroughput flexible assemblies, such as for medical or pharmaceutical technologies, or for consumer products. In addition, classical mosaic techniques will become more accessible as an art form to all students, while undergraduate students will increase their understanding of STEM concepts through engineering courses utilizing this technology. Artists and designers will find the realization of their design work much more practical and affordable as a business enterprise.",

Energy storage technologies such as batteries and capacitors are insufficient for these AT systems due to their limited capacity.

The main challenge in Phase-II is to reduce the driving voltage down to 0.1v/\u00ecm. The main objectives and approaches in Phase-II are: (1) to develop a passive matrix MESA-LCD prototype (the first generation) for presenting to the potential investors; (2) to optimize the photoalignment process for driving voltage reduction, (3) to develop an active matrix MESA-LCD prototype (second generation) with the optimized photoalignment material and process, with establishment of large scale manufacturing processes. Anticipated Phase-II results would be the successful development of MESA-LCD prototypes for commercialization. The broader impacts/commercial potential will be that the MESA-LCD related technologies will benefit from the low power, high contrast ratio and high resolution. Success of this project will enable a high performance and low cost MESA-LCD that have a significant market opportunity in mobile devices to bring users information and Entertainment, offer users a convergent display experience, with paper-like readability, significantly less power consumption, and video-rate response times. The most important market the MESA-LCD addresses is e-paper and e-book market.

Initially, both of these batteries employed the legacy lithium-silicon alloy (LiSi) / FeS2 (naturally-occurring iron pyrite) electrochemistry. In 2006, Raytheon communicated the need to significantly upgrade the performance capabilities of the GS battery. As part of an upgrade ENSER substituted its low impedance CoS2-based cathode in place of conventional FeS2. Along with a minor change in cell diameter, ENSER&quot;s CoS2 cathode technology enabled a 58% increase in usable energy over the legacy GS battery while maintaining an average power of 404 watts vs. 226 watts. Thus, the LiSi / CoS2 chemistry enabled a significant increase in usable energy even when discharged at a 78% higher power level. In addition to CoS2, ENSER now has an entire cadre of new thermal battery materials, along with tape-casting capability for conformal shapes, which are available for evaluation and insertion into the AIM-9X CAS battery. Based on this extensive development and AIM-9X battery production experience, ENSER is uniquely positioned to undertake the proposed effort.",

The current limitations of these systems (e.g. cost, size, and power consumption) are mainly due to the inadequacy of commercially available sound sources for this application. What is needed to move the technology forward are sound sources that provide a higher sound pressure level, compact size, lower power consumption, and low cost. In addition, these components need to be reliable for long periods of continuous operation in ambient conditions and must be uniform in performance from part-to-part and batch-to-batch. No such commercial sound sources exist in the marketplace today that meet all of these requirements. Omega will build upon the work from Phase I to develop and optimize innovative new sound sources for this application.  The performance (SPL at a given size and power input), reliability, and uniformity of the new sound sources will be maximized by optimization of the design and materials in the sound source as well as the manufacturing process.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  During normal course of research, development, and testing by AFRL at EAFB, small quantities of environmentally hazardous propellant, explosive, and pyrotechnic (PEP) wastes are produced.  The objective of this SBIR Phase II project is to construct and field-demonstrate a prototype capable of destroying 30 pounds per month of PEP waste at AFRL Propellant Research Laboratory.  After the successful field-testing, this prototype can be installed at EAFB to destroy all PEP wastes produced by AFRL. CHA Microwave Energetic Laboratory waste Disposal System (MELDS) destroys small quantities of PEP waste on-site at military, industrial and university laboratories. The system was designed to destroy both liquid and solid slurry wastes and contaminated laboratory supplies and to operate in research laboratories whenever small quantities of PEPs are generated.  During Phase I work a complete destruction of hydrazines, nitroaromatics, and perchlorates in solution was experimentally demonstrated with no hazardous air or water emissions.  Additionally the destruction of contaminated laboratory supplies, such as gloves and paper towels was accomplished without hazardous air emissions.  The MELDS is small enough to install inside a laboratory and economically advantageous compared to currently available disposal technologies. The MELDS can also destroy hazardous medical wastes and toxic chemicals on-site as generated.   BENEFIT:  The proposed microwave disposal system requires less than $158,000 installation footprint. It will treat up to 30 pounds per month environmentally hazardous waste produced by military and other research laboratories, and medical facilities. Operation of this system can reduce the indicated environmentally hazardous waste disposal annualized costs by up to 80%, without creating air and water pollutants.",

There is also extra vulnerability rendered by the military&quot;s dependence on this sole energy source for all operations. Hence, the army is interested in developing capability to produce liquid hydrocarbon fuel from dilute (~385 ppm) but vastly abundant CO2 and water in the atmosphere anywhere on the globe.  The key challenge in such a technology is to recover CO2 and water available at ppmv level in air and provide them as concentrated streams that are needed for conversion to hydrocarbon fuels.     TDA Research, Inc. proposes to develop a novel chemical sorbent-based solid-state compressor to collect and concentrate dilute atmospheric CO2 and H2O and use them as chemical feedstock to produce liquid hydrocarbon fuels.    In Phase I, we developed a viable sorbent and demonstrated its efficacy in removing CO2 and H2O from ambient air.  In Phase II, we will develop a sub-scale prototype system to demonstrate the technical feasibility of the concept and perform many absorption and regeneration cycles (at a minimum 1,000 cycles) to identify the chemical life and mechanical durability of the sorbent.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Air Force operations require more real-time situational awareness and sensor deployment from extended stand-off distances and for longer durations. Sensor data obtained from current gunship operations is limited by stand-off distance constraints, the resolution of onboard sensors, and the inability to see below the weather to the objective area.  A system solution is needed that can increase the capabilities of current Air Force operations by supporting varying sensor capabilities safely and in an affordable manner. An Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) that can be deployed from a manned host aircraft is an ideal solution to this capability gap. An air-launched UAS can capitalize on the long-range, fast response capabilities of the host aircraft while also providing agile and minimal detection sensor data collection, signaling, ground sensor delivery, and threat elimination after deployment from the host aircraft.  The proposed design will fill the current capability gap for Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) and strike capabilities immediately and affordably by employing an assortment of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) sub-systems, modular payload support, a well-supported host aircraft integration and deployment plan, and innovative manufacturing techniques.  BENEFIT:  Military and civilian personnel could utilize the proposed air deployed UAS as an additional tool in the performance of their services. The UAS integrates seamlessly into the existing manned aircraft infrastructure and therefore complements the capabilities of the military and civilian users. For instance, the UAS developed under this effort could be deployed from a manned aircraft and be flown into high risk areas to aid soldiers during night operations. The UAS would permit the manned aircraft to stay out of harms way by providing persistent surveillance over a specific area or along convoy routes. This system can also loiter along border regions to collect data for Homeland Security groups with limited manned aircraft assets and limited situational awareness. Moreover, the UAS could be deployed from a US Forest Service manned platform to search for ideal locations for fire breaks or from Search and Rescue helicopters to locate hikers lost in rugged terrain. In summary, the highly versatile, small UAS has the potential to perform a variety of missions over an extended period of time, complementing the existing capabilities of manned aircraft.",

The transition of clinical neuroscience tools into operational environments is of particular interest to the military due to the need for soldiers to perform increasingly complex tasks under extremely difficult conditions. Successful transition into operational environments hinges on the ability to obtain high quality electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings in the presence of electromagnetic interference (EMI) and other physiologic artifacts in a manner that is comfortable and compatible with personal protective equipment. Quantitative analysis of EEG can be used to determine concentration, fatigue, and excessive workload provided that high quality, artifact-free signals can be recorded. The adverse nature of the environment, combined with the relatively low amplitude of EEG signals, necessitates the use of head simulators to evaluate different recording systems, signal processing methodologies, and the impact of environmental conditions before collection of operational recordings from soldiers. This project aims to develop a head simulator capable of providing realistic EEG recordings in a wide variety of operational conditions.",

Over short time scales (e.g., milliseconds), these high-bandwidth links are plagued by scintillation fading due to atmospheric turbulence and (possibly) boundary layer effects (e.g., at the surface of fast moving aircraft in ship-air links). Although somewhat analogous to the mutlipath-induced fading that is familiar in mobile RF communications, optical scintillation-induced fades typically span thousands to millions of symbols  rather than tens to hundreds  due to the higher symbol rates and longer fade durations. Consequently, solutions for combating fading in RF links do not readily extend to Lasercomm. During Phase I, TrellisWare showed that a modern coded-protocol can offer dramatic throughput improvements over existing state-of-the-art baseband approaches in scintillation-induced fading FSO links. In this Phase II, TrellisWare proposes to further study the design and protocol to demonstrate that our approach can be effectively and efficiently implemented for use on real maritime and expeditionary links.

        "abstract": "Raman spectroscopy is a highly effective non-contact laser remote sensing method for detecting and identifying chemicals in every-day field environments. Raman spectroscopy is particularly suited for detecting trace surface contaminants that may indicate the presence of explosives, harmful chemical or biological agents. Contemporary systems, such as the vehicle mounted Joint Contaminated Surface Detector (JCSD), use gaseous KrF excimer lasers operating at 248 nm as the pump laser source. One of the key objections to the KrF laser is the unique maintenance requirements for on-site gas refilling operations that complicate logistics and severely limit that systems reliability. In this SBIR program Arete Associates will develop an efficient, compact, light-weight and rugged diode-pumped solid-state laser alternative. The laser source is based on a frequency quadrupled Q-switched single-frequency Nd:YAG laser operating on the 946 nm transition to achieve the desired 236 nm output. This method is capable of meeting the operating specifications of&lt;45 pm linewidth,&gt;7 mJ pulse energy, 25 Hz pulse repetition rate,&gt;50 ns pulsewidth,&lt;25 lbs,&lt;1800 cu. in and&gt;10,000 hrs operational lifetime. Arete will utilize proprietary single-frequency, injection-seeded, large mode volume resonator designs; advanced composite gain module structures that optimize 946 nm performance; and efficient cascaded frequency doubling in borate crystals to achieve the desired deep UV output wavelength of 236 nm.",

During Phase I, the team prototyped a multifunction mobile device to be carried by the warfighter, equipped with cameras, microphones, and position sensors.  This device sends regular status messages and user initiated A/V queries to an Analysis Server via a wireless data link.  The Analysis Server, which has a high bandwidth connection to the ISR enterprise, integrates the incoming data with other ISR data, and sends query results and context-based alerts back to the mobile device, where they are announced to the user and displayed as a map overlay or augmented reality interface.  For Phase II, the team will build upon this framework to add new features, increase performance, and ready the system for field testing.  This effort will focus on deeper integration with GHub and other DoD projects, incorporation of mission-oriented features, and object detection and classification modules for the mobile device.

It is important to develop highly scalable and effective data warehousing and mining methods for in-depth exploitation and analysis of such data so that various information consumers can gain intelligence from different perspectives. To address this importance, IAI is developing a distributed and standards based data cubing, mining system, SensorCube, for large amounts of geospatial sensor data. The SensorCube consists of three layers: data integration, data cubing and mining, and semantic search. In the data integration layer, an XML driven ETL (Extraction, Transformation, and Loading) process is developed to integrate complex sensor data. In the data cubing and mining layer, a powerful distributed computational engine is developed to model multi-dimensional sensor data. In the semantic search layer, the search and query capability is developed to connect the meta data and information summarized in data cubes and mining models. Furthermore, the semantic search and cubing visualization can be accessible across different computational platform such as smart phones and tablets.",

A promising approach is to build synthetic networks based on realistic behaviors that mimic the form and structure of real networks, and then infer behaviors that underlie the real networks from the models used to generate the synthetic ones. In ASPEN Phase I, we integrated: (1) behavioral theory in an agent-based simulation to inform the generation of synthetic networks; (2) social network analysis techniques to test for similarity to empirical networks; and (3) evolutionary algorithms to iteratively increase the fidelity of the synthetic networks. In Phase II, we will extend our use of evolutionary algorithms to explore the relationship between agent behavior and network structure by analyzing data from a social media testbed. This will allow us to move ASPEN from being strictly a synthetic network generator to a powerful research and development tool for social media analysis and influence operations support.",

Integrity Applications Incorporated (IAI) proposes to investigate and demonstrate an airborne tactical design that delivers resolution greater than four times the size of the imaging aperture. This design is based on a revolutionary capability recently demonstrated and submitted for a patent by IAI. The design is superior to others because it is less complex, delivers a larger field of view, and derives MOCOMP data directly from the collected imagery data. In the proposed effort, we will develop and demonstrate a visible waveband, compact synthetic aperture imaging system. We will modify our current demonstration system to have flight-like geometry, demonstrate utility on complex targets and scenes, determine the limitations beyond four times the traditional resolution, and deliver a report that investigates retrofitting our system into common Navy Airborne tactical imaging systems.

In response, we are developing a turbo-Rankine power system that is optimized for hydrothermal vents. Our system consists of discrete components that are packaged to fit optimally within a simple containment structure and around adjacent features and subsystems. Continuous fluid flow within the system will communicate directly with the heat source and heat rejection environment, without intermediate flow loops or large thermal structures. Creare is well suited to succeed; we have a long history of developing advanced turbomachines, heat exchangers, and thermodynamic systems for challenging aerospace and terrestrial applications.

Existing training has focused on specific cognitive schemas for current deployment settings, but these schemas can become obsolete even with small changes in those settings. In our Phase I effort, we designed and demonstrated the feasibility of Microgames for Acquiring and Rehearsing Cognitive Schemas for Perception (MARCS), a suite of lightweight games focused on teaching Combat Hunters to construct and adapt schemas for particular settings or situations to enhance threat perception. Our approach focuses on training metacognitive skills of schema construction to enable context switching and skill transfer.

Detailed modeling and design analysis were conducted to optimize the sensor system for the extremely wide dynamic range of the radiation field from above the surface down to 10 m below.  Under Phase-II a full system will be assembled, including (i) two fiber fed spectrometers with TE cooled cameras to provide long integration time and broad dynamic range, (ii) fiber optics based radiance and irradiance collectors that feed into the spectrometers, (iii) the spectrometers housed in a watertight enclosure with multiple fiber and electrical feedthrough connectors.  Control will be from a computer on board a ship located up to 300 m away to avoid shading.\nThe system will be deployed at sea.  Simultaneous validation will be conducted using other commercial radiation measuring devices and profilers, and water sampling and analysis; coordination with overhead assets (MERIS, MODIS) will provide additional measurements for complete validation of the AquaTree performance and closure for the radiative transfer modeling.  \nThe proposed work is synergistic and complementary to other oceanic research work at OKSI; including the AquaScanUVNIR-micro, an airborne hyperspectral scanner.  Both the AquaScan and AquaTree cover the 350-1000 nm spectral range.  The AquaScan will be flying in on manned platform and also on NASA UAV in support of ocean color, benthic diversity, biomass, and productivity of seagrass and coral reef biomes research.  Another project is exploring a low-cost space access for a HyperScan-micro on board a CubeSat.  Hyperspectral measurements over a long horizontal path are also conducted by OKSI to extract littoral aerosols properties.",

        "abstract": "Nearly all mechanism applications require some form of gearbox.  Wet lubricated gearbox technologies are limited to the relatively narrow temperature ranges of their lubricants.\n\nDry lubricated gearboxes have proven to be problematic with poor life and reliability characteristics.  Testing has shown that dry lubricated rolling elements can be made to work reliably provided they are operated at conservative contact stresses, however when dry film lubrications are tested under the sliding conditions in conventional transmissions they are no longer reliable. \n\nDuring the Phase I SBIR Rocketstar Robotics developed the preliminary design of a transmission that consists of all rolling elements and has eliminated all of the sliding elements that exist in conventional gearing.  The transmission operates at contact stress values that are conservative and within the envelope proven through previous testing to provide reliable performance in rolling elements.  The resulting transmission can be provided in a range of sizes and offers considerable torque capability within a reasonable envelope while operating within conservative rolling contact stress regimes at operating temperatures from near absolute zero to over 500C.\n\nThe development and test of a successful prototype could revolutionize the torque transmission industry and open the door to mechanisms operations over a much broader temperature range than is now possible.   Rocketstar Robotics proposes that the design be carried through the detailed design phase which includes detailed analysis models and that multiple prototypes be built of two different size transmissions.  The units would then be tested for performance and life over the extremes of temperature from near cryogenic to 500C operation.\n\nRocketstar will build 3 small 100 in-lb units and 3 large 400 in-lb units for testing along with spare splines to allow development testing with multiple DFL types.  One of each unit will be delivered to NASA.",

        "abstract": "Ship superstructures are increasingly being constructed from marine-grade aluminum alloys (5XXX-series) because they are lightweight and strong. However, sensitized 5XXX series alloys are vulnerable to inter-granular corrosion which manifests itself as stress corrosion cracking (SCC) and exfoliation corrosion, and it is virtually inevitable that the aluminum will become sensitized under normal operating conditions.. Stress corrosion cracking is particularly threatening because crack initiation and growth can be driven by stresses that are far lower tha those for normal gross failure. The primary objective of this SBIR project is to develop an innovative anticorrosion protective coating additive that affords significantly better resistance to stress corrosion cracking and exfoliation corrosion than current technologies. In the Phase II we will optimize, test, and transition a new coating additive that prevents corrosion in Series 5XXX aluminum alloys in a marine environment. In the Phase I we identified several organic molecules which were able to stop stress corrosion cracking on sensitized 5000 series aluminum. These organic molecules can be incorporated into TDA&quot;s proprietary carrier material and added to existing coatings to provide lasting active corrosion protection in a coating via its unique delivery system. In the Phase II project we will optimize the composition of the corrosion inhibitor additive composition and its use in marine shipbuilding coatings.",

It will be necessary for refractive corrector elements to be placed between the aerodynamic dome and the seeker optical system. We plan to manufacture a corrector element that is a bilaterally symmetric arch with aspheric terms using a suite of manufacturing technologies. These include ultrasonic assisted microgrinding, high speed VIBE polishing and deterministic sub-aperture polishing. The material chosen for the corrector optic is difficult to produce aspheric components due to its incompatibility with sub-aperture polishing techniques.

Due to the growing popularity of FPGAs and to the sensitive information programmed into them, it is important to find ways to safeguard the designs programmed into them from reverse engineering. Optimally, several layers of protection would be employed, so that even if an exploiter successfully penetrated one or more levels of protection, they would still find that the design was protected. The goal of this effort is to dramatically reduce the EM emanations from the FPGA, hiding the design from reverse engineering exploits using EM emanations.

In particular, noise created by the combustion process presents a problem due to its relatively low frequency. Low frequency noise propagates efficiently through the atmosphere resulting in audible detectability at unacceptable range. Low frequency noise can be reduced using passive silencing techniques, but these devices are typically large and heavy and present objectionable integration burdens.  This effort outlines activities to develop and demonstrate a prototype active noise cancellation (ANC) system on a representative 10 kW class APU in representative laboratory conditions.  Development activities include controller and amplifier design and development as well integration and development activities of the mechanicla components of the system.  Considerable durability testing, thermal performance characterization, and noise cancellation perfromance evaluation and tuning are included.  Successful execution of this effort will result in an ANC system for engine exhaust that matures the technology to a TRL level of 5, enabling selection of a demonstration platform to further elevate technological maturity and TRL level.",

High cycle temperature requirements in Air Force advanced fighter engines require advanced thermal protection systems on turbomachinery.  Currently unavailable to the Air Force and their prime advanced engine manufacturer is the needed capability for real-time verification that the in-service thermal barrier coating (TBC) allows high cycle temperatures and conserves component durability life.  Therefore, the transition objective is to advance the SBIR technology through product development to result in a functional high-speed, high-resolution thermal imaging system for TBC surface temperature mapping and condition monitoring during ground-based development testing of advanced gas turbine engines.  The Air Force and their prime advanced engine manufacturer will gain the significant information from within operational engines where the combined thermomechanical stresses are severe, as are the consequences of failure.  The transition effort will result in a high level of technology maturation, provide the Air Force with new measurement capability, and position the technology and product for commercialization.    BENEFIT:  This project will result in a product that will benefit the military and military aircraft industry and also find dual use by benefiting the commercial aircraft industry and power generation industry that utilize gas turbine engines. Engine development programs will be expedited thus bringing new engines to production sooner. The product could also be used on production engines as a condition/fault monitor for improved safety and reduced maintenance.",

        "abstract": "This Phase II SBIR proposal is submitted to address the need for high-power narrow spectral linewidth diode laser pump sources in alkali vapor lasers.  Diode-pumped alkali vapor lasers (DPALs) can be most efficiently pumped with spectrally-stabilized laser diode arrays (LDAs) with very narrow linewidths (a few GHz).  This allows DPAL operation at lower pressure and increased efficiency due to optimized absorption of the pump energy.  With an efficient pump source, DPALs have the potential for scaling to kilowatt (KW) or megawatt (MW) power levels for industrial and military applications.  A major hurdle to achieving this has been the availability of high-power narrow spectral linewidth laser diode sources.      In Phase I, Photodigm demonstrated a new method for diode laser stabilization based on emergent Guided-Mode Resonant Filter (GMRF) mirror technology.  These mirrors possess both wavelength and angular selectivity with narrowband spectral linewidths approaching 1 GHz.  GMRF mirrors are presented as an enabling technology to realize scalable narrow-linewidth wavelength-stabilized laser diode pump sources for DPAL applications.  These GMR-stabilized laser array modules are expected to operate at output power levels of approximately 100 Watts per bar.  The proposed high-power pump sources have key industrial and medical applications including laser machining and spin-exchange optical pumping.",

In light of continuing training resource and budgetary constraints, there has been interest on the part of the USN to investigate the potential for increased flight simulator utilization for aircraft carrier landing training. In particular, there is initial interest in augmenting F-18 Fleet Replacement Squadron (FRS) carrier qualification (CQ) training which accounts for the largest CQ training requirement. Current F-18 flight simulators do not support CQ training due to a lack of fidelity, particularly with regard to visual display capabilities and aircraft motion representation. In order to advance flight simulator capabilities such that they may support future CQ training, it will be necessary to investigate current simulator fidelity shortfalls and determine the necessary upgrades. In support of that objective the current effort proposes to: (1) develop objective measures of pilot performance during aircraft carrier landings; (2) design experiments to assess the impact of varying levels of simulator fidelity on pilot performance during aircraft carrier landings; and (3) to collect objective data to identify the appropriate level of simulator fidelity required for CQ training.",

        "abstract": "This effort considers the problem of Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC) using multiple asynchronous sensors in non-cooperative environments under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes. The goal is to improve and demonstrate the performance of AMC systems on various weak signal scenarios in a multi-cast environment that a traditional single sensor would not be able to readily classify. Candidate approaches involve both distributed decision fusion as well as centralized data fusion of asynchronous sensor data for multi-hypothesis modulation classification. This effort will build upon the results of a prior phase study, where the asymptotic behavior of distributed modulation classification systems was analyzed and conditions under which asymptotic probability of error goes to zero were derived. Upper and lower bounds for probability of error were derived based on Chernoff and Bhattacharyya error exponents and Monte Carlo sampling techniques. The optimal fusion rule for multi-hypothesis testing was developed and comparisons were carried out with the majority fusion rule. A maximum likelihood based centralized fusion problem was also formulated where each sensor experiences a different SNR and the network is asynchronous, i.e. each sensor has a non-identical phase, frequency and timing offset. In this effort, a novel centralized data fusion algorithm with multiple asynchronous sensors will be developed. The problem of asynchronous sensor data fusion for AMC using multiple sensors is considered untapped. A novel Distributed Automatic Modulation Classification (DAMC) technology and innovative approach are presented that exploits asynchronous multiple sensor data in the most effective way possible for this purpose. For distributed fusion, the proposed technology, based on a theoretical understanding of independence and dependence (Copula theory), will enable the development of novel fusion methodologies for maximized classification performance. Additionally, for time critical applications, sequential classification procedures will be explored. Time and computational complexity are also considered in proposed algorithms in view of limited computational resources. New algorithms will be developed and existing ones will be enhanced in this phase, along with trials for distributed signal sensing. Classification hardware prototypes will be tested and a robustness test of the new methods will be presented. The development of real-time software implementing this system will be produced and demonstrated. The completion of this phase will result in a mature DAMC technology, which will be inserted into selected hardware and undergo operational tests with real world signal transmission and reception in a fully functional, distributed sensor network.",

        "abstract": "During the Phase I SBIR project funded by DLA, Fairmount Technologies (FT) has developed and proven a new CNC metal forming  process called stretch roll forming (SRF) that can produce complex parts made out of extrusions without part-specific dies. The proofof-  concept machine developed has stretch formed flat and T-section extrusions to geometry similar to that of aircraft parts.  Recognizing the potential for this process to enable revolutionary manufacturing improvements, improve part quality, and save cost,  Cessna Aircraft Co. and Spirit Aerospace, have worked with FT to identify part families and the manufacturing lines in which to  introduce the process, as well as requirements for successful forming of aircraft parts. In this Phase II project, FT proposes to design  and build a prototype machine to meet these requirements and move the SRF process from a TRL of 3 to TRL 7. With our partners  input, with the insights gained from further improvements to the proof-of-concept machine, by recruiting additional development  partners with complementary expertise, and by making the best use of phase II funds, FT will build a prototype SRF machine and  demonstrate that SRF can form parts to accurate geometry and with favorable properties.",

This increased pressure rating will both benefit the NOAA Diving Program, by allowing treatment of divers to U.S. Navy Table 6A applications, and increase the commercialization potential of the resulting chamber design, since a 165 fsw chamber is of interest to the U.S. Navy, U.S. Coast Guard, and other organizations.  In Phase II, we will also complete the design drawings and specifications for the chamber, acquire the materials for, and fabricate, a prototype of the multi-occupant, flexible, hyperbaric chamber which will then be tested to ensure the prototype can meet the requirements of the ASME Pressure Vessels for Human Occupancy National Standard (PVHO-1 and proposed Case JJ), and the U.S. Navy Diving and Hyperbaric Safety and Certification Standards.  We anticipate the delivered prototype will become the first of three (minimum) pressure vessels that must remain intact during the prototype testing to meet the PVHO standards, giving PCCI a firm foundation for product commercialization.

        "abstract": "With the growing concerns surrounding security and terrorism around the world, biometrics has become one of the premier solutions to combat these problems. Traditionally, biometrics has been an academic problem that has been studied from the perspective of optimal environments (good lighting, cooperative subjects, single-frontal-2D / 3D photographs, etc.) and unlimited time and processing power. This form of biometric signature is considered&quot;cooperative&quot;and is generally not applicable to the more difficult problem of&quot;real-world&quot;recognition.  Non-cooperative feature recognition is an important component to tracking as a method of distinguishing between tracking targets.  Tracking and location determination can be accomplished easily on static platforms with controlled backgrounds and camera calibration, but has shown to be significantly more challenging on a mobile UAV platform. Innovative research is required to identify&quot;non-cooperative&quot;techniques that can be developed for implementation under modern battlefield conditions.  In this proposal, we present a variety of algorithms and methods to perform tagging, tracking, and locating (TTL) imagery platforms and sensor payloads.  We will leverage our prior SBIR and academic experience in this area, fusing remote biometric feature extraction with state-of-the-art image alignment, to tag, track, and locate long-range, non-cooperative targets on diverse video sensor input.",

Our main goal during Phase I was to show that a Star Camera attitude solution can achieve the pointing accuracy required by this topic.  During this Phase I we not only showed that our solution can achieve the pointing accuracy required, but that XACT can surpass this goal by a wide margin.     The Blue Canyon Technologies solution provides a reliable, high-performance design compatible with a variety of cubesat configurations.   The BCT XACT architecture leverages a powerful processing core with BCT&quot;s micro-Reaction Wheel Assemblies to enable a new generation of highly capable, miniaturized spacecraft.    Features include the following:   Precise attitude control &amp; knowledge    Complete ADCS in a Micro &amp; #8208;package (0.5U)   Low jitter micro-reaction wheel design   User friendly software for simulation, integration, and customization    BENEFIT:  Pointing performance is the key to the commercial potential of XACT.  The cubesat market has been largely dominated by low-cost and low-performance components that can be used for a limited set of missions.  This product will enable cubesats to point with much higher accuracy than any available cubesat attitude control system, and this will allow for a much larger number of mission possibilities.  BCT believes that the market potential for cubesats will grow with this corresponding growth in missions.  XACT will be ahead of the competition due to this Phase II investment from AFRL, and will be the leader in the market for high-performance cubesat missions.  The market size for microsatellites is expected to be $1.5 billion by 2018 according to Business 2.0 marketing estimates, and BCT believes that a large majority of this market can be captured by cubesats if their performance can be increased.",

        "abstract": "Developing faster more efficient processing methods for the fabrication of large sapphire windows has the potential to reduce their overall cost. The hardness of the material as well as its crystallographic orientation results in low material removal rates that lead to processing times longer than desired. These low removal rates are present in both the grinding and polishing phases of the process and are one of the primary cost drivers. By increasing the material removal rate during fabrication without distorting the optical wavefront, substantial cost savings can be achieved. OptiPro Systems has the unique opportunity to develop a deterministic mid-aperture sized polishing (USF) UltraSmooth Finishing process. This process will have the ability to remove material at a rapid rate, and use metrology data as input for controlling the wavefront of the sapphire window. OptiPro&quot;s technologically advanced optical manufacturing capabilities along with a support partnership with Ted Turnquist from Meller Optics, an expert in sapphire processing, gives us a very strong team, and a clear path towards solving the difficult problems associated with reducing the grinding and finishing costs associated with manufacturing sapphire windows.",

        "abstract": "Despite its sensitivity to diverse shape, surface, and material properties, laser polarimetry is one of the primary remaining remote-sensing modalities yet to be effectively utilized.  The traditional limitations of laser polarimetry in a field sensor have been 1) making efficient use of multi-dimensional polarimeter data, and 2) achieving required sensor footprint and speed.  Phase 1 demonstrated automated target recognition (ATR) algorithms based on mission-specific laser-polarimeter data that achieve significant performance improvements over algorithms based on non-polarized laser data.  In particular, these algorithms achieve target pose invariance and low false-alarm rate (FAR).  These algorithms, generally termed polarization-components techniques (PCT), overcome the first limitation to fielding a polarimetric ATR sensor.  The PCT algorithms also minimize measurement requirements, thereby guiding the design of partial Mueller matrix polarimeters (pMMP), which represent a significant step in overcoming the second limitation.  The Phase 2 program will finalize and build a conceptual pMMP design and apply the resulting field polarimeter to mission-specific field tests.  Future commercialization efforts will be supported by a field polarimeter available for demonstrations of general-purpose ATR and by the next generation PCT test and simulation software to be developed and utilized in the Phase 2 program.",

Our solution to this problem is the Compact Aerial Video Exploitation (CAVE) integrated hardware/software system designed to process high-resolution video data at full video-rate onboard a small UAV. The software performs feature-aided tracking, such that only narrow-bandwidth results need to be transmitted back to the user, and employs a revolutionary computing hardware architecture that our Phase 1 analysis indicates will run the CAVE tracker ~90 times faster than a CPU alone while using ~72 times less power, thus yielding a ~6400x improvement in speed/power overall. As a result, feature-aided tracking can be executed with great speed and energy efficiency on the novel architecture, proving its value and viability for enabling valuable ISR processing onboard small UAVs. During Phase II, we will develop a full-scope CAVE prototype using emulated hardware and optimized tracking software. We will extend CAVE&quot;s ISR capabilities to include target detection, multiple target tracking, and other related algorithms.",

Phase II will continue the research, produce prototype intermediate band solar cells, and develop a manufacturing plan for high efficiency, low cost solar cells. The most efficient solar cells developed so far use thin film layers of engineered materials to create multi-junction cells that harvest photons over a wide solar spectrum. However, these multi-junction cells require ultra-purity materials and expensive processing. Alternatively, preliminary research now indicates that intermediate band solar cells should have the distinction of achieving the highest conversion efficiency. Radiation Monitoring Devices intends to develop intermediate band thin film solar cells with a single light-harvesting layer that will efficiently absorb light over the same wide solar spectrum. This layer of photosensitive material will be grown in a structured form on large-area substrates using RMD&quot;s established methods that ensure consistent, reliable fabrication and reduce manufacturing costs. The novel morphology of the resulting material will foster highly efficient light capture due to its increased effective surface area and acceptance angle, and enhance charge collection at the electrodes.",

However, hydrogen storage and handling is a problem. Direct oxidation fuel cell (DOFC) with a PEM is a quite attractive alternative. However, due to slow reduction and oxidation kinetics in the acidic media and fuel crossover issue, those systems have not reached their full potentials. It is well known that electrochemical oxidation of fuel and electrochemical reductions of oxygen are kinetically more favorable in an alkaline media at low temperature (T&lt;100oC). Furthermore, alkaline electrolyte offers the best prospects for using non-noble metal as the catalyst. Recent reports showed promising results for alkaline fuel cell based on hydroxyl exchange membrane (HEM). However, due to limited availability and low performance of such membranes, a lot of development work is still urgently needed in order to pave the way for developing high energy density AFCs.   A novel HEM has been successfully synthesized and validated in the Phase I program. In this Phase II program, the membrane formula and process will be further optimized. Meanwhile, the manufacturing process will be developed in order to produce the membrane in a continuous coating line. At the completion of the program, a novel HEM, with the following advantages, 1) high ionic conductivity; 2) excellent thermal stability; 3) much better chemical and electrochemical stability; 4) low cost and 5) excellent manufacturability, will be successfully developed and independently validated. This innovative HEM will meet the stringent requirements as the membrane material for both hydrogen based AFC and direct oxidation AFCs.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project investigates the viability of an electrochemical device for separation and compression of hydrogen from low-pressure mixed gas streams that are critical for industrial gas and energy applications. Previous studies have shown that hydrogen derived from reformation of hydrocarbons produces a gas stream rich in CO2, CO and H2. It has been well- documented that low-temperature electrodes similar to those used in these devices are often contaminated by carbon monoxide, negatively affecting their operation. While state-of-the-art solutions rely upon implementation of advanced catalysts or high temperature membranes, these solutions are not viable for systems having significant levels of CO in the feed stream. Specifically the project will focus on solving electrode contamination issues through a series of design modifications; allowing the system to operate continually at high efficiency. Research efforts will leverage results from a fluids transport model to optimize the cell and system design. Laboratory cells will be constructed and evaluated over a range of operational parameters to develop a better understanding of the performance improvement associated with this approach. This program will culminate in the construction of a fully-integrated system package that will be tested and validated with real-world reformate chemistries. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project relates to the fact that depletion of fossil fuel reserves and a global requirement for the development of a sustainable economy, the prospect of hydrogen-based energy is of growing importance. Production, purification and compression of hydrogen represent key technical challenges for the implementation of a hydrogen economy, especially in the transportation sector where new sources and modes of delivery of hydrogen are needed. These technologies must be robust, efficient, and cost effective in order to have value in meeting our energy needs. Since hydrogen energy markets are emerging, viable product solutions must meet near-term industrial needs as a commercial bridge toward low-cost energy products. The current market for hydrogen is large and growing, with the vast majority of hydrogen produced from hydrocarbon sources resulting in gas streams containing appreciable quantities of CO and CO2 and hydrogen. Current methods for separation and compression of hydrogen are very expensive and these costs are passed to the end-user. Successful development of the proposed technology will integrate the separation and compression functions, and expand the applicability of this device to separation of reformate and other mixed gas streams in a low-cost configuration which offers significant commercial appeal.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to develop a novel molten salt for solar thermal power generation with supercritical steam turbines. Solar thermal technology developers must increase the operating temperature of their plants to lower their levelized cost of electricity and reduce the cost of thermal storage. Building upon a successful Phase I program, the project team has developed a prototype salt mixture that could enable this trend. It is low cost, exhibits a melting point below 240 deg. C, and has a high maximum temperature of 700 deg. C, a broad operating range currently unavailable elsewhere. The project will conduct a high throughput R &amp; D program to rapidly screen up to thousands of unique mixtures of inorganic salts to optimize the physical properties of the prototype fluid. The project will apply combinatorial chemistry techniques, originally developed for pharmaceutical applications, to this new field. After screening many candidates, the project will evaluate the materials compatibility of a few promising mixtures with common steel and nickel-based alloys. Corrosion mitigation techniques will be developed and evaluated. The project will conduct flow testing in a lab-scale test loop capable of 700 deg. C operation. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be the enabling of low-cost electricity from the sun. It is imperative that society reduce its usage of fossil fuels (oil, natural gas, coal) to address pressing concerns - climate change and environmental degradation, energy security, and price volatility. Solar thermal power, a compelling source of renewable electricity at large scale, is the most promising solution to reduce fossil fuel use. However, electricity from solar thermal power currently costs too much to be directly competitive with fossil fuels. Furthermore, solar thermal plants need a cheap way to store heat in order to produce power after sundown or when utilities demand it. This project focuses on the material at the heart of these plants - the heat transfer fluid - and thermal storage system. The market for thermal storage is projected to reach $3.7 billion by 2015. Thermal storage is growing increasingly valuable as utilities realize the need for solar power that can deliver smooth, reliable output regardless of weather conditions. The development of the proposed innovation would both reduce the cost of solar thermal power and enable economical thermal storage, bringing the nation significantly closer to eliminating the use of coal.",

Educational video games are the next generation of technology-enhanced instruction, with a growing body of research suggesting that game-based learning helps students think systemically, collaboratively, and creatively about Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM), while creating interest and motivation toward these topics that extends beyond the classroom. The company targets middle school since this is the critical period when students may begin to disengage from STEM topics. The process of developing the games will include iterative input from educators and students from around the country, from focus groups to classroom observation. The efficacy of the resulting set of games will be evaluated in a formal field test. This test will also provide evidence of the value of UDL in designing educational technology tools. The resulting product will be available for purchase via the SBIR?s web store and distributed through the nation?s leading educational websites. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the development of a cutting-edge solution to a urgent need for more effective tools for teaching STEM subjects. The President&#039;s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology recently noted (2010) that while the United States remains at the top in STEM research, we are on the cusp of a stark decline over the next generation. American students are falling behind other countries in both STEM-related abilities and desire to enter scientific careers. By creating a game-centered physical science curriculum, teachers gain the tools they need to make STEM-subjects accessible and appealing to all students, building the next-generation&#039;s STEM workforce, and promoting scientific literacy among all citizens. Using the UDL framework and commercial-level production values, GIPS represents an important innovative to engage and empower students, including those who are disenfranchised by traditional STEM education methods. Indeed, advocates for students with disabilities point to the potential of UDL-enhanced games to increase the accessibility of learning materials for all students. This game-based learning solution will encourage students to apply the kind of creative thinking and ingenuity to STEM that will be the driving force behind the next generation of American scientific innovation.",

        "abstract": "For more than a decade there has been interest in behavioral language entry and translation to hardware description languages (HDL) for field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). This has culminated in a wide array of electronic design automated (EDA) tools that can translate high level languages, such as C/C++ and their variants, to HDL. Largely driven by the EDA industry, these prior tools have been expensive, difficult to use, and generally requiring expert knowledge. As such, there has been, and continues to be, a wall between algorithms designers and code entry into FPGAs. Work in this proposed effort seeks to dramatically change this paradigm by focusing on FPGA entry based on industry-standard MATLAB. By combining this with Toyon supplied radio development platforms, supporting software, tutorials, and other documentation, we seek to provide a unified development environment for designing wireless communication systems. Furthermore, because the development flow is well integrated with other existing tools, such as Simulink HDL Coder and MATLAB C/C++ Coder, the approach is extensible and portable across different processor and FPGA families. Similarly, the approach is flexible in that any radio vendor can leverage the toolset in a general fashion.",

These collection tools build upon the current sample processing platform by providing three unique biofluid collection, processing and preservation solutions, each containing the Ceres patented and specifically optimized Nanotrap particles and affinity baits.  The Nanotrap-enabled collection tools will consist of: 1) dried biofluid collection paper substrates for low volume blood samples having proven feasibility demonstrated during Phase I of this SBIR program; 2) urine collection cups containing a new version of magnetic Nanotrap particles that separate targeted analytes from solution allowing the analytes to be stored and shipped within the magnetic lid; and 3) blood collection tubes for larger volume blood collection, providing the ability to immediately collect and protect low-abundance clinical analytes from samples stored or transported at ambient temperature.  The purpose of developing this toolkit is to not only provide a method for improved sample preservation of low volume biofluid samples, but to also take advantage of all the key feature of the Nanotrap particles, which allow for enrichment of low-abundance analytes, exclusion of high-abundance proteins, and the ability to capture and protect analytes from a wide range of biofluid samples.",

        "abstract": "Today, various mobile robots have already demonstrated their effectiveness in Afghanistan and Iraq, especially in standoff EOD operations. However, the current limitations are that: 1) they are too expensive to be widely distributed across the theaters in order to protect small dismounted units, 2) they lack truly reliable sensors to speedily identify IEDs with a tolerable false alarm rate, and 3) they do not support practical intelligent behaviors in order to expedite IEDD operations. To address these technological challenges, we propose to develop the SNIP, a low-cost robotic IED defeat package to be widely utilized by small dismounted units and help them expedite their operations. The main elements of the proposed SNIP system are: a) Intelligent Behavior Engine: an integrated software framework that supports the development, simulation and control of intelligent behaviors; b) a mid-sized mobile robot platform equipped with various onboard navigation sensors, cameras, etc., together with an OCU designed to provide efficient operator situational awareness; c) a state-of-art IED detection sensor, which will be enhanced during the Phase II effort; and d) effective, low cost defeat mechanism. SNIP is envisioned to provide a high performance solution for IED detection and neutralization in a cost effective package.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  In today&quot;s warfare, accurate payload placement is necessary to maintain the tactical advantage we have been fostering throughout our history.  Continuing evolution in air to ground mission objectives has brought new opportunities to technologically evolve the state of the art in accurate air drop capabilities.  The CPADS effort is a significant opportunity to develop a new solution for accurate payload placement.  This opportunity also brings new very relevant challenges in increased mechanical modularity, increased operational autonomy, and decreased system level cost.  SeaLandAire Technologies together with its team member CH Robotics researched the development of a tandem wing glider as a solution to the military&quot;s aerial delivery performance gap.  Our proposed approach is an autonomous, covert glider designed to deliver payloads to the ground with a high degree of accuracy. Its novelty lies in the operational simplicity achieved through the use of a self-contained custom autopilot and mission planner, the repeatable and safe payload delivery obtained using stall and parachute maneuvers, and the high amount of accuracy achieved with a sophisticated autopilot path planner and a unique parachute reefing system.  A glider-based solution has a number of advantages over other methods, including decreased cost, and increased payload, covertness, and landing accuracy.  BENEFIT:  This Phase II program will culminate in a hardware demonstration for our proposed covert precision aerial delivery system (ADS).  The program will prove the original technical feasibility studies established in the Phase I effort.  The focus of the Phase II program is to prove the performance of the proposed CPADS system referenced to the original solicitation requirements.  With this information, the ability of the CPADS to provide the needed supplies and sensors to ground forces and specific locations will be demonstrated.    Specifically, the development of the low cost autopilot system can positively effect future R &amp; D in the continued development unmanned aerial systems, ground vehicles, and autonomous surface vehicles.  Currently autopilot technology that is available on the market, from suppliers such as Microbotics and Procerus, can be prohibitively expensive for initial research and development effortsspecifically phase I SBIR efforts.  Providing the market with a lower cost version could have significant implications on the continued development of these critical fields.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The objectives of the proposed research effort is to provide a comprehensive measurements and modeling tools to understand the physics and chemistry associated with burning phenomenon near the turbine surface for various cooling hole configurations.   Current state-of-the-art measurements and modeling tools are inadequate in addressing the issues related to burning phenomenon near the turbine surface. The measurements, modeling, and new cooling configurations are geared toward addressing the following issues:   1. Quantify the conditions that result in \"burning in the turbine.\"    2. Quantitatively determining the effects of various cooling-hole configurations in preventing or reducing the heat release related to the secondary combustion near the turbine blade.  3. Identifying the areas that needed to be cooled based on a 2D measurement of temperature and heat-release rates near the turbine blade.   4. Identifying coolant delivery methods to the needed areas as guided by quantitative measurements of temperature and species concentrations.  5. Validating that coolant maintains vane at acceptable temperatures without burning.  Successful demonstration of these measurements and the 3D modeling during the Phase-II research effort will allow us to address the issues related to \"burning phenomenon in the turbine\" in great detail.  The goal of the research program is to establish a sufficient understanding for the development of turbine-cooling schemes that enable the application of the UCC/ITB or the development of advanced cooling systems for future war-fighter systems.  BENEFIT:  The proposed research effort will provide new diagnostic and modeling capabilities that will enable the Air Force and gas-turbine-system manufacturers to address the challenges associated with the development of compact combustors and their integration with turbines. These tools are critical for the development and long-term health of propulsion systems for high-performance military as well as for commercial systems.  The proposed research will also help to advance the state-of-the-art turbine-cooling technology by quantitatively identifying various factors that lead to burning in the turbine and then by designing innovative cooling configurations for preventing burning near the turbine blades.  Quantitative measurements are critical for validating numerical models of reacting and non-equilibrium phenomena affecting modern gas-turbine and hypersonic propulsion systems.  The proposed experimental and numerical tools will enable analysis of military and commercial gas-turbine combustors, as well as of applications with limited optical access such as internal combustion engines and stationary power-generation systems.",

        "abstract": "Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing (Deaf/hh) persons rely heavily on facial movements for communication, whether in American Sign Language (ASL), Signed English (SE), or Spoken English. In ASL, signers add \u201cmouth morphemes\u201d, similar to speech movements, to signs to distinguish concepts that use the same manual sign. Hard-ofhearing persons who use spoken communication, read mouth shapes to distinguish similar sounds. Existing animations of facial expressions and speech fall short of addressing the full range of \u201cvisible speech\u201d and mouth morphemes. Our Phase I work shows that users of\nour animated sign language products want to see animated signing with enhanced mouth movement; and there is evidence that this can enhance comprehension.\nFor this Phase II SBIR project, Vcom3D will develop comprehensive models of mouth movements used in ASL and speech, as well as software tools to animate these movements. To evaluate their effectiveness, Vcom3D and TERC will evaluate the animations in mobile versions of our Signing Math Pictionary (SMP), which provides ASL and SE definitions of math terms for K-3 learners. While the SMP will be the first application of the technology, Phase II research and tools will be broadly applicable to future products using animation to promote inclusion of Deaf/HH students.",

        "abstract": "This proposal addresses the Army&quot;s requirements outlined in the solicitation for an efficient and portable water decontamination technology to achieve optimum water re-use for field operations by reducing contaminant levels in the wash, rinse and discharge streams of the mobile kitchen sanitation center. An effective approach is the use of ozone, a powerful oxidizing gas capable of broadly neutralizing harmful species in gaseous and aqueous forms. In particular, microplasma-based ozone generation technology can be adapted for portable water-purification and the removal of toxic contaminants. Microplasmas are attractive due to the high reactivity of the excited species. The primary components of the proposed system are a microplasma ozone generator and a multichannel gas-liquid micro-reactor for ozonolysis. The microplasma ozone generator has the potential for high conversion rates of air to ozone and the micro-reactor offers high mass transfer and reactivity for decontamination of wastewater with low power consumption in a compact and easily scalable modular design. The Phase I effort has demonstrated the effectiveness of ozone to provide the highly efficient and adaptable decontamination technology required by the Army and this proposal illustrates a roadmap for further development of the integrated system for a comprehensive solution for the Army&quot;s needs.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this SBIR project is to develop a rotorcraft acoustic solver that can treat long distance propagation through general, realistic environments. Only a Finite Difference Time Domain approach is capable of treating propagation through general inhomogeneous media, and only be considered outside the inner region (near the rotorcraft). However, the range limitation precludes the use of conventional formulations. This problem can easily be overcome by a new method, Wave Confinement (WC), developed by the proposed principal investigator. The basic idea of WC is first to extend the basic linearized Euler pde, by adding a nonlinear confinement term. This term results in thin stable, propagating structures, whose centroids propagate exactly as the pulses of the original unenhanced pdes. Also, the total amplitude, integrated along a ray, with geometric (azimuthal) spreading taken into account, is conserved. The difference is that pulse computed with WC has a profile defined by the computational method and not by the original, physical pulse profile. With WC (as with shock capturing methods), the important quantities involve conserved integrals through the thin shock, or pulse and the centroid location, but not profile. In addition, WC can treat reflections from obstacles in a very simple way.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  During Phase I, SES modeled the fuel consumption of a baseline shelter and then modeled the interactive effects of using fuel efficient technologies (lighting, climate control, etc.) instead of the baseline technologies.  This work demonstrated the feasibility of improving the fuel efficiency of shelters by more than 50%, by combining several innovative commercial off the shelf (COTS) technologies.  To validate this result, comparative testing of shelters is required, with and without relevant technologies, in a laboratory environment.  The Phase I model shows that climate control accounts for up to 75% of fuel used in the baseline shelter.  Building envelope (insulation, etc.) technologies can reduce this use of energy.  In Phase II, SES will develop and demonstrate a shelter laboratory, and will use it to develop, optimize and demonstrate a prototype deployable shelter envelope kit.  The kit will include multiple building envelope systems, packaged to make the installation and use of this optimized combination of envelope technologies easy for shelter users.  The lab will be used to show that the kit can save 15  30% of shelter fuel, and to demonstrate, on a proof of concept basis, that additional technologies can be added to achieve the original 50% fuel reduction target.  BENEFIT:  If successful, this Phase II R &amp; D will result in the availability, for the first time, of a demonstrated, optimized, shelter envelope system that combines existing technologies in an innovative way so as to enable shelter users to reduce their fuel use by 15  30%, without loss of any relevant functionality, including no loss of interior space.  Military users will have an immediate interest in using this system, to reduce fuel costs and the risks associated with the delivery of fuel in deployed situations.  Commercial markets are also expected to exist.  The size of mobile buildings, whether purpose-built or made from retrofitted shipping containers, is fixed by the standardized size of roads and transportation equipment.   Therefore, similar mobile buildings used by other government and private sector entities also have restricted interior space, and, therefore, the envisioned kit would be suitable for use with most mobile buildings.  Some users of mobile buildings, such as mineral exploration companies, scientific research organizations, remote telecommunications infrastructure maintenance, and so forth, deploy the buildings to very remote locations.  By their nature, such locations do not have established energy delivery infrastructure.  Therefore, although not often as high as military fuel costs, the cost of fuel delivered to such remote locations is also very high.  All of these organizations, therefore, have a stronger interest in fuel efficiency than average mobile building users.  They would, therefore, also have an interest in retrofitting the mobile buildings they have purchased or leased for use in remote locations by using envisioned optimized mobile building envelope kit.  As the kits are put into large-scale production and costs come down, further markets can be expected to exist in less and less remote locations; it is possible that the kit may also find buyers in markets with established infrastructure that have high energy costs, such as towns in Alaska.",

        "abstract": "While many applications may have access to harvestable energy in the form of solar radiation (or other ambient light), wind, environmental vibration, or wave motion, not all do. In this proposal, RMD targets the most challenging applications, sensors that must operate for many months or years and which have undependable or no access to environmental energy. These sensors need a self contained, compact energy source that contains, at the outset, all the energy required for the length of the mission. We propose to provide this energy through the development of a novel beta battery, to convert the energy of long-lived beta emitters such as strontium 90 (29 years) into usable electrical power. Beta batteries have been known for fifty years, but have suffered from two shortcomings. First, radiation damage to the semiconductor junction used for the conversion limits either the lifetime of the device or the maximum allowable particle energy of the incident radiation. Second, absorption in the radioactive source limits the efficiency of the device. RMD proposes an innovative energy conversion method that resolves both of these issues and allows the development of higher power, higher efficiency beta batteries than were possible in the past.",

The significance of the problem is considerable, given the fact that many organizations (e.g., industry, military, and academia) continue to rely more and more on distributed teams and collaborative technology to accomplish tasks and goals. In response to this growing need, SA Technologies proposes to develop the first fully validated, domain-independent, diagnostic, and prescriptive subjective workload measure, which will be sensitive to different team configurations, from intact co-located teams, to ad-hoc distributed teams in any domain. SA Technologies will leverage its vast experience in the field and conduct a review of the current methods of appraising subjective workload in order to identify the common theoretical and practical limitations that need to be expanded upon and integrated into a coherent theoretical framework that will provide the basis for the development of a subjective workload measure for teams. Finally, SA Technologies will take a programmatic approach to empirically testing the measure with human subjects, via a distributed team testbed, in order to establish external validity by demonstrating scale sensitivity to various measures of effectiveness and measures of performance, thus establishing prescriptive value.",

This limits operational flexibility and increases logistical complexity and cost. SEA CORP has developed a family of impulse launchers that use COTS automotive air bag inflators that significantly expands the capability and flexibility of any single launcher design to employ a number of payloads. The inflators, widely used in the automotive industry, are small cylinders containing a highly compressed inert gas that is released when a small initiator is electrically actuated. By changing the number, size, and initiation timing of the inflators, the launcher can be adjusted to accommodate various payloads that have different impulse requirements. The technology was originally developed under a NAVSEA SBIR to launch light weight torpedoes up to 740lbs from surface ships. In the proposed application, SEA CORP will adapt the technology to provide the impulse energy to eject missiles from submerged submarines.",

Directly consuming a combination of a high energy density fuel (NaBH4) and concentrated liquid oxidizer (H2O2) directly rather than decomposing them into hydrogen and oxygen, then consuming them is a key to achieving much higher energy densities in a fuel cell based energy storage system.     In Phase I, Lynntech demonstrated that this type of direct fuel cell can produce an output greater than is theoretically possible in a gas fed fuel cell. This was accomplished by developing two classes of anion exchange membranes (AEMs) based on different commercially available backbones both of which contained a unique, highly stable functional group. In Phase II, Lynntech will optimize the synthesis of the polymers and evaluate the properties and performance of the membranes. The down selected composition will be scaled and demonstrated in both extensive single cell tests and in a short stack operating on aqueous NaBH4 and H2O2.",

The machined metal was dissolved in the electrolyte at 3000 ppm, and recovered using electrowinning in solid/metallic form devoid of hydrated oxides. In Phase II we will optimize the FARADAYICSM ECM and FARADAYICSM Electrowinning processes, build bench and pilot-scale facilities to validate the technology in a closed-loop system for steel, copper, nickel and cobalt chrome alloys, develop detailed quantification of the reduction in the sludge produced during recycled electrochemical machining, and design a process flow for implementation at an Army facility.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Small unmanned aerial vehicles are a useful military asset and new systems must provide greater endurance and stealthier operation.  A problem is that current propulsion options provide either long endurance (internal combustion) or quiet operation (electric) but not both.  Hybridization of the powertrain, incorporating both internal combustion and electric motor technology, has the potential to meet these demands; however, the complexity of its design and operation favors evaluation in the context of the aircraft and mission requirements.  For this reason, in Phase I, hybrid propulsion models were developed and integrated into an aircraft model to predict performance under a standardized flight profile.  Results indicated that the hybrid architecture was feasible, but that further component technology development would be required before endurance capabilities matched current capabilities.  A Phase II program is proposed to mature the hybrid propulsion system concept through performance simulation using detailed component data, system controller development, hardware-in-the-loop simulation of the system and controller, and a benchtop demonstration of system operation under a simulated mission profile using representative hardware.  The goal will be to demonstrate the operability of a hybrid propulsion system in a flight-like configuration to provide a solid foundation for further development of a flight-rated system.  BENEFIT:  The key contribution of a hybrid propulsion system is the capability to operate in a mode with the internal combustion engine off, reducing the operating noise of the aircraft until the energy storage system needs recharged using the internal combustion engine.  This period of reduced operating noise will improve the survivability of small aircraft in a battle zone by making these aircraft less detectable.  Since these aircraft operate at low altitudes, they are subjected to small arms fire, and do not have the weight capacity to carry armor to survive attacks, so reducing the detectability is the only option to improve their survivability.  The hybrid architecture and controller development and demonstration that will be performed during Phase II may be applied to a variety of small aircraft currently operated by the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps, as well as to small organically designed aircraft that will be used by these services in the future.",

MER&quot;s lithium-ion battery is highly suitable to fit in a limited volume but requires new materials to handle these harsh environmental conditions. In a Phase I, MER Corporation has successfully established a Li-ion battery chemistry using new electrodes and electrolyte materials that has enabled demonstration of new non-flammable Ah capacity Li-ion batteries, operational across a wide temperature range, from -50 degrees C to +65 degrees C while supplying power to heavy loads. Based on these results, in this Phase II we propose to design, fabricate and demonstrate 1Ah/26V modular Li-ion battery packs with enhanced temperature ranges extending from -55 degrees C to +85 degrees C. These battery packs will initially be evaluated in a soft case and then will be packaged as a hard case prototype. They will meet and surpass the JASSM safety performance test conditions.  Prototypes will be delivered to the Air Force/Prime Contractor at the end of the Phase II program.  BENEFIT:  Light weight, cost effective and safer high voltage Li-ion battery packs will replace the existing Ni-Cd battery packs, which are larger than desired and which have been failing quality testing due to cell problems. At the successful completion of this proposed Phase II, we will have an advanced and highly safe Li-ion battery pack for missile flight testing. This battery offers higher specific energy, longer life and better safety across a wider range of operational temperatures than the present state-of-the-art lithium-ion batteries and, therefore, will find a wide variety of military applications. The building block cells used for this modular design battery could also be used to power cellular phones to run power tools and notebooks or for hybrid electric vehicle applications.   MER&quot;s main goal is to develop a Li-ion power source that can handle severe temperature conditions. The proposed Li-ion battery, composed of novel materials and with an improved design can have higher energy density and power density with fast charge/discharge rates while operating under severe temerature conditions. Such capabilities will make these Li-ion batteries more practical for use in portable electronics, transportation vehicles, space exploration missions and aircraft propulsion systems as well as in any variable power demand application that requires a compact power source.

However, disadvantages of Re include high cost and high density. Alternatives to Re such as composites, refractory metal alloys, and monolithic ceramics have been proposed, but all possess strength, oxidation and/or cost limitations. Materials based on the Hf-Ta-N system have potential of meeting service temperature, oxidation resistance, and thermal shock requirements for advanced 2760 degrees C (5000 degrees F) DACS.  This potential was demonstrated during a Phase I effort where Plasma Processes established VPS parameters to fabricate dense specimens for characterization and oxidation evaluations. Oxidation studies identified a chemistry that demonstrated superior oxidation resistance. Though materials based on the Hf Ta N system appear promising, a methodical approach to material optimization and evaluation is warranted in order to sufficiently mature the technology for MDA system integration.  The technical objective of a Phase II effort is to execute a methodical approach to further develop the Hf-Ta-N system, with the goal ultimately identify optimum chemistries capable of replacing Re components of DACS systems with 50% cost savings and 30% weight savings.  Specific tasks will include processing optimization; characterization; oxidation studies; mechanical testing; and hot fire testing evaluations. This proposed material development effort will be directly beneficial to upgrades for SM-3, THAAD, Airborne Weapon Layer, Sea-based Terminal defense and various tactical missile systems.",

A typical semiconductor chip fabrication process involves hundreds of complex and expensive processing steps. With an increase in the number and complexity of process steps involved, it is of critical importance to detect defects early in the manufacturing process. Yield would be maximized if such detection is performed for each and every wafer without affecting throughput. Under this program an innovative in-line tool will be developed to rapidly detect macro defects on whole wafers by integrating inexpensive commercially-available hardware with sophisticated defect detection and classification algorithms. The tool will inspect every wafer and will have zero false positives. In Phase I, the feasibility of the proposed approach was conclusively demonstrated. In Phase II, a prototype of the defect detection and classification software and scanning hardware will be integrated into commercial wafer processing equipment, and its effectiveness will be demonstrated. The tool will have a major impact by reducing inspection cost and increasing yield. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is substantial. There is great potential in the semiconductor industry for an inexpensive tool for real-time detection and classification of macro defects right at the equipment where the defect is generated. The successful commercialization of the proposed defect detection tool will assist in significantly increasing manufacturing yields and thus lowering costs. The product will find use in several secondary markets such as solar energy devices, light emitting diodes, photonics, etc. Additionally, with strong relationships with several universities, summer internships will be provided to students from local universities, and the research findings will be presented at international conferences. Thus the proposed work will certainly impact academic research and training and there is a strong commitment to creating opportunities for women and minorities. Finally, microelectronics affects almost every aspect of our lives including wireless and mobile internet technology. Hence, a product that makes a significant contribution to lowering the cost of manufacturing integrated circuits will positively affect the society at large.",

As part of Phase I project, the internal calibration routine has been developed and its ?proof-of-concept? has been demonstrated on an implantable glucose sensor unit operating in porcine serum for a period of 3 weeks. Along these lines, a proximity communicator (wrist-watch like unit) has also been developed which is in operable communication with the implantable unit. Phase II aims to further enhance the reliability of this calibration routine by demonstrating its efficacy in an in vivo environment (rat model) along with advancement of the proximity communicator unit in order to establish a two-way communication with a smartphone capable of real time data processing and implementation of the internal calibration routine. At the end of Phase-II, the completion of developmental activities for the self-calibrating glucose monitoring platform is envisioned, thereby, bringing it a step closer to commercialization in the pre-clinical animal research market (first market of Biorasis Inc.) The broader/commercial impacts of this project are enormous considering that there is an urgent need for continuous glucose monitoring devices in view of the growing number of diabetic patients. Implantable glucose sensors that afford minimal user intervention present a viable alternative, although their ?user-independent? nature is often undermined by the need for frequent external calibration via painful finger-pricking.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will enable a completely new approach to biology. The fundamental unit of biology is the single cell, and each cell contains complex genetic machinery. Many fundamental questions could be answered if biologists could perform genetic analysis on large numbers of single cells derived from tissues. The vast majority of useful applications would require detection of multiple genetic loci in single cells. For example, immunologists would like to measure co-expression of multiple T cell receptors and inflammatory molecules in hundreds of thousands of single T cells circulating in human blood. Currently, biology lacks elegant tools to perform this type of analysis. The current project aims to solve this problem with an innovative approach for analysis multiple genetic loci in hundreds of thousands of single cells analyzed in parallel. The technology uses a device to isolate single cells into aqueous-in-oil picoliter microdroplets, amplifies and links two or more genetic loci by intermolecular hybridization, and then sequences linked loci in reversed emulsions by next-generation sequencing. This enables far more complicated biological analysis than is possible if analyzing only a single locus in a single cell, or a single locus across many single cells. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes commercial applications in genetics and immunology research as well as molecular diagnostics and pharmaceutical development. Immunology researchers worldwide are eager to understand T cell and B cell immune repertoires. Immune repertoires respond to factors such as infectious disease, age, and obesity, so immune repertoire profiling is of great interest worldwide. The innovation of this proposed research is to link subunits of antibody genes to reveal a more complete immune repertoire profile. A similar method could be used to link subunits of T cell receptor genes. The platform will also enable unique and innovative approaches to a number of currently intractable problems in molecular diagnostics, including noninvasive monitoring of immunotherapy, noninvasive monitoring of autoimmune disease, and inflammatory response to allograft procedures. Finally, T cells and antibodies are increasingly used as therapy for disease, and immune repertoire profiling technology will be critical to the development of such therapies. In summary, the technology developed in this project will be marketed to research immunologists, leading to fundamental improvements in our understanding of immunology. Eventually, the technology could be extended to the fields of molecular diagnostics and immune therapy, which could help cure intractable diseases.",

The multilingual Hybrid Question Answering (HQA) engine will change the way people access heterogeneous data by answering complex questions over semantic models from the database and free text from the search indexes of product literature, call center data, social media, etc. HQA will answer a broad range of questions including factoid, procedural, explanation and scenario-matching. Users will also be able to discover facts, relationships among events, and sentiments; to identify trends and enable predictions. Finally, to ensure high precision, HQA will process information in its native form for 11 languages, including English.

New catalyst materials are needed to make liquid fuels and hydrogen from biomass more economical and efficient. In this Phase II project a scalable synthesis method will be utilized to prepare 1kg/day batches of high surface area catalysts with proprietary additives to improve low temperature shift activity. During the Phase II research, pH Matter will demonstrate the performance of the novel catalyst compositions under additional customer-specific gas feed environments and demonstrate a method for scaling up the catalyst synthesis process for delivery to BTL system developers and commercial catalyst manufacturers. The end goal is production of catalysts and generation of performance data demonstrating that the catalyst can operate in the full range of contaminants found in biomass sources,reducing the cost and improving the efficiency of fuel production from biomass. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is potentially quite large. The production of energy and liquid fuels from biomass will have a number of beneficial societal impacts. Biomass gasification processes are carbon neutral, since it uses C0 2 that was captured from plants; therefore, biomass gasification will replace energy production from fossil fuels, thus reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Unlike fuel crops, biomass can be garnered from second generation sources like waste products that have no use for human consumption, so the technology does not compete with food sources. Further,using biomass as a source of liquid fuel will reduce the dependence of our nation on foreign sources of energy. The technology developed and refined during the Phase II NSF SBIR program could have application to a wide range of other catalytic reactions as well.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will demonstrate asymmetric supercapacitors that meet or exceed the cost and performance targets set by the United States Advanced Battery Consortium for FreedomCar applications. These devices will be based on low-cost VN and NiOOH with aqueous electrolytes. Currently available commercial products are based on carbon with organic electrolytes and deliver 3-6 Wh/kg with power densities of 700 W/kg at a cost of ~$0.10 per Farad. The cost must be decreased by at least a factor of two for broader market acceptance, and the energy density improved to reduce the supercapacitor size. The proposed SBIR program will lead to next generation supercapacitors with energy densities that approach 15 Wh/kg and costs that are as much as 10 times lower than those for currently available commercial devices. The superior performance and cost are derived from the use of inexpensive, base metal nitrides and oxides tailored to give high specific capacitance, low impedance aqueous electrolytes that enable fast, efficient high power cycling, and an asymmetric design that maximizes the operating potential window. This combination of performance and cost will enable significant expansion in the use of supercapacitors for a number of important applications. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project lies in efficient peak power management of electric loads, such as automotive start/stop systems, acceleration and regenerative braking of hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), and uninterruptible power supplies. Supercapacitors offer a combination of energy and power that complements other electrochemical storage and conversion devices, including batteries and fuel cells. With improvements in energy density and reductions in cost, the markets for supercapacitors are expected to grow rapidly. Transportation and smart grid applications represent large markets with&gt;30% annual growth. The automotive supercapacitor market totaled $55 million in 2009 and could grow to $243 million by 2015, fueled by the demand for HEVs. The smart grid market for supercapacitors is forecasted to reach $2.5 billion in 2015 driven by peak-load management and regenerative braking for light rails.

If the student asks the wrong question, or asks inappropriate questions, then the patient will respond in a way that will prevent a positive doctor-patient relationship from developing. Because it combines video clips and artificial intelligence and is web-based, we anticipate that this training platform will teach a medical school student (and other health professionals) how to really pay attention to their patients, and that it will do so more effectively than other training products already on the market. In Phase II, we will complete the platform build, incorporate additional artificial intelligence and speech recognition capabilities, create versions of the platform that will work on smart phones and tablets, and develop a set of six patient scenarios. This work will result in a platform that closely approximates a natural conversational experience. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be to achieve a significant advancement over currently available computer-based training and other instructional tools. Medical schools are experiencing a transition from passive to active methods of teaching, as professors and students both have the desire to replace passive learning methods of PowerPoint slides, lectures, and instructional videos with more interactive methods of learning. The active experience provided by the AI Patient platform will help students learn to be more effective listeners and better health practitioners, which will result in better patient outcomes.

Typically, portable sensors cannot provide good sensitivity and accuracy. Sensors which do provide adequate sensitivity and accuracy are bulky, power hungry, high maintenance, and require a controlled operational environment. This is especially true for existing CO2 13/12C isotope ratio sensors, which require hundreds of watts of power. Portable 13/12C sensors are critical to enable new applications including remote sensor network CO2 sequestration monitoring, environmental carbon cycle measurements, and medical breath analysis. Novel technology using quantum cascade lasers and the latest compact optical cells can provide a compact, power efficient, sensitive, and accurate sensor platform for gas sensing. The research objectives for this project aim to break the tradeoff between power consumption, sensitivity, complexity, and size. This project targets the development of a robust, field-deployable, outdoor sensor, and verifies its performance against existing methods of measuring CO2 isotope ratio. The realization of the final product will deliver a portable 13/12C isotope ratio laser spectrometer that operates in harsh environments using less than 15 Watts of power. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project deals with enhancing environmental monitoring by: 1) Enabling more precise measurements of carbon sources and sinks to improve climate science; 2) Providing a map of real-time carbon emission which is useful for research, policy, and education; 3) Providing real-time, long-term remote carbon measurements for carbon trading markets; 4) Enabling extremely sensitive leak detection of CO2 in carbon capture and sequestration applications without the significant cost of mobile laboratory infrastructure. A more powerful set of gas sensors such as the ones developed through this project will dramatically lower the great expense currently required to precisely monitor greenhouse gases and air pollution, a critical global concern. Data generated by such carbon isotope ratio sensors will answer many critical questions related to the human impact of burning fossil fuels on the environment. These types of sensors will also simultaneously impact industrial and medical fields, providing new solutions for industrial process control and safety, and portable real-time medical breath analyzers.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop and commercialize a new family of polymers (aromatic thermosetting copolyesters, or ATSP) for application to tribological surfaces for compressors used in air conditioning and refrigeration. Surface treatments/coatings are key to improving wear performance and durability in a wide range of applications. The main advantages of polymeric-based coatings are their relatively low cost and simple substrate surface conditioning. ATSP can be processed into highly effective wear-resistant coatings by blending with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and other additives. Key features of the new material are: (1) thermal stability at temperatures required to process with PTFE (350-450 deg. C); (2) excellent tribological properties, with several samples of selected compositions evidencing &quot;zero&quot; wear and low friction coefficient values that remained stable during testing - both important attributes for a long-term wear coating. Additional advantages are the ability to undergo interchain transesterification reactions, permitting reincorporation of wear debris into the coating, and good adhesion to metals such as stainless steel and cast iron. Technical objectives in the Phase II include tailoring the polymer backbone to improve powder/coating properties, optimizing thermal spray parameters for this industrially relevant process, and performing both in-house and customer-based evaluations. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the potential to realize a new materials family which will permit lower cost and more versatile wear coatings for industry. There is strong customer demand for innovations that significantly improve the performance of the tribopair in compressors for refrigeration and air conditioning. Recent investigation for this specific market segment has shown that the ATSP system exhibits the crucial features of merit: low friction coefficient and an order of magnitude reduction in wear rate compared to state-of-the-art polymeric coatings. With the current societal focus on energy efficiency, more attention is being given to the fact that proper coatings and surface treatments are key to increasing efficiency for a wide range of mechanical surfaces (bearings, seals, turbines blades, etc.). Thus, there are opportunities in the much broader market, with the potential for major societal impact, since engines, pumps, and compressors are common equipment that represent a significant share of U.S. energy demand. ATSP has also shown excellent performance in adhesives, rigid foams, matrices for composites, and dielectrics for microelectronics, all of which suggest additional potential markets.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project examines high throughput methods to quantify intacellular microRNA (miRNA) concentrations in cells that have shown to be associated with normal physiological processes, as well as diseases, including cancer. Currently there are no rapid, quantitative methods available to measure miRNA expression in living cells or tumor tissue. All current in vitro approaches require extensive preparation involving extraction, reverse transcription of miRNA into cDNA and amplification. These methods are not only time consuming, but require that the low abundance miRNA be several fold greater than background to give a meaningful result. To meet the demand for a diagnostic/prognostic tool, development of a biomolecular detection device is proposed based on a single electron transistor to bind and measure the concentration of miRNAs. This will provide a researcher or clinician an accurate profile to make proper clinical assessments. Bringing this device to market will provide scientists with direct information on intracellular miRNA levels, enhancing predictions of miRNAs that are essential for tumor maintenance or metastasis, and creating new diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities. The broader impact of this project will be to enhance current diagnostic and prognostic tools for early detection of disease. Today, early cancer detection and treatment offers the best outcome for patients. This has driven the search for effective diagnostics. The identification of a universal tumor specific epitope or marker has remained elusive. While many types of serological and serum markers have included enzymes, proteins, hormones, mucin, and blood group substances, at this time there are no effective diagnostic tests for cancer that are highly specific, sensitive, economical and rapid. This deficiency means that many cases of malignancy go undetected long past the time of effective treatment. The goal of this research is to bring a device to market for the research market and a device that can examine miRNA profiles from patient samples immediately in a hospital or clinical setting. The current size of the in vitro diagnostic market was over $40 billion in 2008. Unique diagnostic kits developed from this technology will likely fulfill an unmet market opportunity with the potential to exceed $100 million in the first 3 - 5 years.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project aims to quickly enable the large-scale manufacturing of organic and flexible electronic devices by leveraging the existing infrastructure used in the display industry. Currently, proven manufacturing techniques do not exist that can make flexible electronics at scale, and all proposed methods would require the abandonment of billions of dollars of equipment and decades of manufacturing expertise based around photolithography. This proposal aims to solve this problem, using photoresist technology that is designed to work with a wide range of materials including organic electronics. Previous research has established the feasibility of these resists, but there is still much work needed to apply the technology to more complex and integrated systems, especially when working with flexible substrates. The Phase I project has revealed the areas of improvement needed to reach mass production and high yields for demanding display applications. This project will address these issues and will create a high-performance process capable of making flexible eReaders with high yield. Researchers will work with industrial and academic partners to gain a better understanding of all of the issues required to be overcome as the process is scaled up to a real application. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be very large for the display industry, which seeks to manufacture innovative flexible eReader displays for the large worldwide education market. The broader commercial potential lies in the sales of high-margin and high-volume chemicals to an industry that will quickly ramp production. The photoresist market for liquid crystal displays (LCDs) is currently $1.2 billion, and it is anticipated that the proposed technology will dominate the organic electronic resist market, which is anticipated to reach similar values. The societal benefits will be seen when the eReaders are brought to classrooms around the world. Their low weight, low power consumption, and physical robustness will allow these displays to fully replace heavy and expensive textbooks, changing the lives of millions of children domestically, and in developing countries such as China and Russia.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop a novel soft magnetic material and fabrication process for magnetic circuits of electric machines, such as winding cores of electric motors. The technology utilizes a unique single-step near net-shape fabrication process based on metal spray deposition to produce an isotropic metal microstructure characterized by small domains with high permeability, high saturation and low coercivity with a controlled formation of insulation boundaries that limit electric conductivity between neighboring domains. The resulting material provides an excellent three-dimensional magnetic path while minimizing energy losses associated with eddy currents. It can replace anisotropic laminated winding cores, which currently constrain the design of conventional electric motors to geometries with two-dimensional magnetic paths. As a further objective of the project, a new hybrid-field motor topology, with three-dimensional magnetic paths enabled by the proposed material and fabrication process, is being developed. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to enable production of electric motors with improved performance and efficiency while reducing cost and material scrap associated with manufacturing of motor winding cores. Electric motors are used extensively in a growing number of applications, including robotics, semiconductor and LED process equipment, industrial automation, electric vehicles, heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems, appliances, power tools, medical devices, and military and space exploration applications. These markets drive an increasing demand for electric motors with improved performance, higher efficiency, and lower cost. Considering the extensive use of electric motors globally, the disruptive change resulting from the proposed hybrid-field motor technology with spray-formed winding cores is expected to provide significant commercial, societal and environmental benefits, including improved manufacturing efficiency, waste reduction, and energy conservation.",

The MIRU-D prototype EDU design is flexible and scalable.  ATA sees potential for reducing the size of the MIRU-D mechanism to make it viable for smaller airborne platforms such as UAVs, helicopters, and tactical fighter aircraft.  ATA currently produces a smaller angular rate sensor (ARS-15) that could be incorporated in the current design for significant cost savings, lower SWaP, with just a slight degradation in performance.  ATA is also developing a new state-of-the-art angular rate sensor (ARS-16) that has performance better than the current ARS-14 with a size similar to the ARS-15.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Select Engineering Services (SES) has developed a composite Instrument Landing System (ILS) tower that improves sustainability (by eliminating costly maintenance) and increases airfield safety through a frangible design. Current ILS towers are made from steel components and require costly Mobile Depot Maintenance (MDM) to mitigate corrosion. The development of frangible structures has primarily focused on qualifying the frangibility of the structure itself, without regard to accompanying accessories and attachments that are also part of the system. The focus of this Phase II effort will be to design, develop, qualify and build electrical cables, a ladder system, and a lightning protection system that does not impact the frangible properties of the tower. SES&quot;s approach will be to develop and qualify the necessary accessories and components in order to conduct Formal Qualification Testing (FQT) on a full-scale tower with integrated accessories (e.g. cabling, lighting protection). SES will produce and deliver working prototypes of a pull-apart frangible power cable, pull-apart lightning protection down conductor, and an extendable ladder climbing solution ready for installation at any given site. This technology will provide a complete frangible ILS Tower solution that increases safety while decreasing maintenance costs.    BENEFIT:  Development of frangible cables, ladders and lightning protection systems (associated with airfield support structures) will increase airfield safety during airfield operations.  In the event of an impact from a wayward aircraft, the frangible towers will give way and allow the safe operation of the aircraft. SES will develop several different products (frangible cables, ladders and lightning protection system) during this SBIR project, all of which will be specifically designed for use on frangible composite ILS Towers. The developed accessories and ladder system could potentially be applied to other frangible items such as approach lights, TACAN towers, street lighting poles, etc.",

In Phase II, POC plans to optimize the system design, improve and extend the underlying technologies to improve nonverbal communication in a virtual world, improve immersive experience, and provide support for patient-physical therapist interaction. We will build and demonstrate the EIViS prototype that is ready for commercial deployment. In addition, the efficacy of the EIViS system will be validated in human tests with the assistance of consultants. POC will develop a practical plan for deploying the EIViS technology as well as two commercially ready pilot applications. The EIViS system will be integrated in the AVESS system where it will be used to support physical and psychological rehabilitation for military amputees.",

Altusys will lead a multidisciplinary team of software engineers, user researchers, experts in economic analysis, modeling, and development, and experts in human data collection in dynamic areas to develop a tool that facilitates informed engagement within local environments in conflict areas, enabling the collection of high quality local information, the extraction of valuable insights, and enhanced decision-making in counter-terrorism and counter-insurgency situations. These techniques provide methods and tools for turning routine local observations and interactions into insights and action, even in areas where information is not readily accessible. The proposed methodology developed in Phase 1 lays the foundation for research and development of technology methods, standards, and tools to support seamless implementation of the methodology by junior infantry.

This effort leverages RAS Multi-Technique SEI Test-bed (FPGAs, and C/C++ code) to demonstrate multiple simultaneous algorithms provide increased identification performance and high confidence accurate reports. The effort builds on existing RAS multi-technique algorithms for emitters employing solid state, phased array, and advanced modulations. Techniques include intra-pulse features on instantaneous frequency, phase and intentional modulations, and multiple pulse temporal and spectral features. Hardware and software approaches are assessed and three or more algorithms in a well defined, open computational architecture were selected for PHASE II COTS NDI hardware implementation and demonstration with a 1 GHz IF. Interface control software allowing intuitive operation of the system and automatic techniques will minimize operator interaction and provide high confidence emitter reports.

This will enable a flexible and powerful missile plume simulator that can be used in airborne laser systems for targeting and seeker tests. Quantum cascade lasers are ideal for simulating light sources in the mid- and long-wave infrared, because their high spectral energy density is equivalent to that of a very bright blackbody source. When the QC material is electrically pumped, energy is directly converted into infrared light with an electro-optical conversion efficiency in the spectral range of interest of about 5-10%, which is orders of magnitude higher than the efficiency of a thermal source, whose emission is spread over a very broad spectral range and not directional. This high brightness sources can be very versatile and can be designed to target specific emission characteristics according to the application requirements. The QC laser based approach to simulating a black body can be achieved using current technology. The approach is versatile and scalable. Our proposal will deliver a QCL based prototype version of a blackbody element for simulation tests at different blackbody temperatures.",

To address the need for newly formed teams to rapidly become cognitively ready and effective, the Aptima team proposes to develop the Assessment and Development Strategies FOr Rapid team Cognitive Effectiveness (ADS FORCE) system. In Phase I, Aptima laid the theoretical foundation for the development of ADS FORCE which will help teams enhance their levels of cognitive readiness at various points in development. During Phase II, Aptima will use that theoretical foundation to fully develop the system which contains two different training stages. Stage 1 uses a virtual environment where teams can train prior to pre-deployment training (extending a teams training cycle). Automated measurement results and team development strategies are delivered to the leader. Stage 2 occurs in a face-to-face environment, where the leader has more control over the assessment and training functions.

At hypersonic velocities, the flow may ionize and form a plasma sheath around the vehicle, ablating heat shield material can be entrained in the flow, and non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) effects can become important. All these effects can change the vehicle electro-optic (EO) and radar cross section signatures, interfering with tracking, targeting, and aim-point selection. Spectral Sciences, Inc. (SSI) proposes to develop innovative chemistry and radiation software modules to upgrade existing MDA engineering and next generation hypersonic wake/reentry flowfield signature tools.

The proposed approach is based on several innovations including: a novel way to include critical NLTE chemistry and radiation physics with accuracy and computational efficiency, the ability to generate chemical rates and spectroscopic data for neutrals and ions for various relevant materials, and a modular design that can be readily integrated to upgrade existing and next generation MDA signature tools.",

Troubleshooting methods and repair actions will be a hybrid causal-based and knowledge-based system that is populated and trained using existing historical maintenance data from the WR-ALC LEAN Depot Maintenance System (LDMS). The prioritization will be based on fault analysis of recorded maintenance and repair actions to effect a reduction in mean-time-to-repair (MTTR) rates and an increase in mean-time-between-maintenance events (MTBME), with emphasis on (1) using analog-degradation analysis of digital data as a leading contributor to intermittent problems and increase in CND (could not duplicate) repair codes; and (2) identifying&quot;bad actor&quot;chains wherein one component degrades, then causes other components to subsequently fail.  BENEFIT:  There is a large installed base of complex aerospace systems in service requiring rapid repair times as failures occur.   Conventional methods of determining the problem root cause do not take full advantage of relevant historical data to improve the process of repairing the system, especially at the Circuit Card Assembly (CCA) level .   The anticipated benefits of an Expert Troubleshooting System (ETSS) using an Analog-Degradation Detection and Analysis (ADDA) tester are the following:  1. Mean-time-to- repair (MTTR) rate is reduced.  2. Mean-time-between-maintenance events (MTBME) is increased.  3. Reliability is increased because a&quot;bad actor chain&quot;(when a single failure  cascades to cause subsequent downstream components to be stressed and fail) is repaired in a single maintenance event.  4. Could not duplicate (CND) repair codes are reduced because ETSS and ADDA provide a method of detecting analog degradation of digital data, and such degradation causes both intermittent and solid failures in the field.  Commercial applications include the Depot-Level repair of electronic systems such as office automation equipment, automated teller machines, automotive electronic modules, and industrial machine tools having electronic controls.",

Aircraft, Landing Gear, Engine and Propeller components are typically made of High Strength Steel (HSS), Low Strength Steel (LSS), Inconel 718, Titanium, Aluminum and other alloys, and are very sensitive to processing techniques.  Currently, surface finishes such as chrome plating and Thermal Sprayed Coatings (such as HVOF WC-Co or WC-Co-Cr) coatings are stripped using wet chemical baths (or mechanical means) at overhaul.  However, both processes require different chemical solutions or mechanical processes that can be harmful to the substrates during processing.    This proposal will discuss the research and development, future qualification requirements, and related concerns that will utilize an environmentally and process friendly, pulse water strip system to remove both platings and thermal sprayed coatings (and other organic and inorganic coatings) applications on aircraft, landing gear, engine and propeller components.  BENEFIT:  The research discovered from removing chrome plating and thermal sprayed coatings on Aircraft, Landing Gear, Engine and Propeller components will benefit the military and commercial world usage of HSS materials, such as 300M (280-300 KSI), LSS materials, such as 4340 (180-200 KSI), Inconel 718, titanium and other alloys.

The system will make use of multiple color-coded FBG sensors can be cascaded in a single fiber to form a natural&quot;self-contained&quot;sensor network, providing synchronized and correlated sensing. The sensors will make precise measurements of sequence of impact and timing of penetration, while smart algorithms make correction and determining given penetration depths for varying structure densities according to real-time data.  This system developed in Phase II will be validated during live-fire tests on 10&quot;x10&quot;x6&quot;concrete targets with 0.3 scale BLU-109 penetrators.  The proposed system will provide significant cost-savings over current techniques, while improving measurement accuracy.",

In this effort we will advance the foundations of data representation and fusion at various levels of abstraction. We target the problem of complex event recognition in network information environment, where lack of effective visual processing tools and incomplete domain knowledge frequently cause uncertainty in the datasets and consequently, in the visual primitives extracted from it. We employ Markov Logic Network (MLN) to address the task of reasoning under uncertainty. In Phase I, we demonstrated use of MLN as a domain knowledge representation language that can be used for inferring complex events in real world.  In Phase II, our emphasis will be on developing algorithms to fuse data from multiple sources, perform reasoning in the presence of incomplete data, and transfer learning for domain adaptation. At the visual processing level, transfer learning will enable zero-shot recognition of unknown classes. At the decision level, transfer learning is applied to MLN to automatically infer rules for related but unseen domains. Technical claims made during the study will be justified using rigorous testing and comparison with other state-of-the-art methods on publically available datasets.",

In particular, this project pursues high-risk, high-payoff forward-looking concepts on future airborne networking by postulating a network comprised of thousands of long persistence heterogeneous platforms that provide end to end connectivity via a series of short, low power hops. The proposed architecture consists of three key technologies: Hybrid MAC (HyMAC), Multi-Channel Radio and Topology Control (MCR-TC), and Digital Hormone Model (DHM) augmented with Criticality-Sensitive Control (CSC). The resulting system architecture will support heterogeneous capabilities of the airborne nodes. HyMAC will enable seamless and efficient channel bandwidth allocation even when the airborne infrastructure consists of a mix of omni-directional and directional antenna airborne nodes. MRC-TC and DHM/CSC will offer extremely efficient, autonomous mechanism to cluster/decluster nearby airborne assets as well as allocating communication resources based on dynamic traffic demands, mission objectives, and system constraints if any.

Surface CW contamination presents a serious threat both to the civilian and military sectors and an adequate defense against these weapons will require rapid detection and identification of both known and unknown agents.  Recent measurements in the scientific literature suggest that passive long wave infrared sensors are capable of detecting liquids on the ground by utilizing cold sky reflectance. The physics of passive detection of liquids on surfaces is not well understood. However, the cold-sky refection drives the physics of passive detection of liquids on surfaces. A better understanding of the physics of cold-sky reflectance is needed to understand and exploit this phenomenon.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Aircraft structure, engine, propeller and landing gear systems utilize high and low strength steel, cad-plated threaded components and fasteners throughout its structure.  Threaded components and fasteners manufactured from these alloys require sacrificial protective coatings due to the corrosive environment.  Cadmium has traditionally been the preferred coating for such threaded components and fasteners due to its many desirable functional qualities.  In addition to corrosion protection, cadmium also provides excellent lubricity characteristics; however, cadmium is a toxic metal and known carcinogen that poses environmental and occupational safety and health risks throughout the life cycle of the plated parts.  ES3 successfully completed the Phase I effort meeting its primary goal of demonstrating that IZ-C17+ with trivalent conversion coating IZ-264 performs as well as Low Hydrogen Embrittlement (LHE) Cad plate on threads for upfront screening tests.  Phase II testing validates the Zn-Ni IZ-C17+ with IZ-264 post treatment process in comparison to LHE cad utilizing industry accepted requirements for threaded fasteners / components for process installation, corrosion, thickness, fatigue, adhesion, hydrogen embrittlement and resistance to paint strippers and fluids  The Phase II.5 transition plan will focus on implementing a full scale alkaline Zn-Ni (IZ-C17+) process barrel and rack plating line for usage at WR-ALC, conducting field evaluations and updating the technical data to authorize the use of alkaline Zn-Ni on LSS and HSS threaded fasteners and components for aircraft structural, propeller, and landing gear components..    BENEFIT:  Research conducted to evaluate the alkaline zinc-nickel as a cadmium alternate focuses on military applications at USAF&quot;s aircraft component and propeller maintenance repair facility at Robins AFB, Georgia; however, benefits will be similar for all commercial &amp; military aircraft, engine and landing gear usages where cadmium electroplating is applied.  The following list benefits ES3 expects from the alkaline zinc-nickel process for electroplating of threaded fasteners and components based on both industry and in-house research:   Drop in replacement for all cad plated, threaded components and fasteners on low and high strength steel components.   Eliminate health exposure concerns of cad plating (including brush cad) and meet OSHA emission regulations.   Replace all IVD aluminum process, gaining the following benefits:  o Ability to plate Internal Diameters (ID)  o Lower processing costs  o Unlimited process size constraints (tank size is only limiting factor).  IVD chambers are size limited.   o Eliminate Hydrogen Re-Embrittlement risks after exposure to aqueous cleaners.  o Increased lubricity factors over IVD.

        "abstract": "Understanding the installed performance of antennas and optimizing their placement on platforms is critical to achieving the expected operational performance of the RF systems they support. Installing antennas on aircraft degrades their performance relative to freestanding conditions in terms of field-of-view, raised sidelobes, introduction of multipath delayed signals, radome-induced beam shifting, and changed&quot;loading conditions&quot;caused by the platform. Also, the cositing of many antennas on a single platform creates high probability of intra-system EMI and the subsequent need to maintain EMC among the simultaneously operating RF equipment. Measurements to support and verify antenna integration engineering decisions always carry the benefit of providing trusted results since real systems are being tested on a real aircraft. However, measurement alone is far from sufficient because of its important limitations, chief among which is its very high cost. The proposed effort will continue the development of Savant-Hybrid and WIPL-D PDM, culminating in a pair of upgraded tools with significantly enhanced accuracy, application scope, and speed.

No methods currently exist for treating burns that concurrently reduce pain upon treatment, are intimately conformal to regular and irregular (face, fingers) wound surfaces, provide a cell substrate for wound closure and healing, and do not require dressing removal, such as with the proposed spray-on polymer coating. This investigation will involve cytocompatibility and wound healing studies of these novel polymers, in conjunction with a determination of the polymers? physical and mechanical properties needed for spray-on characteristics. The success of this investigation will demonstrate that a sophisticated, yet inexpensive, easily applied, conformal polymer coating can be used for burn treatment with reduction of scarring. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project pertains to the commercialization of a novel spray-on transparent polymer coating, delivered from a non-stinging, volatile hydrophobic solvent, to treat first and second degree burn injuries, with reduction of scar formation. Burn injuries constitute one of the most expensive aspects of health care. There are more than 40 million scar patients worldwide per year, at a treatment cost of $12 billion. Currently, no commercial burn care product or methodology provides for improved burn healing with reduced pain and reduced scar formation utilizing a patient and caregiver-friendly technique such as given by this investigation. Despite substantial research in tissue engineering for the preparation of scaffolds for topical wound care, the few commercialized products are costly in preparation, storage and use, and are subject to degradation and loss of activity. With the success of this project, a new technology will be developed that significantly improves burn treatment, is based upon readily synthesized, stable polymers in a commercially-available solvent, that provides a transparent, water-insoluble, oxygen- and water-vapor permeable coating suitable for use over large area burn wounds without forming a patch-work design, and which self-removes as the wound heals.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop novel type of porous carbon materials with aligned pores for applications in electrical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs). These devices are serving multiple applications, such as smart electrical grids, hybrid-electric vehicles, energy-efficient industrial equipment and personal electronics. Conventional EDLCs store energy by adsorbing organic electrolyte ions on the internal surface of activated carbon electrodes under the application of electrical potential. They commonly take 10 to 100 seconds to charge or discharge. This charge rate is limited by the diffusion of ions inside the tortuous pores of activated carbons. The growing numbers of pulse-power applications, however, often need current boosts for only 1-10 seconds. These applications, therefore, will utilize a fraction of the energy storage capability of conventional EDLCs, which greatly increases the total weight and cost of the energy storage system, slowing down technology adoption. Herein, we propose an innovative low-cost material synthesis route for the formation of porous carbons with finely controlled microstructure, tunable pore size, high surface area, and, most importantly, aligned micropores for rapid ion transport and high power density. These materials offer a combination of fast charging rate and high specific capacitance. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the contribution to dramatic improvements in EDLC technology and reduction of its cost. EDLCs, unlike secondary batteries, exhibit much higher specific power and demonstrate outstanding cycle life and greatly improved safety. The use of EDLCs in transportation and industrial equipment could lead to a major reduction in energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Their application in electrical grids will make multiple renewable energy technologies, such as wind and solar, more economical. The rate of adoption of this important technology could be significantly enhanced if EDLCs could be produced at a lower cost or if they offered further improved performance. These device characteristics are linked to the cost and properties of activated carbon electrodes. Unfortunately, nearly all EDLC manufacturers rely on the existing manufacturers of activated carbon. The expected improvements in material properties from this Phase II project are expected to have a major impact on the EDLC market size and the EDLC technology adoption.",

The successful Phase 1 proposal identified this marine XI as capable of performing Simultaneous Isomerization and Fermentation (SIF) of xylose to ethanol. High efficiency conversion of xylose to ethanol can improve overall process yield by 20-40%. The Phase II project will optimize the production of the enzyme in native and high-productivity heterologous hosts leading to a low cost source of the new enzyme. The optimized enzyme will be further characterized and then produced in a 200 liter bioreactor to demonstrate scalability leading to commercialization. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to enable the cost-effective commercial production of cellulosic ethanol. Ethanol from local cellulosic biomass is a sustainable transportation fuel that reduces greenhouse gas emissions by an average of 87% according to the Argonne National Lab?s GREET model. The toxicity of tailpipe emissions are also reduced relative to petroleum-based fuels. As a domestic source of fuel, cellulosic ethanol adds to U.S. energy security and strengthens our economy. By creating jobs and recycling dollars into the U.S. economy, cellulosic ethanol improves the trade deficit and lessens the dependence on foreign petroleum. By developing a low-cost enzyme that is added directly to the fermentation, difficulties with genetically modified fermentation organisms are avoided. This not only simplifies the ethanol production process, but also reduces the GMO content of co-products that may enter the food chain.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to develop a platform for the production of spider silk fibroins in plant trichomes. Synthetic spider silk has great potential as an environmentally-friendly biomaterial because it is very flexible yet has a tensile strength greater than steel. A great need exists for a scalable strategy for spider silk fibroin production in a renewable heterologous system that will allow efficient harvest and recovery. The platform is a natural mechanism for protein production and purification in the plant Nicotiana tabacum. The technological innovation is the targeted expression of spider silk fibroins within the gland cells of leaf surface structures called glandular secreting trichomes. The research objectives will be to optimize the production of spider silk fibroins and generate fibers from harvested proteins. The goal is to drive the expression of different spider silk fibroins in trichomes using patented promoters, and refine methods of fibroin recovery, so that fibers with differing physical properties can be generated and tested. This work will demonstrate further that spider silk fibroins can be produced by plant trichomes in a cost-effective manner, and will allow the large-scale, photosynthetic production of next-generation biomaterials. What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity? The broader impact/commercial potential of this project, if successful, will be to demonstrate that a variety of synthetic spider silk fibroins can be produced in a plant-based system, and to better understanding the biosynthetic hardware of the specialized plant structures called glandular secreting trichomes. This work will allow the development of novel ways of achieving industrial biomaterial production without the use of toxic chemicals, and will thus have great societal impact by decreasing the necessity of utilizing large amounts of hazardous compounds in industrial processes. The commercial impact of this project will implement a platform for the photosynthetic production of environmentally-friendly biomaterials.",

The mobile payment system takes advantage of the speed of contemporary mobile devices to enable secure web-based transactions. This payment system revolutionizes payment by bypassing existing legacy credit and debit card infrastructure. New security algorithms and models will be developed to enable the secure transfer of banking information. The proposed payment system empowers consumers to control privacy, security, and localization settings in their mobile payment apps. The local advertising network changes the value proposition for both merchants and consumers with respect to ads and coupons, creating an environment in which merchants ?push? ads to ?pulling? customers. The local advertisement network will fundamentally alter the way users think about localization, privacy, and data anonymity. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes the creation of a payment system that revolutionizes commerce. The system will dramatically reduce or eliminate payment interchange fees for merchants, will move consumers much closer to the concept of a fully digital wallet, and will create a new level of engagement between merchants and consumers that is mutually beneficial. Small, independent merchants will immediately realize many of the benefits of the payment network. These merchants typically pay between $15,000 and $200,000 annually in credit and debit card interchange fees. The proposed payment system will reduce or eliminate these fees enabling business expansion and job creation. The payment system effectively creates local commerce zones where ?buying local? is implicitly strongly encouraged through in-network, in-app local advertising, coupons, and loyalty programs. The payment system includes seamless peer-to-peer digital funds transfers. The ultimate goal is a payment system to make all commerce - all transfers of funds - frictionless, fast, simple, and easy. The mobile commerce market is expected to grow from over $200B this year to over $600B by 2015. The technology developed herein will be a vital driver of that growth.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop a new sumatriptan delivery method for effective migraine therapy that offers both rapid and sustained relief from pain. Triptans are the mainstay of treatment for acute migraine. Migraines are typically treated using tablets or nasal sprays that provide a slow drug release or via injection that provides the fastest drug release. However, the administration via injection is not accessible to patients at the moment of need. The proposed patent-protected drug delivery patch will target over nine million chronic migraine patients who are dissatisfied with currently available pain relief treatment options. The technology is based on the use of dissolvable microneedles that do not cause pain because of their small size. The method will provide a non-invasive, rapid release of migraine medication (e.g. sumatriptan) with minimal inconvenience to patients. It also incorporates a sustained mechanism of drug delivery. The Phase II project objectives are to further optimize the formulations for fabrication of the dissolvable microneedles, scale-up the manufacturing and validate the patch application in animal tests. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is as follows: The proposed dissolvable microneedle technology for painless drug delivery through the skin is generic and its use is envisioned for a wide variety of drugs. The microneedle technology will enable new ways for novel drug delivery for both small and large drug molecules through the skin. The total potential market size for this platform technology may include protein drugs ($27 billion, expanding rapidly due to advances in biotechnology and DNA recombinant technology), vaccine ($7 billion), and cosmetics ($8 billion). The delivery of migraine medication that is being developed under this project has a $5.0 billion market worldwide because there is an immediate customer need for non-invasive, immediate release pain-relief methods. The potential impact of the proposed technology is very broad, bringing migraine pain relief to about 10% of the adult population worldwide that suffer from moderate to severe chronic migraine pain.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project proposes to develop innovative technical solutions and products that reduce coal mine gas explosion. Methane explosion is the major cause of mining casualty and economic loss. The list of world coal mine explosion is a long and shocking one. Even today, 300 years after human?s initial mining of coal, methane explosion still kills thousands of miners each year worldwide. Developed naturally within coal seams, methane is known for explosion hazard and chemical neutrality, which makes it highly dangerous but difficult to remove. Although modern technologies have been developed to pre-release methane or to dilute it by ventilation, it is practically impossible to eliminate the threat due to frequently occurred gas bursts and accumulation. Due to economic concern, mine owners and managers hesitate to take prompt action in response to each gas alarm. Sometime, their hesitation proved to be deadly. Torrey Hills invented a technology that can effectively capture methane from ambient atmosphere and convert it to safe chemicals, and thus can reduce explosion risk and operation shutdown loss to coal mine owners. The main features of the technology are room-temperature and room-pressure operation, complementary to ventilation, attendance free, and portable. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes not only addition of economic value to coal mine owners and operators, but also contribution to the overall society wealth in a broader sense by reducing life loss and improving environmental protection. The world coal market is estimated to be $400-600 billion per year. According to World Coal Association, the direct economic loss caused by coal methane explosion is over $10 billion worldwide each year. Nevertheless, the broader indirect costs are difficult to measure, including loss of life, hardship on the affected families, disruption to the local business, legal burden on the companies, and associated costs to governments and the society.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will result in a commercially viable network of low cost wireless sensors that predict electric motor failure before failure occurs. American industries and manufacturers rely heavily on electric motors to power their equipment and processes. To minimize motor downtime costs, many use labor intensive preventative maintenance programs, manually inspecting motors on a fixed schedule. These inspections cost an average of $500 per motor per year, with 80% of that cost wasted. This waste can be eliminated through the use of sensors that monitor motor performance in real time, 24x7. Unfortunately, current systems cost thousands of dollars per motor on average. This is too expensive for most 1-150 HP motor applications, which comprise 98% of the motor market. This research will quantify and refine the performance of a low cost network of sensor nodes, and algorithms used by the nodes to predict motor failures, through controlled laboratory testing and field testing. It will also integrate vibration energy harvesting technology into the nodes. The result will be a network of sensor prototypes that are demonstrated to meet key performance and price metrics, and are commercially viable for use with 1-150 HP motors. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is that a prototype low cost sensor system will facilitate predictive maintenance of electric motors in US industrial and manufacturing facilities at a fraction of the cost of the current alternatives. As a result, tens of thousands of facilities around the US will be able to afford the initial investment to implement predictive maintenance on their motor systems, maximize up-time, and minimize motor maintenance costs. This will increase the competitiveness of these US industrial and manufacturing firms and ultimately help create and preserve American jobs. Additionally, the prototype system produced as a result of the research will provide an important proof-of-concept for low-cost, low-power wireless sensor nodes that should help spur future development and investment in this field, which is in turn instrumental for the development of &quot;smart grids&quot;, &quot;smart cities&quot;, and other intelligent infrastructure.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop innovative Osorb bioretention systems for enhanced remediation of stormwater quality. PI, Dr. Hanbae Yang, is using novel engineered glass-metal hybrid materials developed by ABSMaterials, Inc. of Wooster, Ohio to remediate environmental pollutants. Runoff control is an immediate and growing concern in the US. Stormwater often laden with nutrients, hydrocarbons, herbicides, and pharmaceuticals, damaging surface water and carrying persistent chemicals impacting humans and ecosystems. Dr. Yang&#039;s innovations for controlling runoff pollutants using engineered glass (Osorb)-metal composites mixed into bioretention systems have demonstrated effectiveness on atrazine, estradiol, endocrine disruptors, BTEX, and nutrients. The Osorb-metal composites combine two advanced remediation materials: (1) a high-capacity organosilica sorbent, Osorb, and (2) reactive embedded metals. The composite materials absorb pollutants by removing them from the water and degrade the pollutants within the glass. The key technology developments to be achieved in Phase II include (1) formula optimization field testing with clients, (2) formulation performance improvements, and (3) development of commercial and modular bioretention packages. Compared to older bioretention systems, it is expected some of these systems will see orders-of-magnitude improvement in effective stormwater pollutant remediation and set new standards for best management practice. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project conducted by Dr. Yang and ABSMaterials will include: (1) providing an entirely new tool for resolving combined sewer overflow challenges with green infrastructure for dozens of cities, (2) substantial reduction of environmental pollution with lower treatment cost for contaminated stormwater, (3) improvement of aquatic and human health, and (4) facilitation of green stormwater reuse. The EPA and state governments are mandating many stormwater programs control non-point-source/CSO pollution. The tools for runoff treatment are often lacking to meet stricter regulations. Developing economical and effective Osorb-based stormwater solutions will substantially reduce negative effects of runoff pollutants on human and aquatic health. Seattle estimates economic impact of uncontrolled stormwater runoff at $113M and plans to build 12,000 bioretention systems to reduce urban runoff by 16,000,000 gallons annually. Other cities, including Cleveland, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and New York, are developing similar green infrastructure strategies. ABSMaterials is further developing an integrated curriculum for science courses at high schools and colleges and providing internships and training experiences involving advanced materials and water remediation. The company expects to create 6 new full-time positions working directly on the commercial activities during the period of this grant.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will address the efficiency issues with existing solar harvesting technology and the excessive power consumed by the power management circuitry. The proposed technology addresses the solar performance issues by including a low-power Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) algorithm to maximize solar collection efficiency under variable lighting conditions. The patented technology reduces the power consumed in the charging electronics by 60x over existing products. The solar power solutions developed will minimize the charging time while meeting portable form-factor requirements in both indoor and outdoor lighting conditions. The first development phase will define specifications and develop system level implementations for portable charging and standalone off-grid applications. In the second phase, technologies used in the prototype systems will be integrated into a single device to further reduce overall size and system costs. The final product of this Phase II effort will be single-chip integrated power management devices for portable charging applications and standalone autonomous off-grid systems. These devices will deliver class-leading solar conversion efficiency both indoors and outdoors, and have revolutionary power dissipation levels that will enable new applications and markets that were not possible with products on the market today. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to improve the environment, enable new markets, and provide opportunities, jobs, and tax revenue. In the past, solar energy harvesting was not taken seriously due to lack of flexibility and portability. Early solar panels and harvesting electronics were too inefficient and expensive to be useable, and remained a niche product. With advances in harvesting and charging technologies, solar power can be used effectively in many consumer standalone and portable applications. The proliferation of these efficient, cost-effective solar and low-power solutions can reduce a system?s carbon footprint. Utilizing this proposal?s technology and working closely with solar panel manufacturers, solar charging and energy harvesting becomes a viable alternative to replaceable batteries and grid-power. North American consumers use approximately 200,000 tons of cell batteries each year, 95% of which end up as waste. High-efficiency solar rechargeable systems can reduce the amount of toxic battery waste that ends up in neighborhood landfills. In addition to the positive environmental impact, the technology enables new markets and growth in existing markets which allows firms to grow and provide opportunities, jobs and more than an estimated $1.5 million in federal income tax revenue over the next 5 years.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project addresses current limitations in hydrogen compression and enables reduction in hydrogen requirements for several applications through recycling of exhaust hydrogen containing water and other benign impurities. In Phase 1, feasibility of operating a proton exchange membrane (PEM)-based device as a high efficiency electrochemical compressor/purifier was demonstrated at up to 3 A/cm2. In Phase 2, refinement of the microporous plate will be performed for optimal water distribution, which will enable more uniform fluid distribution and high current densities. Poison-tolerant catalysts will also be developed to enable a broader range of applications. The objectives of this phase also include additional test stand modifications to enable a broader range of test conditions, demonstration of gas purity through analysis to determine the separation efficiency, and development of system schematics and product requirements. The anticipated result will be an improved hydrogen recycler which will enable substantial reduction in hydrogen production cost and new market opportunities. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes applications ranging from power plants to heat treating to backup power and fueling. For example, over 16,000 power plants worldwide use hydrogen as a cooling fluid in the turbine windings. Currently, increases in dew point cause significant decreases in cooling efficiency and increase windage losses by several percent, requiring purging of the hydrogen chamber and increased production to backfill. Thus, significant energy waste is generated. Current solutions for hydrogen compression are also noisy, bulky, and inefficient. In applications where hydrogen is being evaluated as an alternative fuel, high pressure storage is needed. Having a mechanical compressor that represents half of the size and material cost of a home fueling or backup power device is not commercially feasible. The device proposed has the opportunity to decrease the energy required to produce pure hydrogen by 75% over generating additional hydrogen from water, and to compress the hydrogen with as little as 200 mV of overpotential even at high current density. Advances in these areas would find immediate commercial interest, and address key strategic areas on the government agenda related to energy savings and green technology.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop an ultra-thin high-R-value robust vacuum insulation panel (VIP). Thermal models indicate that with a half-inch thick VIP, an R-value of 40 can be achieved with an expected cost of ~$3 per square foot. The technology uses tensile structural elements as thermal impedances and is based on a 2011 patent which has been exclusively licensed from the University of Illinois at Chicago. The VIP is expected to be suitable for installation in industrial and residential structures, since it has a stainless steel foil exterior as opposed to current VIP technology, which uses a laminate of polyester and aluminum foil as its vacuum barrier. The aluminum foil creates a thermal short (edge losses) in current VIPs which can greatly reduce their effective R-value. The use of stainless steel has the additional advantage of significantly reducing edge losses as well as increasing puncture resistance. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be a drastic reduction in the energy required to heat and cool buildings, or to refrigerate trucks used to transport perishable goods. In transportation, a refrigerated hi-cube trailer with two inches of polyurethane foam has an R-value of ~10, which can be increased to 50 by incorporating a half-inch-thick VIP. Most refrigerated trailers in the US consume ~1 gallon of diesel fuel each hour to keep their loads cold. Since there are ~330,000 refrigerated trailers operating for ~1,500 hours/year, this translates into a fuel savings of 80%, or nearly 1% of the total diesel fuel consumption in this country each year. Compact and inexpensive thermal insulation can allow better use of space inside new dwellings, and be used to retrofit existing dwellings with more effective insulation. Finally, a 2002 review prepared for the US Department of Housing and Urban Development cited low puncture resistance as a key factor slowing the adoption of vacuum insulation panels in the residential market. The proposed innovation will mitigate this factor and speed adoption in this market.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the problem of everyday noisy environments that limit when and where people can be heard clearly over various communication devices (phones, first-responder radios, voice-over-IP, etc.). Given the inability of single-microphone noise-reduction techniques to handle non-stationary noise (e.g. restaurant noise) the industry&#039;s current solution is the use of dual-microphone techniques. However, dual-microphone techniques cost more, require more hardware, need spatial separation between the noise and speech, and can only process the signal on the transmit side. The proposed technology is a single-microphone software-only solution that effectively handles non-stationary noise coming from any direction and can process the signal on both the transmit and receive sides. The novelty of the approach is its use of speech-specific characteristics and knowledge of human perception to extract speech from the noisy signal. The objective of the proposed research is to improve the current method of detecting voice activity, enabling better speech extraction thereby resulting in enhanced speech quality. The resulting technology will be architecture agnostic, cost effective and have superior performance in everyday situations. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is considerable and compelling. The initial focus will be the mobile phone industry, which is now the single largest user of noise suppression products with a market size that includes nearly all of humanity. The technology will then be optimized to improve the listening experience for hundreds of millions of potential hearing-aid/cochlear implant users worldwide. According to the World Health Organization, there are 278 million people worldwide that have hearing loss. This number is expected to at least double over the next 30 years due to the growth in the number of senior citizens over 65 years of age and the growth in the number of younger people who are needing hearing aids 20 years sooner than their parents due to loud-music listening habits. Additional markets include first-responder radios, voice-over-IP and military/intelligence/homeland-security.

Sophisticated scaffolding guides learners and helps them achieve full potential by encouraging exploration yet minimizing frustration without giving the answer away.

The broader impact/commercial potential of this project addresses a need to ignite interest in STEM study and careers at a critical time in students&#039; education. There is a current lack of research-based, efficacy proven innovative digital STEM teaching materials. Research shows that middle school is a pivotal time for encouraging students to pursue math and science related fields. If interest and engagement in science are not maintained through middle and high school, successful pursuit of STEM fields drops significantly. Math and science assessment test results show that U.S. students consistently perform lower than international counterparts. In addition, women are significantly underrepresented in STEM careers, filling only 24% of STEM jobs while they hold 48% of all jobs in the U.S. Educational games provide a goal-driven, social framework for thinking about relevant topics and practicing skills. Through play and experimentation, games can provoke curiosity, enthusiasm and creativity about content. While games&#039; merits for increasing engagement are clear, their role in improving educational content is even more important. As a scalable solution to a persistent problem, Martha Madison&#039;s Marvelous Machines has the potential to significantly impact U.S. learning and achievement in science.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase II project will further develop the next-generation DNA test kits for forensic DNA testing. DNA profiling has developed significantly over the past 20 years and is routinely used to solve crime. Despite improvements in DNA testing technologies and equipment, a significant number of investigative biological samples do not yield informative results, due to excessive degradation of DNA. A significant number of crime scene and mass disaster samples are still unable to produce useful profiles due to current technology limitations. This research project utilizes a proprietary primer design approach in to analyze a significant number of degraded DNA samples. This project will also contribute to a basic understanding of human populations and their ancestral origins. The broader impact/commercial potential of this proposed project, if successful, will allow society to obtain answers to identification questions that could not previously be obtained, due to the limitations of current technology. Some of the benefits that can be expected from the development of this technology include: Solving more crimes using next generation DNA tests, including cases that were previously not testable, due to excessively degraded samples; assisting in the resolution of missing persons cases; provide closure to families of mass disaster victims such as the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Hurricane Katrina as well as identifying human remains of soldiers who lost their lives on foreign soil; provide ancestral origin information for individuals seeking information regarding their genealogy; provide a powerful intelligence tool that can be used for national security, military and in-combat efforts; and provide data for the educational and research studies of human anthropology. Overall, the resulting commercial impact of this transformational technology and the positive contribution it will have to society is immeasurable.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will continue the development of a low-cost real-time bio-electrochemical nitrate sensor for surface water monitoring initially funded as an NSF SBIR Phase I project. In Phase I, Cambrian Innovation demonstrated the feasibility of a bio-electrochemical sensor for measuring the level of nitrate in a water sample. Following the initial proof-of-principle, a microscale sensor prototype was developed and tested. The Phase II project will continue the development of the bio-electrochemical nitrate sensor to reach a detection level of less than 1 mg-N/L with a stable deployment of 6 months. Phase II development will optimize the sensor architecture and operational conditions for improved performance and develop a long-lasting substrate for microbial growth. Phase II will also include the design and construction of prototype electronic components, including the signal processing algorithm for interpreting the signal emitted by the bio-electrochemical cell. Finally, the sensor performance will be validated by extensive laboratory testing under controlled conditions followed by the initiation of field testing. Upon Phase II completion, Cambrian will be prepared for final development and testing of a first-generation nitrate sensor system in a Phase IIB project. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project addresses environmental nitrogen management, one of the most pressing issues facing society in the 21st century. Nitrate contamination of waterways has become a high profile topic due to anoxic dead zones and drops in fish populations. A significant portion of this environmental impact has been attributed to agricultural run-off (USGS, DOI, 2000). The need for regulation, monitoring, enforcement, and remediation of nitrate pollution is limited by a lack of cost-effective technology for continuous monitoring of nitrate in the environment. Simultaneously, an increased thrust in precision agriculture has been fueled not only by environmental concerns but also by the dramatic improvements in crop yield and quality that can be obtained through careful control of nutrient addition. The development of a low-cost real-time nitrate sensor will transform the management of agricultural facilities, resulting in dramatic improvements in fertilizing efficiency and the environmental impact of the food production industry. Cambrian Innovation is developing a bioelectrochemical nitrate sensor to fill this unmet need and establish a new paradigm in environmental sensing.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will realize the full potential of a new quantum cascade laser (QCL) infrared microscope for medical diagnostics. Infrared microscopy can be used for tissue identification without staining, potentially allowing quick, in situ diagnostics for diseases such as cancer. Present infrared microscopes based on Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometers and cooled detectors have a high cost and slow image acquisition speed that limits their usefulness in standard medical clinic settings. New QCL technology makes compact, broadly tunable laser light sources a reality for the mid-infrared region (3 to 12 um) where these microscopes operate. The high power of these lasers also makes it possible to use less sensitive (and lower cost) room temperature focal plane arrays for image acquisition. The Phase I research demonstrated that microscopy and imaging are indeed possible with coherent light sources like QCLs. The performance enhancements available with the rapid tuning and high intensity of QCLs will allow cancer screening via infrared tissue analysis at unprecedented speeds. The intellectual merit in the proposal is to create a useful product based on this new technology that can benefit cancer researchers and medical diagnostics. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is that infrared microscopes with increased capabilities and reduced cost can be developed and made available for medical diagnostics at the clinic level. Recent research demonstrates that infrared microscopy offers the resolution and tissue identification capabilities necessary for it to be used in automated algorithms for cancer screening. In spite of this potential usefulness, infrared microscopy has been confined to select labs. This is in part due to existing FTIR technology that does not allow the reduction in size and cost, nor increase in acquisition speed and resolution, necessary to make infrared microscopy a common analytical technique. The QCL microscope to be built in Phase II will revolutionize infrared microscopy instrumentation. Based on demonstrated performance of components in Phase I, it is estimated that the time to screen a tissue array for signs of cancer will be reduced from six days with a FTIR microscope, to just three minutes with a QCL microscope. This kind of performance is a game-changer for infrared microscopy, and will help drive larger adoption of the technique in clinical settings, and in automated systems that aid in rapid screening for disease.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is aimed at improving the quality of life of dialysis patients through the development if a new disinfection process of the peritoneal dialysis (PD) catheter connection that will reduce infections related to PD. The prevalence of PD among dyaliss patients is increasing and infection rate has become a target for critical improvement. Since PD is a self-administered treatment, patient adherence to the set-up protocol is vital to ensure that sterility is observed. Unfortunately, this is not always the case - infection remains a pressing concern. The objective of this research is to circumvent the need to for complete patient compliance, and introduce a device that will decontaminate the interfaces of PD catheters that are at most risk of contamination. Research objectives focus on enhancing the device design in an effort to achieve a multifold logarithmic bacterial reduction on multiple pathogens, including bacterial and fungal. Other objectives of this project are to optimize product design, from both performance and usability standpoints. When implemented into the clinic, the disinfection device will allow peritoneal dialysis patients to safely receive the full benefit associated with this mode of treatment. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to develop a new standard of care for all catheters suffering from catheter-related infections at ports. The total addressable market for dialysis, central venous, and peripheral venous lines is $13 Billion. Catheter-related infections still presents as a dangerous health hazard for many markets and as of yet, no disinfectant has emerged to successfully address this issue. The &quot;No Pay&quot; rule implemented in recent years prevents hospitals from being reimbursed from infection-related cases with catheters. The disinfection device will enable the decontamination of catheters and the prevention of luminal infections, thereby greatly reducing the risk of secondary infection. For peritoneal dialysis specifically, this technology allows for home dialysis to be a more attractive option compared to hemodialysis by adding safety, reducing patient morbidity and mortality, while permitting more patients to take advantage of the quality of life benefits that peritoneal dialysis provides.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop a vibration-based cleaning system, the AccelaCleanTM, to dislodge and remove contaminants accumulated on ceramic filters. The feasibility of the concept was demonstrated in Phase I, and diesel particulate filters (DPF) are targeted as a promising application. Nearly all new diesel engines are equipped with DPFs to meet stringent emissions limits. The DPF is a porous ceramic honeycomb mounted in the exhaust, and traps up to 99% of soot emissions. Over time, ash builds up, plugging the DPF channels, negatively impacting fuel economy, and limiting the filters life. Efficient removal of the ash is challenging, as it generally packs in plugs toward the end of the channels. Current cleaning systems are ineffective, resulting in added fuel and maintenance costs, and reducing the life of these expensive filters that may cost more than $5,000. This research will investigate the use of controlled vibrations to target and break-up hard-packed ash in the DPF. The Phase II work will build on the efforts of Phase I, specifically focusing on increasing ash removal rates through anharmonic excitation of the filter, and ensuring filter integrity is not compromised by the cleaning method. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will enable improved engine efficiency and extend DPF component life. Over 33% of DPFs can not be cleaned to acceptable levels using currently available technologies, and nearly all cleaning methods leave some amount of residual ash in the DPF. Despite their inefficiencies, commercial ash cleaning systems are expensive. More effective DPF ash cleaning can provide considerable annual fuel and maintenance cost savings to the end-user, and enables more effective emission control system operation. The US and European DPF cleaning service market is large and rapidly growing, due in part to increasingly stringent emissions regulations. FSTs proposed DPF cleaning technology provides a more effective, simpler, and less expensive DPF cleaning solution. It reduces DPF ash-related fuel economy impacts, extends filter cleaning intervals, and improves emission control system durability and performance. This technology is not limited to emission control applications, but a wide range of filtration applications where effective filter cleaning is required.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is about a devastating medical error that affects millions of women, a breast cancer that can be felt by hand but remains unconfirmed and untreated for months or years. Known as missed, palpable breast cancer, the cause is plainly, lack of training and skill. The result is delayed diagnosis for millions of women and disease that is more extensive, painful, and costly. Poorly performed breast exams also result in unnecessarily high rates of false positive findings, which means ?detecting? disease that is not truly present. MammaCare scientists developed and standardized training and certification for nurses and physicians to perform proficient and effective breast exams. This training is taught by expert instructors who teach practitioners how to reliably detect small, suspicious breast tumors, about the size of a pea. However, this training is costly and time consuming. It cannot reach the thousands of nursing and medical students and practitioners who perform these exams. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to reduce the toll of breast cancer by giving all nurses who examine women the skill to detect the smallest, earliest signs of the disease. To do this we created a new skill-based teaching technology using high-fidelity breast models, computers and the Internet to provide practitioners with essential breast exam skills. The training is self-administered, inexpensive, and effective. Our colleagues at the Mayo Clinic found that nursing students and nurses were much more accurate in detecting breast tumors after the training than they were before receiving it. The potential benefits of this technology for millions of women are reduced medical errors, improved breast cancer screening accuracy, and a better chance for disease-free survival.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the challenge of coupling direct drive servo actuators to industrial robotic plants with uncertainties. Enhanced productivity sought in many applications requires higher cycle rates placing great demands on machine kinematics, actuators and control systems. Further increase in operating speed must resolve dynamic challenges intrinsic in directly coupling servo actuators and robot linkages. When compared with existing electromechanical servo actuators - which route power through complex mechanical transmissions - direct-drive actuation of robot linkages enables simple mechanics and rapid motion, but does not provide dynamic isolation between the actuator and robotic plant. Consequently, direct-drive servo actuators are sensitive to variations in plant parameters, unknown disturbances, and un-modeled dynamics. This project will investigate and develop a prototype of an innovative, direct-drive pneumatic robot actuator that employs an advanced control strategy to rapidly accommodate dynamic system variations. Effectiveness of a new control strategy that relies on limited specific knowledge of the plant to optimize robustness to bounded uncertainties will be researched and developed. Success of this project will provide for significant advances in speed, load capacity, and affordability in contemporary industrial robotic systems. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project involves engineering research conducted to enhance understanding of the dynamic interaction between direct-drive servo actuators and robotic mechanisms, and further to enhance the effectiveness and understanding of a control strategy which provides for an advantageous coupling between them, heretofore not practically feasible. This has the potential of introducing transformative change in the robotics industry, and to industrial automation in general. Furthermore, the controls knowledge gained from this research can be extended to many electric servo systems and to industrial control systems in general. Two market segments will be targeted: robotics and general motion control (GMC), both estimated at $7 billion. If software, peripherals and systems engineering are included, the robotics market is estimated at $19 billion. Both the robotics and GMC industries significantly support the national economy with applications ranging from manufacturing and food processing, to medical advances such as remotely controlled surgery, and to national defense. Well-paying new hi-tech jobs are created in engineering and technical services. This research will develop new applications in robotics and industrial automation, educational STEM opportunities, enhanced scientific and technological understanding, making the U.S. more competitive globally.",

Since malaria deaths occur within 48 hours of onset of symptoms, the ability to manage malaria at home or in village settings where most cases occur would (i) facilitate prompt access to antimalarial treatment, (ii) target treatment to those who need it, and (iii) reduce malaria mortality. In this project, monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to novel poly-asparagine protein fragments identified in the urine of febrile malaria patients will be used to develop a UMT-Pf/Pv dipstick. The four overlapping specific aims are to (1) perform a detailed characterization of the diagnostic utility of MAbs developed in Phase I; (2) develop, test and optimize a prototype to meet design input specifications; (3) implement preliminary performance evaluation studies to evaluate sensitivity/specificity, and; (4)undertake preliminary clinical testing. As a non-invasive alternative to blood-based tests, the UMT-Pf/Pv could facilitate the delivery of rapid malaria diagnosis in settings across all geographical areas where malaria is endemic, markedly impacting the way malaria is diagnosed and treated worldwide. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the development of a broad-based one-step urine test for the home-based or point-of-care diagnosis of clinical Pf and/or Pv malaria in persons with fever. With the UMT-Pf/Pv dipstick, the number of steps that the operator is required to perform is significantly reduced, permitting greater utility, convenience and reliability in primary care settings. The test will also facilitate the effective integration of malaria RDTs into private sector malaria case management and encourage wider acceptability of clinical malaria diagnosis in endemic regions, especially in rural areas and in places where mixed infections frequently occur. Overall, the test has the potential to markedly impact the way over 95% of all clinical malaria is diagnosed and treated, and drive current global efforts toward home-based or point-of-care testing for malaria prior to treatment in all cases of fever, as mandated by the World Health Organization. Since it is based on the same platform as current RDTs, this test can be easily integrated into current healthcare structures to provide significant benefits to public health in most endemic countries.

The commercially available sodium-beta batteries are all constructed with BASE tubes having wall thickness of over 2 millimeters to maintain the battery mechanical integrity, thus leading to relatively low specific energy densities and large thermal masses that inhibit fast thermal cycling. The primary objective of this program is to overcome the limitations of the state-of-the-art sodium- beta battery technologies by the development of an advanced battery with a thin planar architecture. High performance Na-BASE discs possessing high strength and high resistance to moisture and CO2 attack will be developed and manufactured using the MSRI?s patented vapor phase process.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to develop novel products for routine genetic testing by demonstrating feasibility of an innovative technology called Autoligation Chain Reaction (ACR). The intellectual merit of ACR is an enabling nucleic acid amplification technology that requires no nucleotides or enzymes. Polymerase inhibitors are found in many laboratory samples and clinical specimens, and contribute to the high cost of molecular-based assays in routine genetic tests because labor-intensive sample preparation and assay development are required to optimize around these inhibitors with current molecular technologies. Because ACR does not involve any reagents sensitive to polymerase inhibitors, the requirement for sample preparation is expected to be low and overall assay development and testing turnaround times are expected to be much faster. Specific key research objectives of the project include design and synthesis of thermal-stable ACR reagents, and the demonstration that ACR can exponentially amplify DNA target sequences without enzymes or nucleotides. Research will be carried out using low copy-number target nucleic acid sequences containing bio-relevant SNPs across multiple loci. The anticipated technical results should show robust, specific, and reproducible amplifications of multiple SNPs on multiple loci in the absence of enzymes or nucleotides. What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity? The broader impact/commercial potential of this project, if successful, is the innovation of an enabling technology that could dramatically reduce sample preparation and assay optimization times, and significantly increase the efficiency and quality, and lower the cost of clinical diagnostics and routine genetic testing. Since non-enzymatic amplification coupled with the inherent simplicity of ACR makes this technology more amenable to standardization in clinical and lab settings across different sample types than existing molecular technologies, it is expected that ACR technology will drive the development of a new generation of molecular diagnostic and screening products. These products are expected to provide more efficient, simpler, cheaper, faster, and accurate routine genetic testing of a broad range of biomarkers for a wide range of diseases and genetic disorders, including those currently unattainable by traditional molecular methods. As a result, ACR will potentially not only advance the understanding of diseases at the genetic level, but also bring broader benefits to human health and society at large through enhanced biomedical discovery, diagnostics, and personalized medicine.",

        "abstract": "Field Sanitation Centers typically convert 240 gallons of potable water per day into greywater. This greywater must then be transported off-site or properly disposed of on-site. To alleviate this problem, a continuous process to treat the greywater produced is needed.

Mainstream will also develop manufacturing and commercialization plans in Phase II so Phase III commercialization can occur additional development costs.",

An operator warning interface will alert the operator when various limits are approached, exercising the actual sensor hardware and generating sensor data without any approximations that would be required in a sensor simulation. Effects such as material properties, angle of incidence, and size of the object being imaged all play a role in the quality of the sensor returns that a simulation may not capture, reducing integration risk in preparation for a future flight test program in a follow on Phase II effort. Additional obscurants such as fog or smoke will be used to test the performance and accuracy of the sensor package.",

        "abstract": "Directed Energy (DE) systems offer the promise of dramatic improvements in capability for self defense and area defense systems along with an enhanced precision strike and engagement capability.  Unfortunately, turbulence causes the beam to break up at the target, significantly limiting the range of DE systems and limiting their availability to benign turbulence conditions.  Adaptive Optical (AO) systems offer the promise to mitigate the impact of turbulence, increasing the effective range of DE systems and improving availability.  However, for nearly all military applications with noncooperative targets, if the turbulence is so severe that AO is needed, then the current state of the art in AO is no longer effective for turbulence correction.  A measurement method that enables wavefront sensing and correction in Deep Turbulence is required. Nutronics has developed and demonstrated in the laboratory an innovative beam control approach for compensation in the Deep Turbulence regime: the Adaptive Tactical Laser System (ATLAS).  AFRL/RDS and DARPA funded a laboratory demonstration effort that established the capability of ATLAS to effectively form a point source beacon at the target.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The Phase II SBIR program aims to fabricate, test and qualify carbon nanotube based thermal interface materials (TIMs) suitable for use on an Air Force spacecraft mission. Traditional TIMs consist of filled epoxies or rubbers that can be hazardous, time-consuming, and difficult to rework when required.  The new class of carbon nanotube based TIMs being developed in the current SBIR program is highly compliant, reliable, reworkable and easy to handle.  These attributes promise significant reduction of the assembly, integration, and test time (AI &amp; T) for the electronics onboard of the spacecrafts. In the Phase I program, CTD has successfully demonstrating the feasibility of the new generation of TIMs that consists of CNT arrays grown on both sides of a thin metal substrate.   Thermal conductance of the TIM as measured by CTD far exceeds the target of 575 W/m2K set forth at the beginning of the program.  In the proposed Phase II program CTD, in collaboration with industry partners, will conduct outgassing, thermal cycling and system level thermal characterization testing of the TIMs. The goal is to transition the technology into scaled production and to provide Air Force with space qualified CNT based TIMs.  BENEFIT:  Carbon nanotube (CNT) based TIMs have high thermal conductance at very low contact pressure and do not degrade when mechanically deformed. Also, CNT array interfaces are dry and chemically stable from cryogenic to elevated temperatures, simplifying installation and preventing thermal pump-out. Assembly, integration, and test time (AI &amp; T) for CNT TIMs can be significantly reduced in comparison to liquid or adhesive TIMs.  In addition, CNT TIMs are not bonded between the surfaces and do not require sealing adhesive, therefore rework and replacement time for units is significantly reduced. Because of these advantages, CNT TIMs are likely to find commercial applications in spacecraft electronics, military aircraft electronics, RF systems for space as well as electronics for electrical power conversion, handling and conditioning.",

The sensor is designed around the AIM-9X imager  produced by Raytheon Missile Systems. Phase I research focused on  methods of improving the already narrow solar exclusion angle of the  LSIS system. In Phase II we propose to further investigate uncertainties  in the results of the Phase I experiments. Furthermore, we propose to  significantly mature the LSIS system in three ways. First, bolstered by  the experience of SAIC, we will investigate image processing algorithms  for use in the LSIS systems. Second, we will redeploying the control  software to a non-radiation-hardened version of the intended flight  hardware. Finally, we will integrate with a  gigabit ethernet version of the LSIS Imager interface provided by  Raytheon. With these improvements in place, we will further demonstrate  the basic operation of LSIS.  BENEFIT:  This Phase II work will significantly mature the LSIS hardware and software. Upon completion of the proposed Phase II work the likely first product would be a flight-demonstration version of the LSIS sensor to prove feasibility and capability in a limited-scope space mission.  A flight-ready hardware system could be assembled in 18-24 months that would be capable of demonstrating the instrument&quot;s core performance.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  High-speed inter-satellite links (ISLs) are a key feature to improving satellite communications (SATCOM) bandwidth in support of global military operations. ISLs increase the number of paths in the network which tend to improve aggregate bandwidth, network survivability, and improve the global instantaneous transmission coverage. Along with expanding network ground coverage, ISLs provide saving in ground system operations costs by reducing the number of ground stations and relay points required to maintain a satellite constellation while still providing improved coverage. The SEAKR team will work toward implementing a space-qualified inter-satellite crosslink utilizing a novel hybrid optical/radio frequency (RF) direct modulation technique.  This approach leverages bandwidth advantages of optical systems while presenting a modulated RF output consistent with spacecraft manufacturers design know how.  BENEFIT:  This activity provides spacecraft designers another option for satellite crosslink architecture and design.  Satellite crosslink capability will facilitate a network approach for satellite mission operations.  Regardless of satellite mission type, fully cross-linked satellite constellations enable a host of concept of operations (CONOPS) ranging from network centric operations to load balancing to simplification of ground station footprints.  The primary benefit of this hybrid architecture is the achievement of high data rates via a low risk unit-level technology insertion versus new subsystem and spacecraft design modifications required by other design alternatives.  Along with the low risk of the technology insertion approach, comes lower cost and shorter timelines to initial operations while preserving pre-planned product improvements (P3I) for even higher data rates.",

        "abstract": "One of the most important numerical problems in science and engineering is that of finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of large-scale matrices. Methods for the solution of these problems, usually called eigensolvers, are fundamental to many industrial and scientific applications ranging from computational chemistry problems to structural design, to other modeling- and simulation- intense disciplines that are at the core of DOEs scientific priorities, such as weather prediction, nuclear energy, nuclear weapon certification, and wind turbine design, among many others. Scientists working in these areas are always striving for increased computational performance. Modern heterogeneous supercomputing architectures (made of arbitrary combinations of CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, and possibly other types of cores) could provide the computational performance needed by large-scale eigensolvers. However, increasing performance in eigensolvers through heterogeneous computing is hard to achieve. The reason is that most eigensolvers and numerical software scale inefficiently when targeted to a large number of processors due to (1) communication becoming a primary burden, and (2) this burden being aggravated when transitioning into heterogeneous high-speed architectures. No industrial-quality scalable eigensolver library exists today that can efficiently exploit modern heterogeneous cores to deliver breakthrough speedups for eigenvalue-centric computations. Accelogic proposes to deploy the worlds fastest eigensolver numerical library, equipped to exploit heterogeneous HPC systems made of arbitrary combinations of CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, and possibly other types of cores integrated in the same supercomputing network. We propose two major innovations to attack the above-mentioned hurdles by: (1) implementing communication-avoiding eigensolver algorithms; and (2) introducing innovative approaches to guarantee scaling based on talent-aware heterogeneous load-balancing. Talent-aware heterogeneous load- balancing exploits the abilities that different computing cores have to execute particular numerical tasks. Accelogic has raised private sector matching funds tied to this SBIR project for an additional $1,000,000  such an investment is a testament to the strong commercialization potential of the proposed technology. The Phase I work demonstrated more than 10x acceleration factors for both direct and iterative solvers, in both single-processor and distributed environments. This result establishes the perfect foundation for a successful Phase II effort, which targets the first release of an industrial library of eigensolvers designed for heterogeneous HPC systems. The resulting library is expected to provide from two to three orders of magnitude speedups compared against existing eigensolver solutions. It will incorporate both direct (dense) and iterative (sparse) eigensolvers. A strong emphasis of the project is on achieving successful integration with high-impact HPC software, producing, shortly after the end of Phase II, breakthrough acceleration for a wide number of users.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  This technology will have potentially large impact in industries such as structural design, chemistry, bioengineering, and computational physics, as well as in DOEs research programs in fusion energy, climate/weather modeling, nanoscale science, genomics, and study of nuclear matter, among many others.",

To reach the mid-IR wavelengths for ESASE application, the traditional way is to shift the wavelengths of these commercially available ultrafast pulse laser systems to the wavelengths of 2m or longer with substantial cost-ineffective efforts. It is of great interest to generate high energy femtosecond pulses at 2m directly from thulium (Tm) - doped fiber lasers and amplifiers. AdValue Photonics proposes a high-energy 2m femtosecond fiber CPA laser system that could deliver 5mJ pulses with pulse duration of &amp; lt;100 fs at the repetition rate of 10 kHz for ESASE application, which start from an environmentally stable mode-locked Tm-doped all-fiber oscillator. An extra large-mode-area heavily-Tm-doped solid-core silicate Bragg fiber with 100-m core diameter will be used as the main amplifier which boosts the pulse energy to mJ level and maintains effective single-mode operation. We successfully demonstrated 2m mode-locked fiber laser with spectral width of greater than 50nm, which can be compressed to &amp; lt;100fs and amplified pulse energy to larger than 5J. We successfully fabricated a Bragg fiber, which guides at 2m. Both experimental and simulation results show that the objectives of this proposal is realistic and achievable.  We shall develop deliverable prototype 2m mode-locked fiber laser that delivers 5mJ pulses with pulse duration of &amp; lt;100fs at the repetition rate of 10 kHz.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  Our proposed technology will boost 2m fiber lasers to a new high-energy level. This high energy ultrafast infrared light source will benefit many processes and phenomena in high intensity physics, such as photo-fragmentation and Coulomb explosion in atomic clusters.

        "abstract": "This project aims to increase the reliability of radio frequency (RF) devices used in accelerator facilities by reducing/eliminating corrosion and erosion produced from the high purity de-ionized water cooling systems.  Although  metal  interconnects  are  required  for  electrical  and  thermal  performance,  they susceptible to two major failure mechanisms, corrosion and erosion. Currently RF loads are purchased with anticorrosion coating, which must be re-applied as routine preventative maintenance. In addition to costs of coatings, accelerator down time is a significant expense. By reducing maintenance costs of current accelerator components, more resources can be focused on conducting research. The proposed approach will use atomic layer deposition (ALD) to deposit highly uniform ceramic thin films onto the metalized surfaces susceptible to the corrosion and erosion. Since ceramics are inert and hard, the ALD coating will provide corrosion resistance and erosion protection, thereby increasing reliability. The RF load surface will be treated with an organic self assembled monolayer (SAM) prior to ALD. The SAM will provide an ideal surface for ALD bonding, improve uniformity by masking surface defects in the metal, and provide compliance for coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) mismatch. This innovative metal-organic-ceramic combination will extend the useable life of water cooled RF devices. During the Phase I program, a ceramic coating formulation and ALD parameters (temperature, pressure) were identified that showed superior performance to the baseline. The nanometer thickness coating performance was analyzed by comparing the ALD coated sample with bare copper, nickel-gold plated copper (Cu/Ni/Au) and stainless steel sample. The samples were subjected to the following four tests: corrosion, erosion, thermal oxidation and thermal cycling. In all the four tests, the ALD coating showed improved performance (by an order of magnitude in terms of corrosion resistance). Advanced Cooling Technologies Inc.  (ACT)  has partnered with Calabazas Creek Research Inc. to develop the RF load used in DOE accelerator facility with ALD coating for corrosion and erosion resistance. In addition, ACT has partnered with Communications and Power Industries Inc. to solve a similar corrosion-erosion problem in the copper cooling channels of RF traveling wave tubes (TWT). ACT plans to reach a technology readiness level (TRL) of 5 for RF loads and 6 for TWT. A follow-on Phase III commercialization plan is presented in the proposal.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  Currently, corrosion and erosion are leading causes of failure in water cooled RF devices. The coating process developed is this Phase I SBIR will reduce maintenance costs and downtime of DOE accelerator facilities. This process is not only applicable to cooling loops in accelerator facilities, but all copper-water cooling systems that suffer from corrosion and erosion.",

There are no existing field deployable instruments for the sensitive, real time measurement of the isotopologues of carbon monoxide. This proposal directly addresses the solicitations call for a field deployable CO isotope monitor under topic 29b, item (4). The proposed CO isotope monitor will couple room temperature continuous wave quantum cascade lasers with advanced infrared detectors and new optical designs for longer absorption path length in a compact instrument. The resulting instrument will simultaneously measure the isotopic ratios of 13CO and C18O with excellent precision in real time (one minute resolution). We project isotopic ratio precisions of 0.25 per mil and 1.5 per mil for 13CO and C18O, respectively, for a typical ambient CO mixing ratio of 200 ppb. The resulting instrument will be compact, portable, autonomous and field ready. The successful Phase I results demonstrated sensitive measurement of the CO isotopologues, 13CO, C18O, and CO in a 204 m absorption cell. Isotopic ratio precisions for 13CO and C18O to 12C16O of 0.4 per mil and 3.6 per mil, respectively, were obtained with a real time cw quantum cascade laser instrument. The laser was operating at a less than ideal wavelength due to the time constraints in Phase I. A preliminary design for the Phase II instrument was developed which includes obtaining lasers that operate at the ideal wavelengths. In the first year of the project, design improvements in optical and electronics will lead to production of a sensitive portable instrument for simultaneously monitoring multiple CO isotopologues. The resulting instrument will be applied in the second year to both laboratory and field measurements to evaluate CO isotopic signatures of atmospheric sources. Additional commercial applications of the monitor will be studied including the development of a pre-concentration method to allow the study of rare isotopic species like C17O and 13C18O. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: This instrument will provide atmospheric scientists with scientifically meaningful isotopic ratio measurements in real time, without pre-concentration and without cryogenic cooling of either laser or detector. Other applications of this technology include air pollution monitoring, human breath analysis, and industrial process monitoring. This technology will provide a significant societal benefit through improved understanding and mitigation of global warming and global climate change.",

        "abstract": "Aerosol particles have important impacts on visibility, acid deposition, climate, and human health, although large uncertainties remain in quantifying their chemical composition and atmospheric transformations. A large fraction of the anthropogenic aerosol is generated from energy- related activities, and organic compounds are known to constitute a significant fraction of ambient aerosol mass. Recently discovered discrepancies between measurements of organic aerosol mass and predictions from large scale atmospheric models suggest that our understanding of the sources of secondary organic aerosol is incomplete. This SBIR Phase II project addresses the critical need for the improved chemical characterization of organic aerosol in the atmosphere. This problem will be addressed through the development and testing of a novel instrument that combines separation of particulate organics based on volatility and polarity with high-resolution electron impact ionization mass spectrometry, allowing the identification of individual compounds, as well as measurement of key chemical characteristics, such as the oxygen-to- carbon ratio. Particles will be collected on an impactor and thermally desorbed into the detector. Temperature control of the sample desorption process will give information on the volatility of the organic compounds, a crucial element in understanding gas to particle conversion in the atmosphere. Desorbed material will pass through a short gas chromatography column and be separated based on polarity, another key property for molecular identification. The combination of volatility, polarity and high resolution mass spectrometry data will provide inputs to atmospheric models and improve our understanding of the sources and transformations of organic aerosol. The Phase I project succesfully demonstrated the feasibility of the instrumental approach. The ability to separate organic aerosol constituents on both a volatility and polarity basis was demonstrated and optimized through laboratory experiments. The volatility and polarity separated material was successfully detected with a high resolution mass spectrometer. During Phase II, a commercial version of the instrument will be developed. Specific tasks include improving temperature control of the collection and transfer components, developing new data acquisition and data analysis tools, and developing automatic calibration procedures. The new instrument will be tested in the laboratory and in a field deployment where results can be compared and contrasted with other measurement techniques. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  The primary market for this instrument will be atmospheric research groups at universities and national laboratories, including DOE facilities. In addition, the instrument will be well-suited for environmental monitoring, as well as for the characterization of emissions from a variety of industrial and energy production processes. The instrument developed in this program will yield a significant level of direct commercial sales and contract field measurements in the atmospheric science and environmental pollution research and development communities.",

        "abstract": "Gas phase nitric acid (HNO3) is an important aerosol precursor that is coupled to the removal of natural and anthropogenic NOx from the atmosphere.  HNO3 is highly soluble and is extremely effective at increasing the cloud droplet number density, and has been implicated in the reduction of average cloud droplet size which increases cloud albedo.  It can also decrease precipitation and increase the effective cloud coverage.  Direct measurements of HNO3 that are accurate, interference free, sensitive and rapid are needed to support particulate nitrate aerosol studies. The proposed instrument development will produce a robust approach for measuring HNO3 using newly developed infrared quantum cascade lasers.  This will provide a major advancement over current commercial instrument capabilities. This technology will yield a sensitive, selective measurement of this important aerosol precursor in measurement campaigns and at remote clean air monitoring stations. A prototype instrument using state of art quantum cascade lasers was used for simultaneous detection of both HNO3 and NH3 at the targeted sensitivity of 30 ppt (parts-per- trillion) in one second and averaging to less than 10 ppt in 100s.  The inlet effects for sampling and particle separation were assessed, and the design improvements for Phase II were initiated. The results are extremely promising and are among the highest precision yet achieved for HNO3. Design improvements in optics and electronics will lead to the production of a more robust and sensitive instrument.  Improved design of the gas phase inlet will minimize surface reactivity and improve gas-particle separation.  The resulting instrument will be applied to both laboratory and field measurements in conjunction with an aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) to evaluate particle formation mechanisms from aerosol precursors. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: The proposed instrument will provide the capability to measure atmospheric abundances of HNO3 in real time in order to better assess nitrogen oxide chemistry resulting in tropospheric ozone production and subsequent aerosol and cloud modifications.  Improved understanding of aerosol and cloud properties will improve our understanding of global climate change and help evaluate mitigation strategies.  There is a worldwide market for such measurement systems in the environmental and aerosol research communities.",

It is now recognized that the atmospheric  loading  of  aerosols  can  exert  an  influence  on  the  earths  radiation  budget  comparable  in magnitude with greenhouse gases.  However, the uncertainties in the current understanding of aerosol direct and indirect forcing limit the ability to quantify human influences on climate change. We  are  developing  a  particle  single  scattering  albedo  monitor  employing  Aerodynes  patented  Cavity Attenuated Phase Shift technology that combines extinction and scattering measurements in one instrument with rapid time-response, and high sensitivity and accuracy.  It will operate at a single wavelength which can range from the near infrared (800 nm,) to the near- ultraviolet (365 nm) region of the spectrum. A prototype version of the single scattering albedo monitor was built and its properties investigated including determining its sensitivity, time response and response to test particles as a function of particle size for a number chemical species including polystyrene latex, ammonium sulfate and nigrosin dye.  Operation of the extinction component in the near infrared (780 nm) and near-ultraviolet (365 nm) was demonstrated. The Phase II will focus on designing,   building   and testing a commercial   version of the monitor. Improvements in accuracy specifically related to the effects of particle size will be a major emphasis. The monitor  will  be  deployed  as  part  of  extensive  field  measurement  campaigns  in  conjunction  with  other researchers in order to assess its field worthiness, an extremely important factor in developing a market for the instrument. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  Successful development and marketing of this monitor will yield a significant level of direct commercial sales from the atmospheric sciences and environmental pollution research and development communities.

These issues, along with plans for plant life extension, have prompted the industry to actively seek viable options to monitor the health of these systems in order to ensure reliable plant operation for decades to come. This proposed work offers a comprehensive research and development effort to apply on-line condition monitoring and advanced diagnostics to the rod control systems of existing and new nuclear power plants. The primary product of this project will be a prototype rod control diagnostic system that will take advantage of existing test points inside current-generation rod control system cabinets to continuously monitor for abnormal events and component degradation. In Phase I, the feasibility of a rod control diagnostic system was established by obtaining rod control data from a nuclear power plant during rod movement. This data was used to develop algorithms that identify common rod control system problems. In Phase II, these algorithms will be further developed to provide real-time diagnostic capabilities for identifying a variety of common problems encountered by the industry including electronic card failures; logic errors; timing, latching and rod movement problems; and control rod drive mechanism coil and cable degradation. These  issues  have  led  to  reactor  trips,  unplanned  shutdowns,  and  extended refueling outages that resulted in millions of dollars in lost industry revenue and increased costs of electricity for the public.

After the prototype system has been implemented in one or more facilities, a design for a commercial system will be produced.  In addition to the existing fleet, the proposing firm will also develop the design for implementing the technology in the next generation of nuclear power plants.  This technology can be deployed to pressurized water reactors as a complete system, individual diagnostic modules, or it can be used by the proposing firm under a service contract as measurement and test equipment.

        "abstract": "The dramatic increase in development and usage of nanostructured materials has left a critical characterization gap in the ability to chemically identify and map materials with nanoscale spatial resolution. Anasys Instruments proposes to develop a high speed Wideband Infrared NanoSpectroscopy (WINS) platform that will dramatically extend the available capabilities for chemical characterization at the nanoscale. Closing this characterization gap through successful completion of this project will accelerate the development of novel nanoscale materials as well as providing critical analytical capabilities to basic materials science.  During Phase I, the WINS project developed and demonstrated a broad range of technologies to overcome previous technology barriers and enable wideband, high resolution infrared spectroscopy at the nanoscale, specifically: (1) a new widely tunable mid-infrared laser source meeting key market performance needs; (2) dynamic beam control capabilities including arbitrary polarization control (breakthrough new capability for studying oriented polymers) along with dynamic beam angle and power control; (3) a new atomic force microscope (AFM) based infrared nanospectroscopy platform, including high resolution scattering scanning near field optical microscopy  (s-SNOM) measurements. This Phase II project will build on the success of Phase I activities to develop and commercialize wideband infrared nano-spectroscopy.  This new WINS platform will employ AFM-based techniques that use the probe of an AFM to detect absorption or scattering of infrared radiation by a sample just under the AFM probe tip. Specifically in Phase II the proposers will develop a commercial WINS platform prototype incorporating: (1) Interchangeable, broadly and rapidly tunable infrared (IR) sources; (2) A dynamic beam control module to provide IR excitation with optimal power, position and desired polarization to the sample; (3) Capabilities for mapping molecular orientation in oriented polymers; (4) A new AFM nanospectroscopy platform suitable for IR spectroscopy, s-SNOM and other spectroscopic applications. This project is anticipated to have far reaching impacts. Infrared spectroscopy is arguably the most widely used technique for chemical characterization, but spatial resolution limits have prevented it from being widely applied at the nanoscale.  Scattering SNOM and Raman are both techniques with significant potential, but various barriers have prevented broad adoption. By overcoming these barriers, this project will give researchers a robust capability to leverage the power of infrared spectroscopy over broad wavelength ranges and at resolution scales well below current limits.  The WINS platform will enable a wide range of high resolution characterization in materials science and life sciences including correlation of morphological, chemical, mechanical and optical properties. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: Based on market experience, we anticipate significant downstream benefits in areas including the development of advanced polymer materials, automotive materials, photovoltaics, materials for biofuels, and many other areas.",

        "abstract": "The Internet and computers are a part of our daily life and data storage is an important element in both. Over the years compute power has increased significantly but high speed, economical data storage has been lacking.  Today, concerns range from how fast can information be accessed, how much storage is required, and the energy costs to operate data storage equipment and facilities. More than 60% of the energy used by storage hardware goes to keep disks in a hard disk drive spinning.  The thick disks used in these products dictate the energy consumption and limit the number of platters that can be mounted in each unit.  The objective of this research is to replace the thick disks with very thin titanium platters to significantly reduce inertia.  The unit can now be powered on/off decreasing energy consumption.  Many more disks can be housed in each unit increasing storage capacity, and the device can be started rapidly achieving high speeds for faster data throughput.  The work performed during Phase I showed the potential of achieving greater than 3X more storage per watt of power consumed.  In Phase II prototypes will be fabricated to demonstrate recording density, and a manufacturing process will be developed. The objective in this study is to replace the thick disk substrate and keep all other components in the hard disk drive unchanged to allow for easy adoption of the technology. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  If this project is successful it will provide customers and manufacturers of storage hardware a choice to select this technology versus conventional hard disks.  The new disk will be marketed installed in storage products and the technology will be available for licensing.  Additionally, slimmer disk drives that can operate with low voltage batteries and power sources in portable appliances can be developed.",

        "abstract": "At the present time, carbon fiber tanks are very expensive, with the high pressure vessel industry standard Toray T700 carbon fiber costing between $20 and $50 per kilogram alone. At this high price, the carbon fiber currently comprises as much as 75% of the overall tank cost and is a major roadblock on the path to commercialization. To make hydrogen fuel cells in early market and light-duty vehicles commercially viable, the cost of carbon fiber or the amount of carbon fiber used must be significantly reduced. One effective way to lower the weight, thus decreasing the carbon fiber usage and lowering the cost, of a CFRP tank is to improve the mechanical properties of the CFRP composite resin matrix using nano-reinforcement. Using the resin matrix itself as a source of composite strength, along with the carbon fiber reinforcement, results in a tank that requires less carbon fiber material. This solution decreases the weight of the tank while preserving or even increasing its performance. The overall goal of this two phase program is to improve the mechanical properties of the epoxy matrix ( &amp; gt;60% improvement in strength and &amp; gt;100% improvement in modulus) utilizing NH2- functionalized CNT reinforcement. The goal is to reduce the weight of the CFRP portion of hydrogen fuel tanks by 40% while maintaining or increasing the performance when compared to hydrogen fuel tanks at standard weight without CNT reinforcement. The ultimate target is to significantly lower the expense of the carbon fiber (~40% cost reduction). The reduced weight of the hydrogen fuel tanks will make this possible. In the DOE SBIR Phase I program, our approach was successful in that we achieved a 52% improvement in compression strength and a 63% improvement in compression modulus in the epoxy matrix using NH2-functionalized CNTs. Tensile and flexural properties were also significantly improved. We were not able to achieve a hydrogen fuel tank with significantly lightened weight. Due to the increased viscosity of the CNT reinforced epoxy resin compared with the neat epoxy, the CNT reinforced epoxy resin did not penetrate and adhere to the carbon fibers during the filament winding portion of the tank fabrication process. But we firmly believe that this issue can be resolved in the Phase II program. We used a surfactant to lower the viscosity of the CNT reinforced epoxy and checked the mechanical performance of the CFRP ring. Very promising results were achieved. In the Phase II program, we will further improve the mechanical properties of the CNT reinforced epoxy, modify the process for fabricating the CNT reinforced tanks with reduced weight based on both 5,000 and 10,000 psi pressures and perform more sophisticated testing on then. Most importantly, the CNT reinforced epoxy resin with significantly improved mechanical properties has the possibility to revolutionize the entire composite industry. With substantially increased strength properties using CNT reinforcement, the end product will be significantly stronger and lighter than conventional CFRP/GFRP composites currently used in many applications including hydrogen fuel tanks. Customers in all industries will be able to make their existing products, using their existing production methods, substantially lighter, stronger, faster, and consequently, greener.",

        "abstract": "So-called tabletop accelerators are a holy-grail of high energy/high field physics and, if developed, as indicated by the Department of Energy in the Accelerators for America report, will spur a revolution in particle physics discoveries and also in medical treatments. This is because planned next-generation particle accelerators are still kilometers in size and billions of dollars to build and support, and therefore are only within reach of large research consortia as opposed to typical research Institutions or Universities. In order to address this gap in technology, laser-plasma accelerators have been proposed and demonstrated to accelerate high-charge; high-brightness bunches of electrons to more than 100 MeV, in less than 1 cm. However, while these recent acceleration results have generated enormous international interest and stimulated investigations of laser-plasma acceleration as viable acceleration stages, there are several barriers to practical implementation such as the very low repetition rates (1 shot per second or less), large size, and high cost. To address these issues, we propose a tabletop laser-based accelerator in which a number of fiber lasers are combined to pump an Optical Parametric Chirped Pulse Amplifier capable of generating high energy ultrashort pulses at high repetition rates. This solution increases the repetition rate by several orders of magnitude, and provides with a much more practical laser for driving a laser plasma accelerator. During Phase I a novel fiber laser array system design based on a new method for combining multiple fiber lasers have been developed which allows achieving high pulse energies with relatively few combined amplification channels, thus providing substantially smaller system size and cost. In this Phase II SBIR proposal, this Phase I design will be used to experimentally demonstrate a compact and high average power laser front end capable of driving high energy electron-beam particle accelerators at high repetition rates. This technology holds the potential to one day make compact, tabletop-sized accelerators a reality, and to dramatically increase the rate of acceleration possible with traditional high energy particle accelerators without dramatic increases in machine dimensions. Compact, plasma wakefield particle accelerators would be significantly more economical than current RF-based machines, putting them within reach of a much larger range of university and institutional research labs for basic research and medical applications. Furthermore, the constituent fiber lasers used to pump the optical parametric chirped pulse amplifier scheme can become stand- alone products for use in a variety of material processing tasks, spanning microelectronic and solar device processing.",

        "abstract": "Recognizing the advantages of energy storage flywheels in rapid-response, high cycle-life applications, ARPA-E has funded Beacon Power to develop critical components for a low cost flying ring hub-less flywheel under the GRIDS program. The funded system will provide 100 kW for 1 hour for firming and smoothing of intermittent-renewable power generation. The goal is to reduce the cost per kWh by a factor of 8. For this large, low-cost flywheel to be applicable to either Frequency Regulation or Frequency Response applications, the motor/generator capability will need to be increased to 400 kW. The permanent magnet motor/generator (PMMG) configuration proposed in the ARPA-E project is based upon the use of bonded magnets (which give up a significant amount of remnant flux density (Br) in exchange for strain capability) together with a stator with no back-iron (and so, no negative spring constant).  The questions for the SBIR project are: 1. Can some of this Br be regained with other bonded magnet materials and/or processes? 2. Can the bearing system be designed to accommodate the negative stiffness from adding back-iron? 3. Is the resulting stator size reasonable? and 4. Can the losses in the resulting high-power design be dissipated? The Phase I effort has resulted in a 400 kW motor/generator design using the same rotor magnet and stator winding as the ARPA-E design. The 4 times increase in power has been achieved with a combination of concentrating the magnetic field by adding some iron to the stator, and with additional cooling of the stator winding. The proposed Phase II project is to demonstrate that the design approach developed during Phase I will achieve the required four-times improvement in power capability for the motor/generator. This will involve building a full-scale version of the machine, and obtaining operational test data up to  rated speed on a dynamometer.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: The new high-power motor/generator will make it possible to commercialize at least six major energy balancing grid-scale applications at a cost equal to one-fourth the cost of our current Gen4 flywheel that is currently operating in our 20 MW Frequency Regulation plant in Stephentown, NY. These are: 1. Frequency Regulation and Frequency Response; 2. Primary and Secondary Reserve, which is what Europe and parts of the rest of the world use to balance system frequency; 3. Super Primary Response, a derivative of our core technology that can replace conventional spinning reserve for event contingencies; 4. ramp mitigation for solar PV; 5. load following and ramp mitigation for wind-diesel-storage hybrid applications; and 6. micro grid stabilization.",

Toward hydrogen economy, an innovation in hydrogen separation technology is needed in the production of hydrogen. Current separation technologies for industrial hydrogen production mainly include pressure swing adsorption process and the cryogenic separation process, which are complicated and energy intensive. Membrane separation in hydrogen production and purification holds the substantial key to the economic viability of our national hydrogen energy systems because of low energy consumption, possibility for continuous operation, its ease of operation, and ultimately cost effectiveness. A novel, robust, high temperature hydrogen separation membrane with high H2 selectivity and permeability, excellent hydrothermal and chemical stability, and excellent durability in the harsh operating conditions will be developed in this program. The composite membrane can be combined with water-gas- shift (WGS) reaction in a membrane reactor system. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: In short term, this novel hydrogen separation technology can be used for industrial hydrogen separation to produce high purity hydrogen gas. It can also be used to treat the flue gas from various chemical processes, such as ammonia synthesis, to recapture the hydrogen. Once fully developed, such membrane could be combined with WGS reaction as one of the key components in coal gasification and steam reforming processes, producing hydrogen and other high-value chemicals with near zero emissions. The membrane reactor for WGS reaction may thus lead to substantial  simplifications  of  the  process  and  reduction  of  energy  consumption  for  H2 production. Clearly, a novel, robust, high selective and flux, high temperature membrane separation technology will provide tremendous economical, environmental benefits for the general public.",

        "abstract": "Advanced high power microwave sources are required for future high energy accelerators. Typical requirements are 10 MW pulses with 65% efficiency and a beam voltage of 120 kV or lower. This implies a beam purveyance of about 4 micropervs. With this purveyance, it is impossible to achieve the required efficiency with a conventional klystron. Calabazas Creek Research Inc. is developing a 10 MW, 1.3 GHz annular beam klystron (ABK). The ABK uses an annular beam to reduce space charge depression and reduce the operating voltage.   The ABK will achieve similar performance as multiple beam klystrons, but at significantly lower cost. The program will demonstrate a major advance in high power klystrons that will be applicable to a wide range of frequencies and powers. A previous program developed preliminary design that achieved the required specifications. This Phase I program focused on verification that beam instabilities would not prevent successful operation. Extensive analysis and computer simulations indicate the ABK should be absolutely stable and provide the required performance. The ABK design will be finalized and a full power device will be built and tested. The design will be further modified to improve performance and reduce cost. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  The ABKs relatively simple geometry will reduce fabrication costs while providing equivalent performance to multiple beam devices.  Klystrons are used in accelerators for research and medical applications, and for radar and communications and the defense systems.  The ABK offers a significant cost advantage over competing RF sources, currently produced in Europe and Japan. This would reestablish the U.S. as the leader in higher power RF sources for accelerators and similar systems.",

        "abstract": "Current high power gyrotrons are restricted to single frequency operation with output in a Gaussian quasi-optical mode. The output requires an expensive Mirror Optical Unit (MOU) to couple the quasi-optical RF beam into corrugated waveguide. This adds approximately $500,000 to the system cost. This program is employing an innovative technique to couple RF power directly into corrugated waveguide inside the gyrotron. This reduces the diameter of the RF beam and allows implementation of a Brewster angle window. It also eliminates the requirement for an MOU, saving users approximately $500,000 per gyrotron. The operation of the direct coupler was confirmed by low power testing during the Phase I pro- gram. A Brewster window was designed, built, and successfully tested. The program initiated an upgrade to the computational tools to increase the bandwidth of the direct coupler. Upgrade of the design codes will be completed and a broadband coupler built for high power testing. The coupler will be initially tested in the experimental gyrotron at MIT. The Brewster angle window will be initially tested with the MIT gyrotron, and then tested at high average power using a gyrotron at General Atomics.Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: High power RF sources are desired for improved heating and instability suppression in most all tokamak devices. If successfully developed, this coupler and window would likely be implemented in all future, high power, gyrotrons in the U.S., Europe, and Asia.

The goal of this project is to develop a new technology for production of large volumes of CZT single crystals with a high yield of detector-grade CZT crystals.  In Phase I we demonstrated the viability of this technology and produced a CZT detector with a lifetime-mobility product value of 10-2cm2/V. The Phase II effort will focus on growth of large diameter crystals of high compositional uniformity, and on engineering of native point defects and second phase precipitates to produce high resistivity, high lifetime-mobility product, and high resolution detectors.  The unique capabilities of the growth process under development will be leveraged to achieve these goals.  The success of this program promises to result in higher availability and lower cost of large volume detectors needed for homeland security and medical applications.Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: Wide band gap semiconductors such as CdZnte are exceptionally suitable for detection of nuclear radiation.

In aggregate these computer systems already consume enormous power, and their energy requirements are increasing both in absolute terms and in proportion to the total capacity of the United States electrical grid. With higher power consumption has come greater difficulty in keeping these systems cool and running reliably, which threatens to curtail the significant benefits to society they provide. We have developed a novel computer processing system based on certain aspects of human brain computation.  The novel system runs embarrassingly parallel software written for standard computer clusters, but provides much higher performance for the same amount of power or, alternatively, consumes much lower power for the same performance. The work conducted in Phase I developed both the hardware implementation and the programming tools to better test the performance and performance-per-watt of the system at standard tasks. Benchmarks in six categories were run and demonstrated that the processor is able to achieve power efficiency improvements ranging from ~10x to ~160x (1000% - 16000%), averaging about 80x. Testing was conducted in Field Programmable Gate Array hardware and cycle-accurate simulation. The Phase II project further develops the programming and simulation tools to allow new users to test their software on the novel system prior to its manufacturing in Phase III.  92 benchmarks have been selected by potential Phase III financers and will be run to provide product performance information helpful for arriving at a procurement decision or other Phase III financing decision. Many benefits to society are anticipated after concluding Phase III.  For example, pharmaceutical companies are anticipated to be able to leverage larger scale supercomputers to pre-test more candidate medicines and eliminate drug testing dead- ends with more accuracy, resulting in an increased probability  that cures for diseases will be found.  In the case of an outbreak of a new infectious disease, the ability to find cures more rapidly increases the likelihood a cure will be found before the disease becomes a global epidemic.",

        "abstract": "As commercial wind turbine technology has matured, designers have steadily increased turbine and tower sizes in an effort to drive down the cost of energy.  Today, that effort has stalled because wind system components are limited by the sizes allowed by transportation. Industry-dominant tubular steel towers have grown so large that their designs are more heavily influenced by delivery and installation concerns than by operational performance.  Alternative tower designs - such as cast-in-place concrete or on-site assembled lattices or panels- have been explored, but these are not cost effective compared to existing systems. Keystone eliminates this problem by bringing fabrication to the wind site using spiral welding.  Spiral welding is a continuous rolling and welding process that has been used in the pipe and piling industries for more than 50 years.  Because it is highly automated and incorporates the entire pipe creation process into a single machine, on-site spiral welding is practical and cost-effective. Keystones innovation adapts this process to the manufacture of wind turbine towers by enabling tapered shapes and variable wall thickness, both requirements for towers. With our system, towers can be manufactured on-site, eliminating transportation barriers and enabling tall, low-cost towers for the wind industry. Keystones process improves the economics of wind energy by both reducing the cost of towers and enabling the wind turbine to reach higher hub heights. Transportation costs are reduced by a factor of ten by eliminating the need for specialized shipping. Larger tower diameters lead to greater structural efficiency, reducing steel usage by 30% for a 120m tower.  Hub heights can also be increased by &amp; gt;50%,- increasing wind speed and energy capture by 8-15%-when compared with the 80m towers currently dominating the industry. The added energy capture for these tall towers, along with manufacturing cost reductions, reduces the cost of energy by 5-7% or more. Keystone has worked with experts from the wind and spiral welding industries to prove the commercial and technical viability of our system, and plans to build and test a prototype machine to further prove the technology.  During Phase I, we worked with major wind turbine OEMs to develop structural and costing models that confirmed a 50% cost reduction for our technology relative to other 120m towers.  We also produced and tested pipes that verified the structural quality of towers produced through spiral welding. Finally, we developed a preliminary machine design that showed that towers meeting the needs of the wind industry can be produced with only small changes to existing, proven spiral mill designs. Phase II will allow us to produce a prototype machine that demonstrates the full automated tapered spiral welding process.  It will be used to produce towers for destructive testing, proving the structural performance of spiral welded towers.  A residential scale wind turbine will also be erected as a demonstration of the technology.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  These milestones will prove out the Keystone process, enabling us to attract support from investors and wind turbine manufacturers for the next development phase: construction of a full-scale mobile pilot plant.",

        "abstract": "There are numerous applications where radio-frequency   (RFID)   tags   can   play   a crucial   role   in national   security   and broader applications, including the safeguarding of nuclear materials to prevent proliferation.   While some of the key technical challenges (such as performance of tags on metal, communication in harsh environments, radiation hardening, long-range passive RF tags, etc.) have been recently addressed and there have been key innovations at the DOE/NNSA National Laboratories and other commercial entities, important security needs to be incorporated onto these sensors in order   to develop secure and reliable end-to-end monitoring systems that meet the strict and peculiar requirements of the DOE/NNSA Safeguards Programs.  The overall objective of the proposed work is to develop end-to-end RF tagging/sensor systems that meet ALL important technical requirements of RF tags for safeguard applications.  There are two major types of technical requirements for safeguard applications: (1) the environmental requirements, such as tags that are functional on metals; and (2) the security requirements, such as tags that communicate via data authentication. A RFID software simulator was developed and exercised for examination of parameters of interest, including tag-reader range, power levels, and authentication delay impacts.  Authentication software and hardware were developed and successfully integrated into a national laboratorys existing UHF RFID tags for safeguarding nuclear materials.   The R &amp; amp;D prototype was successfully fielded and demonstrated to the IAEA in Austria with the national laboratory partner. The R &amp; amp;D prototype will be significantly improved into a commercial RFID prototype with strong authentication and encryption.   Broader tag performance issues will be improved, including tamper-proofing, enhanced range, packaging, and robustness for user applications.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: The primary payoff of this project, if funded through Phase II and beyond, is the development of improved secure RFID tags for deployment in applications involving the securing of special materials.   Besides Safeguards programs in nonproliferation, the use of RF tags in tracking personnel and assets is of interest to DOE, DOD, DHS, and DOT programs.   Multiple programs from various government agencies are expected to become users of the product of this project.  In addition, the secure use of RFIDs for high-value items (e.g. jewelry, materials, pets, etc.) is a problem of significant interest in the commercial world and these will be pursued.",

        "abstract": "Multiphase bubbly mixture flows are of importance in turbomachinery, pipelines, cooling systems, reaction towers, as well as in various applications in petroleum, chemical, geothermal, and nuclear industries. The presence of the gaseous component has a strong influence on performance and efficiency. The ability to predict the flow behavior accurately is essential in designing energy efficient two-phase flow process equipment. A major difficulty in modeling and simulation of such flows lies in the complex multiple lengths and multiple time scale nature of such flows. Conventional scientific and engineering approaches concentrate on either macroscopic averaged quantities or focus on two- phase interface tracking of identified important flow details and do not address the full flow. Therefore, a comprehensive model, which could resolve simultaneously the important scales, is required. The proposed research will develop a multi-scale two-phase flow simulation method capable of accurately representing bubbly flows at the various scales. The model will include a continuum- based phase averaged model for the macro-scales and a discrete bubble/particle model for the micro-scales. These will be integrated into a single code that automatically switches between the two models at different times or in different locations of the studied geometry and allows conversion of discrete bubbles into a continuum description or a liquid-gas free surface, and vice versa, depending on bubble and cavities evolution and space concentration. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  A multi-scale approach based on state-of-the-art numerical techniques will result in a commercial code for generalized bubble flow simulations which can accurately capture important characteristics of cavitating and high void fraction multiphase flows. This software will be able to describe dilute mixtures as well as mixtures that result in large cavities, bubble clouds, separated flows, etc.  This software will enable researchers in chemical, oil and gas, nuclear, and marine industries to conduct design studies and to improve energy efficiency of their processes and devices.

To  convert  the  direct  voltage  measurements  from  the  inductive  pickup  loop  to  a measurement of magnetic field, the loop voltage must be integrated.  In practice several factors make the integration difficult, especially for long-pulse applications when there are many orders of magnitude difference between the fast and slow magnetic signals.   Support and development of the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) program is one of the prime goals for the U.S. fusion program.  To date there is not an integrator solution that can meet the demanding ITER specifications. To  address  this  problem,  Eagle  Harbor  Technologies  proposes  to  transfer  and  upgrade  integrators developed  at  the  University  of  Washington  Redmond  Plasma  Physics Laboratory with prior DOE funding.  These integrators have a demonstrated utility within the Innovative Confinement Community (ICC) community for having high gain and frequency ultra-stable operation.  The proposed work seeks to modify the existing design to provide an ultra-stable integrator system for long-pulse ITER and burning plasma applications and to incorporate the system into a low-cost form factor that will be compatible with several off-the-shelf data acquisition systems. Two versions of the new integrator were designed, built, and tested in the Phase I program. Testing demonstrated exceptional performance capability of the integrators, which significantly outperformed all other known integrators. The new EHT hybrid integrator is the only system that has demonstrated performance suitable to meet the ITER specifications. The Phase II work plan consists of upgrading and building a final integrator prototype, which will be tested at two experimental facilities (DIII-D and HIT-SI) to validate performance.   EHT will partner with National Instruments, a known and established data acquisition hardware manufacturer, to design a final product, ready for commercialization at the completion of the project. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  The direct application is for economical fusion energy development.  However, integrators are used in high energy physics experiments, medical imaging instrumentation and ion beams implantation.  The new EHT hybrid integrator could provide benefit in those areas.",

        "abstract": "The variation between peak and off-peak electricity demand fluctuates up to 70 percent over the course of a 24 hour cycle. This degree of variability is a driver for costly inefficiencies within the power gridto prevent blackouts and meet customer demandas well as power sell offs to consume excess generation available during off-peak hours. Projections estimate the power demand to double by 2050 resulting in an estimated 1.5 trillion dollars in infrastructural updates. Projected growth in the scale of energy consumption mandates a more efficient solution to meet peak demand and consume excess generation capacity during non-peak cycles. The solution incorporates a systematic software system for managing voltage and demand in real-time while adjusting the necessary devices on the network to manage and accommodate the actual current load on the grid.  The collective goal of the DCEDMS project is to provide a state- based control system that will monitor and manage devices within the distribution network for optimal efficiency and responsiveness.  This solution is the only software that addresses the supply side (generation) as well as demand side (consumption) in a unified decision model. The software was tested with 1,200 water heaters and 73 capacitors in an existing network, and the software demonstrates the capacity to monitor voltage readings throughout the network in real-time while independently monitoring and controlling water heaters and capacitors. Phase I testing was extremely successful, and Bristol Tennessee Essential Services is realizing over $1.75 million in annual savings as the result of the DCEDMS. Energy savings derived from the capacitor control program averages 9.3 MW per day. The Carina water heater component (1,200 water heaters) shifts an average 2.75 MW per day from peak to off-peak times. Phase II objectives focus on developing a solution that is scalable, secure and sustainable. Critical milestones of the Phase II research effort include completing the solution implementation at BTES, packaging the DCEDMS for distribution to a second customer and developing additional device capacity to enhance the scalable impact of the system. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  DCEDMS shifts load to off-peak hours and minimizes loss over transmission thereby reducing the requirements for additional generation capacity. These factors result in reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and increased stability of the current grid infrastructure. DCEDMS is the ideal controller for managing the sustainable smart grid solution.",

        "abstract": "Short electron beam pulses (subpicosecond) are central to many of the next generation light source initiatives, like X-Ray Free Electron Lasers. These FELs are based on linear accelerators which produce at the output of the last compressor an electron beam with a residual chirp to compensate for wakefield effects through the rest of the accelerating stage. It is required that this small but significant energy spread be compensated using a specially designed device. We propose to use a dielectric layered waveguide with an adjustable aperture (~2 mm) to be installed, for example, at the output of the last compressor, or at the end of the linac. This short device (~20cm) would allow  the  compensation  of  the  remaining  energy  spread  (~5  MeV  chirp)  after  longitudinal  bunch compression, using its self-wakefield-- Cherenkov radiation generated by the bunch passing through the dielectric loaded waveguide. In Phase I of this proposal Euclid Techlabs demonstrated energy chirp compensation by means of a quartz- loaded 0.95 THz cylindrical waveguide: the 200 keV correlated energy spread of a 60 MeV beam at the BNL Accelerator Test Facility (ATF) was reduced by a factor of three to the spectrometer resolution limit. The energy modulation of a long chirped bunch was demonstrated. A paper based on these results was accepted by Physical Review Letters. We have also developed tools to simulate how the beam energy is affected by its self-wake. This code was benchmarked against experimental results at the ATF. Finally, a tunable energy chirp correction structure was developed for further testing in Phase II. In Phase II we will build and test an optimized energy chirp compensating structure using the ATF beam. We have also designed a quartz structure for energy chirp compensation of the FACET (SLAC) beam which will be available for experiments in 2013  2014.The experience and knowledge gained in Phase I will help further optimization of the experimental design and ensure the success of the project. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: The techniques we propose in this project can reduce the energy chirp of an electron beam produced with existing technologies to make it suitable to drive the next generation of X-Ray FELs. Ultrashort x-ray pulses are a powerful tool for addressing grand challenges in science, e.g. control of materials and processes at the level of electrons, design and perfect atomic- and energy-efficient synthesis of new forms of matter with tailored properties, understanding of the remarkable properties of the matter emerging from complex correlations of atomic and electronic constituents, etc.",

        "abstract": "One of the most attractive features of dielectric based accelerators are their potential capability of operating at ultra-high gradients, which is highly desirable for future high energy collider designs, as well as for industrial and medical accelerator applications. This prediction of ultra-high gradients is widely accepted but has never been verified because of experimental difficulties. We propose to develop an X-band standing wave DLA structure to allow high gradient ( &amp; gt; 100 MV/m) tests with a usage of &amp; lt;10 MW input rf power. The new design couples the rf on the axis of the structure with a matching cell capable of post fabrication tuning.  The new design also allow use of a standard SLAC type X-band TM01 mode launcher as an rf feed, which will eliminate any uncertainty in terms of rf breakdown in the coupler below 20 MW. This new design will provide a good opportunity to achieve the goal of verifying high field breakdown limits in dielectric structures. Under Phase I of the project, we have not only successfully completed all objectives listed in the Phase I proposal but also performed a portion of a task originally allotted to Phase II. We developed a SW DLA structure and performed a high power rf test during the period of Phase I. Two issues arose in the Phase I high power rf test: detuning by multipactor and arcing at the copper end plug. The experimental results were thoroughly analyzed. A simple circuit model is introduced to represent the multipactor effect in a SW DLA structure and good agreement is reached with the experimental data. Meanwhile, in order to address these two issues and achieve the ultimate goal of the project ( &amp; gt;100 MV/m gradient), we have modified the engineering design of the structure and experimental plan for Phase II. A new SW DLA structure will be fabricated in Phase II of the project with solutions to the issues found in Phase I incorporated. Two more high power rf tests will be performed at NRL in Phase II to achieve the ultimate goal of the project.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: This rf breakdown study using a standing wave DLA structure will very likely lead to the observation of gradients as high as 170 MV/m or the first direct measurements of rf breakdown limits in dielectric based accelerators. This project will also provide useful experimental data for the global effort to understand the rf breakdown mechanism in general and may lead to the design of a future collider based on dielectric device technology.",

        "abstract": "Production of highly charged ions, in particular isotope ion beams, is a major effort worldwide, and in particular, in the Department of Energy, Office of Nuclear Physics Department. Rare isotope ion beams, with extreme proton-to-neutron ratios, provides insight into the synthesis of new elements and the discovery of rare nuclei. Charge-breeders based on Electron-Beam-Ion-Sources (EBIS) are a promising method to supply ions with high quality high-charge ion beams. Due to limited simulation tools interpretation of data and optimization of design are extremely limited. FAR-TECH proposes to develop an integrated simulation tool for electron-beam based ion-sources, through physics-based modeling and sophisticated state-of-art computational algorithms. The tool will be modularized for each physical process in an EBIS; steady state electron beam, ion trapping by Monte Carlo Collision, and charge breeding by particle-in-cell for self-consistent space-charge calculations. The tool utilizes multiple processors and optimized grids for efficient computation and to accurately handle multi- scale problems.A prototype of the simulation was developed and tested. Simulations of electron beam, ion injection and charge breeding were performed. Comparisons with experiments showed that the simulation is able to predict, within the limits of experimental uncertainty, the efficiency of different methods of ion injection and trapping. The prototype developed in Phase I will be developed into a full-fledged numerical tool. Additional physics will be incorporated to replace approximate models currently used. Numerical algorithms will be improved to increase the speed at which the simulations run. Simulation results will be validated against measurements on EBIS devices. Finally, the modules will have easy-to-use graphical-user-interface with comprehensive diagnostics (post-processor) aided by visualization. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: A modularized simulation tool for electron-beam based ion-sources will guide and interpret current EBIS experiments; further assist design of new EBIS based charge breeders. The numerical tool can be applied to various ion-source modeling and of science such as accelerators and plasma related problems.",

The ability to rapidly tune the frequency of the accelerating cavity in devices represents a fundamental barrier to their implementation in a wide variety of applications for proton, ion and muon acceleration. An innovative rf cavity design that allows for rapid tuning of the rf cavity frequency over a wide range is being developed. This cavity will be designed using computer modeling, developed though cold testing, prototyping and testing. In Phase I the basic design concept was optimized to reduce power and heating of the tuning element leading to a new design concept. Cold testing verified the performance of the ceramic material use for tuning. Issues of mode conversion and variable tune timing were studied. In Phase II the rapidly tunable rf cavity prototype will be manufactured and tested. Testing requires the construction of an rf amplifier and a ramped high-voltage biasing scheme. Lower power testing to verify the design concept will be performed prior to full cavity production.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: Fast cycling accelerators have a potential for wide use in proton, ion, electron and muon acceleration for basic research, industrial and medical applications. The small size and the ability to accelerate large particle intensities are attractive for proton drivers, light ion accelerators, electron based synchrotron light sources, accelerator driven subcritical nuclear reactors, and cancer therapy machines.

        "abstract": "The development of high-current, short-duration pulses of electrons has been a challenging problem for many years. High current pulses are widely used in injector systems for electron accelerators, both for industrial linacs as well as high-energy accelerators for linear colliders. Short-duration pulses are also used for microwave generation in klystrons and related devices, for injectors to perform research on advanced methods of particle acceleration, and for injectors used as free-electron-laser (FEL) drivers. The proposed method to be described below is promising because of a natural bunching process which self-synchronizes to the rf, thus eliminating the need for pre-buncher section(s), timing system, and lasers. Also, the repetition rate can be orders of magnitude greater. FM  Technologies  proposes  a  novel  high  current,  picosecond  X-band  bunched  electron  gun system which is named the X-band Bunched Electron Injector (XBEI). The heart of the XBEI is a self-bunching electron gun, the X-Band Micro-Pulse Gun (XMPG). By adding an external electron amplifier stage and high energy RF or pulsed voltage post acceleration, an inexpensive, simple, robust electron injector or klystron self-bunching electron gun would result. In Phase I, electron amplification with diamond in the XMPA has been demonstrated, and measurements of electron current gain, charge per bunch, rf power, beam power and other key parameters have been performed. Phase II will be aimed at design, fabrication, and testing of an XBEI to 5-6 MeV and a new type of klystron.  This  includes  development  of  the  electron  amplifier  for  the  XMPG  and  rf acceleration and a klystron output cavity. The experiments will be to establish the baseline for characterizing the XBEI device for suitability for a variety of potential applications. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  If successful, this micro-pulse electron amplifier injector (XBEI) will provide a high power, low admittance, picosecond-long electron source which is suitable for many applications. Of particular interest are high energy picosecond electron injectors for linear colliders, free electron lasers, medical and industrial rf linacs, a high-frequency driver for rf sources",

Yet solid-state materials and gases interact in many important ways. The most critical technological application for these observations is catalysis, where one would like to directly observe on the atomic scale how catalysts respond to the environment while they are active. Several areas of research, such as catalysis and sensors, will greatly benefit from having access to such observations. The importance of catalytic studies for science and technology was highlighted by two Nobel Prizes in chemistry for catalytic studies (Ertl, 2007 and Suzuki, Heck, Nigishi, 2010) awarded in the past five years. This Phase II proposal focuses on developing and bringing to market a TEM specimen holder where the specimen is exposed to various gas atmospheres with a wide range of pressures at different temperatures with full operando quantitative measuring capabilities.  Such a device would enable in-situ TEM studies of catalysts and sensors, among many other materials of interest. In Phase I of the work we have successfully created a working prototype of the in-situ TEM gas holder and supporting hardware.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  This product will be aimed at researchers using electron microscopy for characterizing the internal structure of materials at the nanometer to sub-Angstrom lengths scales and who are interested in dynamic in-situ experiments. These experiments are finding increasing use as direct methods to explore the relationships among materials processing methods and microstructure and functional properties (e.g. catalytic and sensing). The commercial availability of a variable temperature gas TEM holder will facilitate and accelerate academic research in the field of gas catalysis. It will also provide a platform to study active elements of sensors during operation with relevant resolution (atomic length scale).",

For the windings of such undulators the solicitation also requests the use of new superconducting materials such as improved Nb3Sn superconductors and high temperature superconductor such as YBCO tape, and the development of appropriate coil manufacturing techniques. Hyper Tech addresses these needs with its new Tube Type Nb3Sn superconductor and undulator coil fabrication techniques. Hyper Techs Nb3Sn Tube Type strands are high Jc, small deff strands thus they are stable at low fields. These strands have the potential to enable much improved superconducting undulators. In Phase I, we successfully modeled, designed and wound, using state-of-the-art tube-type Nb3Sn wire, a short demonstration undulator in the form of a planar coil set, and measured its electromagnetic properties at 4.2 K. The maximum on-axis magnetic field achieved was 2.3 T which reached the targeted modeled wire and coil performance. In this Phase II, we will continue to improve the wire properties and optimize the design of multi-pole planar undulator coil set, and make the multi-pole planar coil set. We will improve our wire for higher field undulator coils. We will continue to make extensive use of both electromagnetic and thermal FE modeling for optimizing the coil designs.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  For undulators and wiggler magnets in accelerators, the Nb3Sn strands have relatively high Tc (thermal margin), hence radiation tolerance, and its use will lead to the development of more potent synchrotron light sources. As radiation sources, these machines find use in research, medicine, and industry. According to a U.S. EPA article, more than 97% of the 15,000 accelerators in use around the world have commercial applications, e.g. in diagnosing and treating cancer, locating oil and minerals in the  earth, processing semiconductor chips for  computers, determining the  age of  materials through radiocarbon dating and sterilizing medical equipment and food products.",

One possible approach is to develop aerogel-based additive for existing insulation products and rendering them capable of offering 30% or better thermal barrier performance enhancement. The increased cost of the newer breed of insulation can be easily offset by energy savings and related tax rebates. InnoSense LLC (ISL) is developing aerogel-based insulation (InsuGel) that will efficiently insulate pipes and ducts  traditional sources of energy loss. InsuGel will consist of foam that will be sprayed onto surfaces and formed in situ. ISLs aerogel additive will improve the insulation properties of the foam while the in situ forming aspects will ensure complete substrate coverage and improve crevice filling. We demonstrated the feasibility of improving thermal characteristics of conventional polyurethane foam insulation by introducing aerogel particles. Two systems were studied in Phase I, including two-part blowable polyurethane foam and loose fill cellulose. Aerogel particles were incorporated into the structure through mixing methods. The end product was a moldable structure showing an improvement in R-value up to 30%. In Phase II, we will optimize InsuGel to improve morphology and develop scale-up methodologies. We will investigate particle size, concentration, storage, mixing, and insulation application. The scale-up approach would be validated by an industrial laboratory. The thermal performance characteristics, including the R-value increase desired by DOE, would be validated by a DOE lab and a commercial testing facility following ASTM methods. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: Current housing insulation is limited by existing materials such as fiberglass batting, polyurethane foam, and cellulose loose fill. ISL will enhance these materials by adding small amounts of aerogel-based additives to insulation materials. InsuGel will offer improved thermal characteristics, be easily used to retrofit existing structures, and effectively insulate hard-to- reach joints and ducts.",

The short-pulse and short- wavelength nature of this source enables capturing ultrafast dynamics in materials and nano-devices, and the wide range of tunability makes it applicable to a broad range of materials and nano-devices. This source can potentially impact the research and development in the fields of nanotechnology, new energy resources, and biomedical science. How this problem being addressed: We develop this beamline using a high harmonic generation source, which generates coherent, short-pulse, broadband, extreme ultraviolet and soft X-ray light through nonlinear up-conversion. The short pulse, tunable and monochromatic beamline is then realized by using a Monk-Gillieson monochromator with a grating operating at off-plane mount and in grazing incidence geometry. In Phase I, we have explored the feasibility of the beamline design in the following two aspects: 1. How to produce efficient broadband extreme ultraviolet and soft X-ray generation using high harmonic generation; 2. looking for optimum grating parameters and mounting geometry, as well as monochromator design to obtain high spectral resolution and short pulse duration. The results have demonstrated the feasibility, and helped to obtain the design parameters for the beamline. In Phase II, we will, first, turn this beamline design into a research prototype. Second, we will develop a diagnostics system that can measure the flux, stability, pulse duration and beam quality of the beamline for routine operation. Finally, we will test and optimize the performance, as well as lower the costs and improve the ease-of-use of the beamline. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: A tabletop, tunable, short-pulse soft x-ray source that is optimized for elemental- and chemical-specific spectroscopy, microscopy and nano-imaging will enable discoveries and technological advances spanning a broad range of science and technology. In the short term, the proposed tunable, ultrafast, soft x-ray source can be combined with techniques such as angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) to understand novel correlated electron materials, high-Tc superconductors, photovoltaic devices, catalytic processes, nanoscale magnetic dynamics, nanoscale heat and charge transport, thin film metrologies, and hydrogen storage, as well as uncovering new science in the area of molecular dynamics and the function of biological systems. In the longer term, the proposed beamline will make it possible to capture a 3-D, high resolution x-ray image of a nanodevice or a single cell with elemental- and chemical-specificity. All these findings will lead to faster and more energy-efficient electronics, new energy resources and new ways to treat diseases.",

The ClimatePipes cyberinfrastructure will provide state-of-the-art, user-friendly access, analysis, and visualization of data generated from high-resolution, long-term, climate change projections performed as part of the U.S. Global Change Research Program, the DOE-funded ESGF, NSF-funded DataONE, and NASA-funded EOSDIS. ClimatePipes is not a replacement for high-end tools for scientists, but instead provides simple, intuitive, and effective workflows that can be used by non-researchers and non-programmers. It builds on top of existing high-end tools, and is designed to easily leverage functionality added to those tools, thus ensuring state-of-the-art functionality in the years to come. ClimatePipes was successfully developed as a web-based tool that provides workflow and form-based interfaces for accessing, querying, and visualizing interesting datasets from one or more sources. This was integrated with ESGF and tools from UV-CDAT for the purpose of data manipulation and visualization. ClimatePipes demonstrated production of relevant data and visualizations in response to natural language queries. Will focus on implementation of mechanisms for supporting more elaborate and relevant queries, and improvements to the usability, robustness and scalability of the system. In order to support these types of queries, the team will develop a semantic search tool using natural language processing techniques. The team will also add the capability to perform appropriate transformations to bring relevant data into a common reference system. Upon completion of Phase II, ClimatePipes will provide an interface for running computations in the cloud or on a user-provided cluster, to accommodate the compute power required. Further, the team will develop custom visualizations for climate applications, an API, and an appropriate user interface for uploading data to the server for analyses and integration.",

        "abstract": "Validation and verification (V &amp; amp;V) is an essential part of any large scientific computing effort and of the computational physics component of the international fusion program in particular. To assist in this task, we propose the creation of a flexible eigenvalue solver that can be adapted to fluid and kinetic plasma physics models in a variety of magnetic geometries.  This lightweight code can be used (i) to benchmark more complicated nonlinear time-stepping codes by comparing linear growth rates of dominant instabilities, and (ii) as a convenient stand-alone code for linear physics studies for a wide range of problems. In the Phase I project, an eigenvalue solver for partial differential equations with a high degree of flexibility was created.  This code has the distinctive feature that equation sets, differential operators, topology, and dimensionality are all determined by input files rather than being fixed by the source code. These features were demonstrated in a number of test cases, showing its capacity to solve simple fluid and kinetic problems in a variety of geometries.  In the Phase II project, we plan to expand these capabilities to include richer topological capabilities including unstructured grids, parallel computing capability for large kinetic problems, and source-driven matrix solve capability for perturbed equilibrium problems.  We also plan to create utilities to make the entire package easier and more intuitive to use, and to continue verification and benchmarking exercises so as to establish a high degree of confidence in this code prior to its intended use in benchmarking full nonlinear simulation codes. Given its value of such a code to the fusion community, it is anticipated that this code will generate follow-on funding in the form of research grants to maintain the code, as well as subcontracts to apply it to V &amp; amp;V and application driven efforts pertaining to specific simulation codes.",

Researchers use stable isotope data to study: 1) recycling of CO2 within forests; 2) water use efficiency; 3) partitioning carbon exchange into its components; and 4) identify and quantify the distribution and contributions of C3 and C4 species to global productivity. Los Gatos Research proposes to develop a rugged, field-deployable, Off-Axis Integrated Cavity Output Spectroscopy (Off-Axis ICOS) instrument for eddy flux and chamber flux measurements of CO2 concentration and isotope ratios (13C, 18O, and 17O) in ambient air. LGR demonstrated technical feasibility by fabricating an Off-Axis ICOS instrument that measured CO2 concentration, 13C, 18O, and 17O to better than  0.022 ppm,  0.084 ,  0.093 , and  0.186  respectively (1, 100s) on both   ambient air and syringe-injected samples.   Moreover, the instrument provided a measurement rate of 9.1 Hz for eddy correlation flux measurements.  The [CO2] and 13C accuracy of analyzer was better than  0.30 ppm and  0.16  respectively over a wide dynamic range of CO2 concentrations (271 - 2961 ppm).  The instrument was interfaced to a soil-gas sampler to record the isotope flux from soils.  LGR then worked with Professor Dennis Baldocchi (UC Berkeley) to deploy the instrument at a DOE Amerflux site in Sherman Island, California.  Finally, the Phase I instrument was also used to provide mobile monitoring data for the development of Isoscapes. In Phase II, LGR will refine the instrument to increase its accuracy, precision, dynamic range, and stability.  A calibration scheme will help optimize precision and minimize concentration dependences. The instrument will be interfaced to other analyzers and a gas injection system.  The analyzer will be tested at LGR before delivery to Professor Ralph Keeling (Scripps) for independent verification on calibrated samples and ambient air.   Subsequently, LGR will fabricate additional units and work with Professor Chris Still (UC Santa Barbara) and Professor Dennis Baldocchi (UC Berkeley) to deploy the instruments at an Experiment Forest and to study the carbon  water cycle interactions and the Sherman Island DOE Ameriflux site for long-term monitoring of CO2 isotope fluxes.  Finally, LGR will evaluate using the technology to quantify 14CO2   and 13C18O16O (clumped isotopes).  Additionally, LGR is providing a Phase II Funding Commitment to interface a combustion front-end unit to the analyzer. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  The proposed SBIR analyzer has significant commercial potential for environmental research, medical diagnostics, and other isotope applications (e.g. mining, food verification)",

Lygos is developing microbial hosts for the cost-competitive production of dicarboxylic acids from renewable feedstocks, including cellulosic hydrolysate.   The combined Phase I/II approach is the development and use of a high-throughput dicarboxylic acid screen to assay for improved dicarboxylic acid production from engineered microbes. In Phase I, we constructed and characterized three dicarboxylic acid screens applicable for short- to medium-chain microbially produced diacids (up to C7). The screens are based on microbial sensing of exogenous dicarboxylic acid and an associated increase in a colorimetric reporter output. The dicarboxylic acid screen will now be implemented as a high-throughput assay for improved dicarboxylic acid production in engineered microbes. Combinatorial libraries of engineered proteins and metabolic pathways will be tested for improvements in strain yield, titer, and productivity. Dicarboxylic acid production in the evolved strain will be also demonstrated using a cellulosic hydrolysate sugar source. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: Dicarboxylic acids are high-value chemicals used in the manufacturing of commodity and specialty goods.

In addition to physical measurements (e.g., pressure, temperature), real-time knowledge of gas compositions at critical locations enables optimizing operational conditions. The goal of this project is to develop an integrated package to enable operation of MEMS sensors in the harsh environments associated with advanced power systems. This standard package will enable placement of a variety of chemical sensors in the process, and to quickly adjust for process variations (e.g. feedstock energy content, intake air humidity, etc.). In Phase I, Makel Engineering developed two integral probe designs for harsh environments, meeting the requirements for a wide range of applications within advanced power generation. The T-Style integral packaging was developed for installation in stationary turbines.   The R- Style was developed for installation in refractory lined walls.  Probes were fabricated and tested in simulated environments. Phase II will focus on testing chemical sensors in turbine and gasifier systems at a wide range of end user facilities that include DOE coal-fired facilities as well as facilities operated by Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD) and turbine manufactures.  This will demonstrate how advanced sensors can play an important role in characterizing the physical and chemical environments within gas turbines and other components present in emerging clean coal technology power systems. Advanced stationary gas turbines is the primary application for the technology, requiring. Measurement of species such as NOx, CO and O2 at elevated temperatures to optimize operational conditions.

The large capital costs attributed to the cathode low performance and long-term stability issues are a current limitation of SOFC technologies that must be addressed before commercial SOFC power generation can be realized. The typical SOFC composite cathode possesses excellent performance characteristics but is subject to chemical stability issues during manufacturing and power generation operation at elevated temperatures. The proposed work aims to develop a vacuum-assisted infiltration technique to improve SOFC cathode performance and longevity through the impregnation of an inexpensive electrocatalyst precursor(s) into a cathode backbone. The vacuum-assisted infiltration apparatus and the infiltration protocol were developed and validated on both button cells and short stacks having 100 cm2 per-cell active areas. Catalyst distribution and morphology were investigated via the advanced X-ray diffraction and radiographic techniques. Phase II efforts will be built-on the results of Phase I and improve the vacuum-assisted infiltration process and protocol. Proof-of-concept demonstration of the SOFC cathode performance improvement will be performed on a bench scale kW-class stack.

        "abstract": "For many years, electrically driven heat pumps have proven to be an effective method of extracting heat from ambient air. As air temperature falls, however, heat pump performance falls off, essentially limiting their year round usefulness to warmer climates. In colder climates heat pump-equipped heating systems typically have a secondary means to provide heat, usually natural gas or electricity.  This adds complexity, duplication, cost and pollution.  There are currently no strong candidates for air source heat pump system designs that maintain both capacity and coefficient of performance (COP) in cold climates. If these systems were developed, they could have a significant energy-savings impact in cold regions, particularly where natural gas is not available. To address this opportunity, Mechanical Solutions, Inc. (MSI) proposes to develop a compact, motor driven refrigerant compressor that can be installed in the low pressure portion of the refrigerant loop to boost the refrigerant pressure ahead of the heat pumps existing compressor.  The MSI device will be compact, highly efficient, and suitable for back-fit as well as new installations and future new products.  Properly configured, the MSI supercharger will be universally applicable to the entire heat pump market, and will enable heat pumps to be applied to far colder climates without changing the type of refrigerant employed or the design of commercial compressors used in todays marketplace.Commercial Application and Other Benefits:  MSIs proposed effort directly supports benefits at both the commercial and federal level: Effective use of heat pumps at colder temperatures will enable less use of foreign oil for heating; MSIs device will be a leading-edge combination of advanced technologies in small process-driven turbocompressors, and oil-free, low-cost bearings; As sources of electric power become cleaner, wider heat pump use offers the ability to produce heat with minimal increase in greenhouse gases.  Customer sites include countless commercial installations throughout the country.  Residential building candidates are numerous. Overcoming the technical challenges in the work MSI proposes is within our grasp.  Developing this device will place the U.S. ahead of foreign competitors, and leading edge domestic-based science and technology will be the result.",

        "abstract": "Nationwide about 2.4 billion gallons of lubricants are consumed annually for automotive crankcase (about 58%), industrial processes, machine lubrication, mining, and others.  About 1 billion gallons/yr is currently collected as waste oil, equivalent to1-1.5% of annual US crude oil import volume.  Presently, about 9% of the collected used oil is re-refined at six facilities in US. The majority of this resource is currently burned as fuel.  A report issued by the DOE in 2006 in response to The Energy Policy Act of 2005 Section 1838 highlights that the major impediment to expanding lube oil re-refining is investment costs required to design and construct new facilities for re-refining.  According to the literature, about $40million in front end capital investment is required for a 30 million gallon per year (MGY) re-refining facility. This explains why the capital investment cost is listed as the primary impediment for expanding current re-refining capacity. Media and Process Technology Inc has been involved in the re-refining of waste oil using an innovative separation process which does not involve phase separation and hydrotreating as in the conventional technology.  Thus, the re-refining facility can be designed and constructed in a small scale and modular operation without paying an economy of scale penalty.  This not only reduces the front end capital investment per facility, but makes it uniquely suitable for regional re-refining operations to match waste oil supplies, as opposed to the conventional technology requiring a centralized operation to justify its large capital investment. A clean in place (CIP) methodology with our specially formulated cleaner package was developed to restore the flux of our ceramic membranes severely and irreversibly fouled during used oil processing, overcoming a key barrier to the commercial viability of this re-refining process.  In addition, a rapid QA/QC strategy for used oil feedstock characterization and suitability for re-refining was developed. Process was demonstrated at the pilot scale in four months of continuous operation. In addition, the CIP is considered universal for oil filtration applications; several generic energy saving opportunities have been identified, which can benefit from the industrial membrane system equipped with the CIP we developed. We plan to expand our existing re-refining pilot operation to a semi-works facility to demonstrate the performance and economics of our upgraded re-refining process for petroleum-based waste oil. Then, we plan to establish the 1st regional re-refining center with our operational partner to showcase the technology and process and in parallel begin the deployment of the regional centers nationwide. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  Our re-refining technology could positively impact the national energy consumption profile via an economically driven approach, potentially resulting in a 1% reduction in crude oil imports and significant reduction in air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.  Nationwide, waste oil re-refining with this technology is expected to create job opportunities.  Further, the technology is readily exportable.",

We have identified a volatile chemical that is indicative of key steps in uranium isotope enrichment, and can be detected readily at low concentrations using optical methods.  Small plumes that are about 1 m across and containing as little as 20 parts per million (ppm), or less, of the marker will be detectable. The measurement method is based on optical spectroscopy using sunlight as a light source.  As such, our approach is unobtrusive and can be engineered into compact, rugged, low-power devices. The Phase I project identified the critical design issues that will be resolved in Phase II. Benchtop experiments demonstrated the proof-of-concept for passive, remote sensing of the target species.   Limiting noise sources were identified and strategies for mitigating the noise were developed.  The Phase I effort led to development of a low-noise current driver for diode lasers and to signal processing using a novel (patentable) approach for narrow-band detection of large bandwidth signals. A prototype remote sensor will be designed, assembled, and evaluated. The approach will include specialized optical and electronic designs that should overcome the performance limitations identified in Phase I.  A subcontractor (Avo Photonics) will assist with the optical design so that minimal re-engineering will be required for Phase III commercial or military development.Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: Successful development of the proposed technology will address a key national security issue using fully automated remote sensors that can operate unattended for extended periods while looking for a chemical signature of uranium (and possibly, plutonium processing).

Conventional sensors cannot withstand these extremely harsh environments and are rarely selfpowered with the option for wireless interrogation.

MesoScribe Technologies proposes a collaborative effort with KCF Technologies to develop a selfpowered wireless sensor system for monitoring industrial gas turbines.

In this SBIR proposal, Niowave will build and test the quarter-wave cavity design developed in Phase I of the SBIR.  This new cavity system is simpler and less expensive to build and maintain than contemporary cavities used at large light sources. This novel design will allow new compact systems to meet the demand from the user community for high-energy light at high brightness and high duty factor currently only available at large light sources located at national laboratories. The interaction between the electron beam and higher-order modes in the accelerating cavities can lead to beam breakup instabilities that limit the maximum current that the cavities can maintain.   Quarter wave structures have a higher-order mode spectrum which differs greatly from conventional elliptically-shaped cavities.  The Phase I project resulted in a cavity design that is more compact and simplified compared to the industry-leading CESR-B cryomodule. The proposed design will reduce the initial and operating costs to incorporate superconducting RF in a compact light source project, with MeV energy gain at reasonable cavity surface fields. For smaller projects which do not require the voltages available with the large elliptical cavity designs, the simpler and less expensive cavity and module presented here will be immediately attractive.  Furthermore, making this quarter wave SRF cavity design available to the designers of small machines in Phase III of this SBIR can be an important path toward demonstrating the technology and eventually making it relevant for even large machines at national labs.

        "abstract": "To realize laser-driven inertial fusion energy with economically viable efficiency and repetition rates, pumping the laser system with semiconductor diode lasers instead of the flashlamp will be essential. Diode laser prices are currently much too high for practical implementation of fusion energy. Novel technologies need to be pursued to scale up diode laser power while simultaneously reducing the costs, resulting in an order-of-magnitude improvement in costs/Watt. nLight proposes novel bipolar cascade diode laser architecture to address both the power and efficiency requirements, as well as the cost challenge placed upon diode laser technology. Power-scaling of semiconductor diode laser bars will be demonstrated by vertically stacked multiple laser diodes in one epitaxial growth, effectively reducing the cost of manufacturing laser diodes and high-power packaged assemblies. Under the Phase I program, nLight has successfully demonstrated the concept of epitaxially stacking two laser diodes on one substrate, resulting in two-fold increase in power without much sacrifice in efficiency. A maximum output power of 680 W with a peak overall efficiency of 63% was demonstrated for a 1-cm double-junction CS-mounted diode laser bar. Our diode laser models predict that not only can we further improve the efficiency but getting a three-fold increase in power is also feasible. During the proposed Phase II effort, nLight will optimize double-junction diode laser bars for higher efficiency, reproducibility and reliability. nLight will also explore further power scaling through design and development of triple-junction diode laser bars.   Upon conclusion of the proposed program, a 10-bar stacked array with a rated power of 1.3 kW/bar will be fabricated and delivered. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: Global energy demand is rapidly outpacing the world energy supply, and so the benefits that fusion energy could offer to society are obvious. The proposed development of high power, high efficiency and low cost diode lasers is essential in practical implementation of laser-driven inertial fusion energy. The proposed development would also have far-reaching impacts in current commercial applications that nLight is a leader in.  For example, in the defense sector, high power, high efficiency QCW arrays are utilized in systems including rangefinders, target designators, 3D LIDAR imaging/surveillance cameras, illuminators and even as a fuse replacement for artillery ignition.  In the industrial and aerospace sectors,  QCW  laser  arrays  are  commonly used  to  pump solid  state laser  systems.    One potential killer application which resides in the consumer sector is the direct use as a spark plug replacement in large engines which requires high peak power lasers",

        "abstract": "Advanced battery recycling has potential to significantly reduce end-of-life cost for large format batteries. Available technology melts or dissolves batteries to recover cobalt or nickel, destroying advanced materials with potential for manufacturing use. With little elemental value in electric-drive applications, recyclers require substantial fees for decommission, and do not contribute to lowering the life- cycle cost of advanced battery materials. New recycling technology must reduce these costs for advanced batteries to help the industry gain long-term market share. The Phase I &amp; amp; II project demonstrates feasibility of advanced recycling techniques and develops pilot scale processes using commercial grade lithium-ion batteries. The Phase I project demonstrated successful cradle-to- cradle use of advanced battery material.  The feasibility study started with vehicle- grade, large-format lithium-ion cells, faded them to a well-used state, recovered and rejuvenated the material, and built numerous cells to demonstrate utility and feasibility of manufacturing with rejuvenated material. This SBIR Phase II project, Advanced Battery Recycling develops the pilot scale processes for harvest and rejuvenation of materials from end-of-life, mainstream, large-format lithium-ion batteries.  Solid state, soft- chemical methods can revitalize materials to maximize their value independently of the elemental value. As a new, soft-chemically based recycling procedure, Advanced Recycling offers an important innovation to reduce human impact, increase efficiency, and produce low cost battery grade secondary material. The objective of this project is to recycle a high-power lithium-ion battery cathode material and demonstrate (1) scalability of processes and (2) multiple life-time use of rejuvenated material. Starting with spent batteries, the project recovers and refurbishes material, manufactures new batteries, tests and fades those cells and repeats the cradle-to-cradle process.  The anticipated result of this development is establishment of pilot scale processes to rejuvenate high performance battery materials. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: This Phase I &amp; amp; II SBIR project develops the most efficient and environmentally friendly recycling technology as the solution to the next generations significant environmental challenge: advanced materials recycling and manufacturing. The fully developed recycling process will be the basis for jobs fundamental to portable electronics and large format battery markets. The outcome is expected to be a safe and efficient commercial process providing manufacturers of large format batteries with cradle-to-cradle life-cycle services.",

        "abstract": "The emerging field of visual analytics, which integrates analytical reasoning with interactive visualization, appears to be a promising technique for improving the business practices in todays electric power industry. The conducted investigation has revealed that the existing commercial power grid visualization tools  focus  on  displaying  the  data  rather  than  providing  users  an  interactive  ability  to  facilitate information exploration. These tools, typically designed to support a particular type of applications, restrict the information exploration process to follow a limited number of pre-defined visualization patterns created by human designers, thus, hindering the users ability to discover. This project proposes a data-driven approach to interactive visualization of power grids. A data-driven visualization uses empirically or mathematically derived data to dynamically formulate the visualization. The approach relies on developing powerful data manipulation algorithms to create visualizations based on the characteristics of data. It will result in an interactive and user-driven visualization tool that fosters scientific understanding and insight, therefore, unleashing the power of visualization. The proposed data-driven visualization approach, as demonstrated in the preliminary investigation conducted during Phase I, has proven to be promising for building the next-generation power grid visualization tools. Application of this approach has resulted in a state-of-the-art query-driven model exploratory tool currently leveraged by utilities and vendors in the power industry. The proposed Phase II of this project will focus on prototyping an event-driven visualization tool designed to enhance situational awareness in a power grid control room. The goal is to assist system operators to perceptually monitor a large number of events and present the analytical information in a way that reduces cognitive demands on operators. It is expected that the research conducted and the prototype developed during this phase of the project will be carried over to Phase III and eventually result in a commercial tool that will benefit the industry and make the grid operation more secure.",

        "abstract": "The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is actively funding research to significantly enhance the thermal efficiency of coal-fired steam boilers for power generation through the use of advanced ultra-supercritical (A-USC) steam temperatures and pressures. Since coal fired power plants are the dominant source of domestic power generation, the accelerated design, development and commercialization of efficient, reliable, next-generation coal-fired power plants can significantly increase domestic energy security and enhance the U.S. technical leadership strength. The purpose of this SBIR program is to create a new alloy for A-USC coal-fired boilers using QuesTeks computational alloy design methodology and specific experience developing and commercializing a creep-resistant ferritic superalloy with low processing cost related to welding. During the Phase I program, QuesTek Innovations collaborated with engineers from a boiler OEM as well as technical experts from the DOE to identify the elimination of post-weld heat treatment and increase in creep-resistance as two critical material objectives for the new alloys. QuesTek then designed a series of prototype alloys using computational models to target critical design parameters, fabricated prototype samples for high temperature tensile test as well as welding demonstration.  In Phase I, QuesTeks new alloys show superb high temperature tensile strength and robust weld-zone microstructure unseen in incumbent alloys such as P92. Based on the results from the Phase I prototype alloys, and on input from project stakeholders, the objective of Phase II is to execute a detailed alloy design and demonstrate the performance and processing characteristics satisfying the alloy design criteria. Working with one of its suppliers, QuesTek will prototype ingots to specification at intermediate size scale (30 lb. and 1,500 lb. size). Alloy creep strength, weldability, steamside and fireside oxidation resistance will be demonstrated in the intermediate scale materials. Facilities at our OEM collaborators will be employed to simulate the actual power plant service environment. In Phase III our investigations will be expanded (in conjunction with our OEM partners) to include component level testing and qualification. Application of the alloy to additional components with similar requirements will be identified and pursued.",

Historically,  this  has  been  driven  by  the  synchrotron  radiation  users demand  for  higher-brightness   hard  X-ray  fluxes  from  3rd  Generation   Light  Sources.  Recently,  the emergence  of X-ray  FELs and growing  interest  towards  ultrafast  compact  soft X-rays  facilities,  require even  shorter  period  ( &amp; lt; 1 cm)  undulator  structures.  In both  cases,  the  desired  undulator  parameters  are outside of the performance  envelope of the conventional  permanent magnet in-vacuum  undulators, hence new materials and new design approaches are being sought for. This   project   seeks   to   develop   a   novel   high   peak   field,   ultra-short   period   undulator using two unconventional materials: praseodymium iron-boron permanent magnets (PrFeB) and textured dysprosium (Tx Dy) ferromagnetic field concentrators.  Both materials exhibit extraordinary magnetic properties at cryogenic   temperatures, such   as very   large   energy   product   and record   high   induction   saturation, respectively. The undulator planned to be built in Phase II will significantly surpass the state-of-the-art and offer an ideal solution for the next generation of compact X-ray light sources. In the Phase I, we experimentally demonstrated feasibility of using Tx Dy poles in a hybrid undulator configuration with PrFeB magnets, achieving 1.4 T on axis field in a 9 mm period undulator (K ~ 1.2). In the Phase II we plan to optimize the Tx Dy pole production process, and fabricate and characterize a complete flange-to-flange prototype undulator system, with period of 7 mm and a peak field on axis of about 1.5 T. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  Practical realization of the proposed device will significantly surpass state-of-the-art and offer an ideal solution for the next generation of compact X-ray light sources, as well as for some of the most demanding applications at conventional storage ring based synchrotron radiation sources. In addition, the proposed undulator device offers a high added value application for the two new materials, PrFeB and Tx Dy.",

        "abstract": "Recent improvements in synchrotron radiation sources have generated an urgent need for high-performance X-ray detectors.   While new imaging devices have been developed that employ high-performance CCD sensors, what is currently lacking in these detectors is an adequate  X-ray-to-light  converter  that  will  provide  high  performance  in  terms  of  spatial resolution, efficiency and, perhaps most importantly, fast decay of the scintillation light in order to allow the high-speed image acquisition that is necessary for performing dynamic or time- resolved experiments. To address these issues, we propose to develop and manufacture a novel high-speed scintillator, through the band gap engineering of the well-known microcolumnar CsI:Tl screens that are common in advanced X-ray imaging systems.  The enhanced, co-doped CsI:Tl will provide all of the benefits of conventional CsI:Tl, but with a 10- to 100-fold reduction in afterglow and negligible hysteresis.   The microcolumnar form of the co-doped CsI:Tl scintillator will combine high X-ray absorption, high spatial resolution, and negligible afterglow and hysteresis. The  proposed  scintillator  will  enable  the  realization  of  the  high-speed,  large-area,  high- resolution detectors needed for important time-resolved X-ray diffraction and other studies. During the Phase I research, we demonstrated the feasibility of developing a manufacturing method to produce co-doped CsI:Tl films that consistently exhibit both low afterglow and superior spatial resolution ranging from several to tens of microns, depending on thickness.  These films were characterized in detail in terms of both scintillation properties and imaging performance by integrating them into the latest high-performance camera developed by our commercial collaborator and evaluated at the BioCAT beam line at the Advanced Photon Source (Argonne National Laboratory, Chicago). We have also performed imaging experiments at 1000 frames per second that demonstrate the low afterglow and bright emissions of the films. During the proposed Phase II research, we will undertake efforts to successfully optimize the Phase I process in order to produce and market these screens through our own resources and in collaboration with our commercial partners. The goal of the Phase II will be to produce films up to 2020 cm2 in area, with high light output, low afterglow, and high spatial resolution, to advance the performance of next-generation high frame rate detectors. By working closely with our commercial partners during the Phase II, we will establish a clear path to transition the Phase II research into a Phase III customer-oriented product. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  Applications for the enhanced scintillator developed here are many, and range from macromolecular crystallography to medical imaging, and from nondestructive testing to polymer research.

        "abstract": "X-ray microtomography (XMT) is a powerful tool for researchers in a wide range of fields, enabling 3D imaging at the micron scale.  Many of the DOE synchrotron tomography facilities are involved in research that requires hard X-rays (high energy, up to 100 keV) in order to get better penetration into metal samples.  At these higher energies the scintillator quickly becomes the limiting factor, resulting in poor image quality and very long acquisition times.  What is needed is a high-yield scintillator with sufficient stopping power for hard X-rays to allow its fabrication into screens thin enough (and bright enough) to achieve adequate resolution under the relevant measurement conditions. A material that can satisfy all the performance needs for XMT applications already exists. This material, Lu2O3:Eu has the highest density among all known scintillators, very high X-ray absorption, and a bright red emission that matches well to CCD quantum efficiency.  However, its high melting point and low vapor pressure has heretofore prevented its fabrication in the form of microcolumnar films.   When coupled to a CCD or other suitable detector, such structured films will result in a significant improvement in the overall detective quantum efficiency (DQE) of the XMT detector, and will permit the full potential of this invaluable technique to be realized. The Phase I research has now demonstrated the feasibility of producing this new structured scintillator  that  will  enable  the  development  of  XMT  detectors  with  an  unprecedented combination of high resolution and high sensitivity for hard X-ray imaging.  A vapor deposition process, driven by electron beam, was developed, and its capability for generating structured films thick enough (50 m) and with high enough intrinsic resolution (20 lp/mm) for XMT, has been established and quantified.  Tests are under way at Argonne National Laboratory and preliminary results are quite promising. The challenge for Phase II is to develop the new deposition protocol into a full-fledged and viable commercial process.  This means a large number of experiments with experimental parameters systematically varied so as to produce material with optimal characteristics and reproducible performance.  The scintillation and imaging properties will be quantified, and the films will be integrated into prototype detectors that will be evaluated against conventional commercial detectors both in-house (using X-ray sources) and at XMD beam lines at the Argonne synchrotron facility. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: Applications for the enhanced structured scintillator developed here are many, and while the initial focus is on XMT with hard X-rays, this new and cost-effective form of this scintillator could also be used in a broad array of applications ranging from macromolecular crystallography to medical imaging, and from nondestructive testing to polymer research.  Due to the extraordinary properties  of  this  scintillator,  we  expect  it  to  have  widespread  use  in  many  important synchrotron-based applications, and will substantially improve modeling of oil-field extraction potential and CO2 sequestration.

        "abstract": "In an increasingly hostile computing environment, Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) serve an indispensable role in preserving the integrity of computer networks.   This comes to manifest as the DOE  is working at a national level to secure a number of strategic network entry points using Bro [DOE06, DOE09], a powerful NIDS developed  by the networking group at the International Computer Science Institute (ICSI) in Berkeley, California.  Existing NIDS such as Bro, however, have been for the most part deployed as single-node appliances protecting a specific network asset.   This architecture is being driven to a breaking  point by two independent realities: first, as network data-rates increase, single-node NIDS boxes are being overwhelmed  by the quantity of computation they must perform to continuously secure the network; second, as attacks become ever more sophisticated, NIDS have to incorporate more complex traffic analysis heuristics that further stress the systems processing capacity.To address these trends, we are developing a cyber-security intelligent load balancer for securing terabit-scale network facilities. Our technology is unique in that it incorporates Bro into the load balancer to address the problem of optimally mapping network traffic into IDS (intrusion detection system) nodes. Our research starts by recognizing first the two essential (indivisible) elements of the architecture, forwarders and analyzers, and developing a framework toward the composition of terabit-scale cyber-security clusters. This leads to a fractal- like architecture which, thanks to its self-similarity properties, allows for a methodology to arbitrarily scale up or down the performance of the cluster in two dimensions:  degree of cyber-intelligence detected and packet forwarding performance. In Phase I we developed a fully operational prototype of our architecture at 10Gbps.  We demonstrated that by adding intelligence to the system, an important amount of low-entropy trafficthat is, traffic that carries little or no cyber-intelligencecan be offloaded from the cloud, increasing the degree of cyber-intelligence extracted from the network while yielding substantial energy savings.  As compared to the current state-of-the-art, our architecture allows for larger degree of intelligence extracted per unit of cost (in terms of CAPEX and OPEX costs). This new degree of efficiency is key toward efficiently securing private and public network assets from external cyber-threats. In Phase II, our objective is to scale up our cloud-based IDS technology to secure network facilities that operate at up to terabit per second traffic rates.  To achieve such objective, we have designed an architecture that can flexibly adjust the degree of intelligence performed by each node as a function of current traffic demands and the systems state.  This leads to the notion of an elastic cyber-security cloud, understood as a virtual facility which can organically grow by adding more physical nodes.   Furthermore, since our technology is based on Bro, a project driven by an open source community of developers, the cloud will be able to accept progressively higher degrees of intelligence as newer and more sophisticated Bro cyber-security applications continue to be developed by the community. This technology will provide a key element in the effort of securing US network-based facilities, whether private or public. The technology will therefore target customers that have large network assets, including corporations, Internet Service Providers and Government.",

        "abstract": "Particle detectors for nuclear physics and high energy physics experiments require high performance, high sensitivity digitizers for read-out electronics. Analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) are used in such applications but limit experimental results because of a restrictive combination of speed, resolution, power, and radiation-hardness. Many instruments need very high channel counts, a costly requirement and a very difficult objective to achieve where densely packed electronics generate too much heat. General statement of how this problem or situation is being addressed. This Phase II will result in the design and fabrication of an innovative high-performance, ultra-low-power device that will incorporate 16 ADC channels on a single chip. Using radiation-hardened-by-design (RHBD) techniques and the novel topology developed and verified in Phase I, the ADC chip will be able to provide the linearity and resolution required for use in a wide range of experimental instrumentation at HEP facilities like RHIC and LHC, and in nuclear physics labs at Jefferson Lab, Oak Ridge, and others, while also lowering costs because of the high degree of channel density. What was done in Phase I? Phase I saw the design, development, and simulation of a behavioral model of the complete ADC, along with transistor-level designs of key subcircuits, including operational transconductance amplifiers (OTA), a high-speed comparator, a radiation-tolerant bandgap voltage reference (BGR), a bootstrapped high-linearity sampling switch, and a complete 2.5- bit pipeline stage. This work validated the feasibility of the overall ADC design approach. What is planned for the Phase II project? The Phase II ADC design will lead to a design and fabrication of a chip encompassing an array of 16 ADC channels, each meeting key functionality goals, including 40 MS/s sampling rate, 12-bits resolution at 10.5  11.0 effective number of bits (ENOB), and a very low power dissipation of 12 mW / channel. It will also exceed the required level of TID hardness of 3.5Mrad (Si) as well as achieve extreme tolerance to other radiation effects (e.g., neutron fluencies, SEUs, SEFIs). Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: High performance ADCs hardened to extreme levels of radiation are key components of the LHC experiment, the largest scientific experiment ever constructed. Hundreds of thousands of qualified ADCs will be needed for one detector instrument alone. The currently used ADCs at LHC will be changed to more radiation tolerant and less power consuming ADCs during the upgrade process to High Luminosity Hadron Collider (HL-LHC). Tens of thousands of new radiation hardened, low-power ADCs have been planned to be used in the upgraded Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) as well. Another scientific application for this ADC is NASAs flagship mission to the Jovian moon Europa, as the radiation levels require this type of device. The ADC can be used in defense applications, such as missile control, and federal and commercial space applications. Medical imaging is another application for the ADC",

        "abstract": "A critical aspect in Particle Accelerator Instrumentation is the precise, real-time control of the high- energy particle beams used to create the conditions required for sub-atomic physics experiments. The accelerator instrumentation systems require digital control and feedback with extremely high linearity and dynamic range to achieve system performance targets. In addition, with the added requirements of radiation hardness (because of the devices proximity to the particle beam) and low power (because of the heat generated by densely packed high performance electronics), the analog- to-digital data converter (ADC) is a critical chokepoint that must meet demanding standards. An innovative high performance ADC will be designed and fabricated as a single chip. Based on a novel time-interleaved pipeline architecture developed in Phase I, the ADC will withstand high levels of radiation while providing overall converter performance that exceeds the best conventional (non- rad-hard) ADCs available on the market today. The combinations of performance and radiation tolerance make this ADC ideal to incorporate into particle accelerator instrumentation applications. Phase I saw the design, development, and simulation of a behavioral model of the complete ADC, along with transistor-level designs of key subcircuits. The most important subcircuit, a 3 GS/s track- and-hold amplifier was designed and simulated in the most-advanced silicon germanium fabrication process with accurate transistor models, and its clock jitter, distortion and noise performance clearly exceeds any reported results.  A simple test chip was also sent out for fabrication (an achievement beyond the Phase I requirements), and will be verified/tested at the start of Phase II. This program will lead to a programmable, high speed (500 MS/s  3 GS/s), high resolution (12-14 bits) ADC for use in particle accelerator instrumentation applications. The ADC will be highly linear with an INL and DNL of no more than 0.5 LSB, an operating temperature range of at least -10 to 80C, a very high effective number of bits (ENOB) of 11.0, and a total ionization dose (TID) rating of 1 Mrad. These characteristics exceed the requirements of Topic 44g of the DOE SBIR solicitation (12-14 bits, 0.5  2 GS/s) and make this ADC highly suitable for use in particle accelerator instrumentation applications systems, even in the systems where radiation exposure would otherwise degrade performance. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: This ADC will be well-suited for other DOE nuclear physics and high-energy physics instrumentation. In addition, there is a wide range of both commercial and government applications that demand the combined high performance and radiation tolerance achieved by this design. These include space- based applications such as software-defined radio and satellite systems. The design can be further optimized for conventional, non-rad-hard applications (thus reducing the power and area requirements and boosting even further the circuit performance) to address the most advanced radar and communications systems",

        "abstract": "Science and engineering depend on evolving ever more complex software, typically coded in C++, to investigate phenomena or design sophisticated products.   The rate of delivered value for such software is often limited by its organization, and scientists/engineers spend significant effort trying to understand the code organization and restructuring the code to enable the next interesting concept or experiment to be integrated in trustworthy fashion.   This project will build Refactor++, a tool to help engineers restructure their C++ code by applying highly automated interactive support. Reliably modifying computer software is hard.  We leverage a commercial pro- gram transformation system, DMS, to handle the additional difficulties of C++: complex syntax and semantics (significantly extended by the recent C++11 standards), and DMS &amp; apos;s underlying parallel language, PARLANSE, to handle the problem caused by the growing size (millions of lines) of C++ applications.    We invent code parsing algorithms to handle the pervasive problem of capturing preprocessor directives. We encode significant knowledge about C++ into program analysis tools. We build specialized refactorings for common code restructuring tasks using the analysis tools to ensure that automated code changes made by Refactor++ are reliable, so users can apply them with impunity. Many-core parallelism of burgeoning workstations will be used to reduce response times for difficult analyses of large applications, by scaling PARLANSE from 32 to 64 bits and 64 cores. To enable wide-spread adoption and therefore benefit, we leverage existing IDEs as front-ends for Refactor++. We found a novel means to parse and retain C++ preprocessor conditionals, enabling analysis tools to process the code as the user sees it; a patent is being filed. We enhanced the existing tool &amp; apos;s C++98 front end to parse all of C++11, as well as OpenMP directives used in scientific computing.   A control flow analyzer was built for C++98 to gauge the effort of building a full flow analyzer; that analyzer was harnessed to find certain types of inefficient C++ operations invisible to programmers.   An initial robust Renaming refactoring was implemented for a wide variety of C++ entities. An architecture for a full generic client-server based Refactor++ tool was designed. A plan for engineering a 64 bit PARLANSE to run on both Windows and Linux systems was devised. Symbol table, control and dataflow analysis algorithms that account for preprocessor conditionals will be implemented for full C++11.  A variety of useful analyzers (locate precise definition/use, find dead/duplicate code, expose potential parallelism) and refactoring actions (rename, move code entity, restructure #include nests, remove duplicated code) will be implemented on top of a structure editor embedded in a Refactoring server.  A widely available client IDE (Eclipse) will be integrated with the Refactoring server.  A 64 bit PARLANSE compiler ecosystem will be built using DMS &amp; apos;s present transformation capability as the compiler foundation.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  Modern science, ever more dependent on supercomputing, will produce results faster, improving US society and economic prowess. Already-ubiquitous embedded systems can provide more capability in shorter engineering windows. Parallel computing will become somewhat easier to accomplish due to engineers insight into operation of their software, and restructuring to avoid misunderstandings and coding flaws.  The infrastructure supporting Refactor++ will be applicable to other computer languages, eventually benefiting the entire software development community.",

        "abstract": "Diffusion barriers used in Nb3Sn wire are currently fabricated by wrapping Ta sheet into a tube with an overlap seam.  The result of current practice is non- uniform deformation in the Ta sheet as it thins by wire drawing because of non-uniform grain size and texture.  In addition, a significant portion of the diffusion barrier is twice as thick as need be. The overlap is wasteful of Ta and produces asymmetric internal deformation forces and consequent non-uniform deformation in the wire. Severe plastic deformation (SPD) processing will be used to refine and homogenize the microstructure of seam-welded Ta tube for subsequent fabrication into Nb3Sn diffusion barriers. Careful selection of deformation route and heat treatment conditions during the processing steps will produce a fine grain uniform microstructure with favorable texture in the tube, leading to improved co-deformability with other conductor components (Cu, Nb, and Sn) and lower manufacturing costs. Phase I work includes 1) developing equipment and procedures for SPD processing seam-welded Ta tube, 2 refining/homogenizing the grain structure in Ta tube, and 3) microstructure examination and mechanical testing of processed Ta tube to assess quality for diffusion barrier applications.   Material property comparisons with commercial Ta sheet will be used as a baseline for evaluating project success. Phase II work includes construction of scaled-up equipment for SPD processing of Ta tube, SPD processing of appropriate outside diameter thin wall Ta tube, pilgering or drawing of the processed tube into prototype thin wall diffusion barrier tube, and fabricating/testing prototype Nb3Sn wire including the Ta tube.  Wire manufacturing and performance experiments will assess the improvement in fabricability of the specially processed Ta tube compared with comparable wire made with commercial Ta sheet.  A cost/benefit analysis will assess technical viability of the new technology for fabrication of Ta tubes. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: The commercial application is to apply this technology to the production of Ta tube for lower cost and higher quality Nb3Sn conductors.  Cabot and H.C. Starck, Inc. may be interested in using this technology for other tubular products.   The approach used could be applicable to the fabrication of other tube materials including niobium, titanium and zirconium.",

        "abstract": "Diamond crystals with small total thickness variation (TTV) and local thickness variation (LTV) values are needed for position sensitive fast particle detectors for particle tracking/timing, and detecting direct/indirect beams. The fabrication of ultra-flat, low surface defectivity diamond detectors represents a major technological challenge. Although current commercial technology can produce 100m thick, high quality diamond crystals, the current state-of-the- art polishing methods are unable to polish diamond crystals with low thickness variation (typically lesser than few microns). Sinmat has developed a novel reactive chemical mechanical polishing (RCMP) process to polish, planarized, and flatten diamond crystals free of surface/subsurface defects. By combining this RCMP process with special engineered sample holders, ultra-low TTV and LTV surfaces can be fabricated (with TTV lesser than 1 micron) for high performance detector applications. In  the  Phase  I  part  of  the  project,  Sinmat  had demonstrated ultra flat diamond crystals with surfaces free of damage and scratches. By combining the RCMP process and special samples holders, we were able to achieve ultra-flat surfaces. Such RCMP polished diamond crystals have shown excellent detector performance with 3X increase in pulse height. In the Phase II effort, the RCMP process will be further optimized to achieve ultra low TTV diamond crystal detectors for beam tracking applications at FRIB- NSCL facilities.  Commercial Application and Other Benefits: The ability to achieve ultra-flat and defect free diamond crystals will be very beneficial for several applications in the fields of nuclear instrumentation, nuclear radiators, X-ray optics, and next generation electronics. Such devices will help in improving detection systems, instrumentation, and various techniques used in nuclear physics.

        "abstract": "Positron  Emission  Tomography  (PET)  is  a  molecular  imaging  modality  that  utilizes  radiolabeled molecules (probes) to target and measure biological processes. Basic scientists can use the same probes to  examine  microorganisms,  cells,  and  mice  as  they  do  in  patients  to  visualize  and  characterize  the biology of disease, monitor its progression, and evaluate therapeutic efficacy. Although over 1,600 PET probes have been developed to help answer a variety of biological questions, and could potentially lead to new diagnostic and therapeutic tools for further study, only the glucose analog 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ([18F]FDG) is routinely used. This limitation exists because of the centralized radiopharmacy approach  to  PET  probe  production,  with  its  complexity,  high  infrastructure  cost,  and  necessity  of specialized equipment and skilled personnel. An  alternative,  decentralized  approach  to PET  probe  development  is  required  to  give  scientists  the freedom to determine what probes they want to use to best solve the problems of their interest. This goal can be achieved by building a benchtop, computer-controlled, microfluidic chip-based commercial device for the on-demand production of PET probes. Phase I of this project answered  basic commercial  feasibility  questions  about the underlying  Electro- Wetting-On-Dielectric  (EWOD)  microfluidic  chip technology,  including:  (1) the suitability  of EWOD chips based on printed-circuit-board (PCB) technology to reduce costs of radiosynthesis chips; (2) the repeatability  of  synthesis  process  parameters  and  outcomes;  (3)  coupling  of  a  miniature  purification system  to the prototype  chip; and (4) establishing  the versatility  of the platform  through  synthesis  of additional PET compounds other than [18F]FDG. Phase II will produce a commercial prototype platform for the point-of-use production of PET probes. This platform will include: (1) a computer-based control system; (2) an inexpensive, disposable, probe- specific cassette of chips and reagents; and (3) a compact, benchtop housing that serves to shield the end user from radiation. As an eventual product, a library of cassettes will be developed based on customer needs for different probes. Shifting to a point-of-research/point-of-care model is a transformational solution that circumvents the limitations imposed by the centralized model on probe production, cost, and diversity. By empowering scientists and clinicians to control the development and use of PET probes, they are able to focus on processes that they believe are most important for the environmental and biological sciences.",

        "abstract": "The Arctic as a region of particular sensitivity to climate change. In the past few decades, the annual average temperature over the Northern high latitude land surface has risen at almost twice the rate of the global average, disrupting the region and its people.  Clouds are the primary factors that influence radioactive fluxes in the Arctic, and thus the rate of warming and ice melt. Long-term in situ measurements of Arctic cloud properties are needed to improve climate prediction models. Tethered balloon systems with sensors to measure cloud properties have recently been flown in Arctic and Antarctic.  However, the technology is still in its infancy and new and  innovative  approaches  are  needed  to  reliably  deploy  more  sophisticated  instrument  packages. Second-generation tethered balloon systems are being designed to be more robust and the instruments are being made smaller, lighter and capable of collecting even more sophisticated measurements. In Phase I the winch and tether systems that were previously used to deploy balloons with instrument packages underwent extensive engineering and laboratory tests, resulting in a design of a far more robust deployment system.   The instrument package was evaluated and new miniature instruments were designed in-house or subcontracts were arranged for them to be built in Phase II.  Proof-of-concept laboratory tests were performed and a top- down design of a new tethered balloon deployment and measurement package was designed.  The focus of the second-generation tethered balloon system is to improve our understanding of the properties of Arctic clouds and thereby reduce the uncertainties in climate prediction models. The results from laboratory tests and engineering designs generated in Phase I will be used to build and field-test a second-generation tethered balloon system in Phase II. A redesigned, more robust winch and tether system will loft a balloon to 2 km within a restricted area near the companys home office.  An automatic balloon deflation and tracking system will be tested with a dummy instrument package.  A new composite optical probe that records high-resolution digital images and size distributions of cloud particles from 1 micron to 6.4 mm will be fabricated and calibrated in the laboratory. Other new instruments that will be integrated and tested are a near infrared radiometer, filter systems to collect and analyze aerosols and ice nuclei, an optical cloud condensation nucleus counter and a lidar that makes volumetric measurements of cloud drop size and water content. The second-generation tethered balloon system will then be deployed to a DOE site at Oliktok Point on the North Slope of Alaska to conduct a demonstration project to collect data in Arctic mixed-phase clouds. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  If global warming continues at its present rate in the Arctic, the effects on the region and its people will be devastating.  In addition, if warming continues and melts the Greenland icecap, the effect on coastal areas will be disastrous. To prepare for and possibly mitigate these potential effects, improved climate prediction models are needed, which requires a better understanding of the properties of Arctic clouds. The demonstration project planned in Phase II at the DOE site, Oliktok Point on the North Slope of Alaska, will establish the viability of tethered balloon systems to make long- term in situ measurements of the properties of Arctic mixed-phase clouds, which predominate in the Arctic. Once the viability and value of the tethered balloon system is established, other sites in the Arctic are likely to be established, providing commercial opportunities and a better global representation of the effects of Arctic clouds in climate prediction models.",

However, advances in detector technology have not kept pace with advances in synchrotron brightness, leading to limitations on scientific output and research capabilities. In Phase I, STAR Cryoelectronics developed an innovative and streamlined process for the fabrication of high energy resolution, high count rate superconducting tunnel junction (STJ) X- ray detectors based on Ta thin films that will meet growing needs for advanced detectors for synchrotron science applications. Several prototype STJ detectors and detector arrays were successfully fabricated and characterized during Phase I. Record energy resolution has been achieved, and multi-pixel arrays with up to 112 pixels were successfully fabricated. During Phase II, STAR Cryoelectronics plans to further improve energy resolution, increase the maximum count rate per pixel, and enhance production yield and detector reliability. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  The new STJ detector arrays represent the enabling technology for two significant commercial applications: X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) at the synchrotron, which is used to study the local molecular and electronic structure of specific elements, and X-ray microanalysis in conjunction with a scanning electron microscope (SEM), which is used for defect and failure analysis. XAS samples can be highly diluted and generally do not require substantial pre- treatment, and they can range from chemicals and biological samples or tissues to soils and rocks.

We propose to develop advanced wound capacitors with a specialty flexible ultrathin glass with high dielectric constant, low dielectric loss, high thermal stability, and high breakdown strength. The capacitors will combine ultrahigh energy density, high energy efficiency, and low-cost commercial manufacturability. Systematic test on the glass samples confirmed that the high dielectric constant glass has high dielectric breakdown strength, high energy density, and high charge- discharge efficiency. The ultrathin glass is flexible and can wound to a small radius without damage. Proprietary coating technology was developed to significantly improve the dielectric breakdown strength and the reliability. The ultrathin glass sheet will be further improved so that the high performance of the glass can be fully transferred to large prototype capacitors. Advanced capacitor design will be performed to increase the energy density and lifetime of the capacitors so they can meet the customer requirement. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: The ultrahigh energy density glass capacitors with high reliability will enable the miniaturization of many power electronic devices. Potential applications include capacitors for hybrid electric vehicles, plug-in electric vehicles, high power strobe lights, defibrillators, and uninterruptable power supplies",

        "abstract": "Continued global dependence on fossil fuels and concomitant release of CO2 has driven a societal push to mitigate CO2 emissions, largely through various means of sequestration. But implementation of carbon sequestration costs money and there are still unresolved environmental concerns, therefore, other approaches to mitigating net CO2 production and release are required. In an ideal model, emitted CO2 could be used as a feedstock for producing solid products and chemicals, which are inherently stable for long periods of time and can be continually recycled without significant CO2 emissions. The intrinsic value of these products, combined with a low cost way of producing them transforms the economic equation such that a societal problem becomes an opportunity. This project focuses on the development of an Electrochemical Polymer Precursor Generation (EPPG) system that will efficiently generate carboxylic acids which serve as precursors to polymer synthesis.  When integrated with clean electricity sources such as renewables, this system can cost effectively transform waste CO2 molecules into valuable products at the industrial scale.  Phase I is focused on the development of the fundamental process technology while Phase II is devoted to integration of this technology into a viable system package. In Phase I the fundamental process to convert CO2 to polymer precursors was validated using laboratory hardware.  Laboratory tests provided critical parametric data that permitted a techno-economic evaluation of a large-scale concept and showed that 100% conversion efficiency was achievable.  Phase II will build upon the success of Phase I by scaling the electrochemical cell hardware and optimizing operating conditions to assure high efficiency, long-term operation.  A fully integrated system package having the capability of producing 1 kg/dy of carboxylic acids will be built and tested in this program. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  Development of an EPPG system provides a means of effectively transforming waste CO2 into useful commodity chemicals used in the manufacture of durable goods.  By generating the precursors for synthesis of polymers and other products, it reduces our need for hydrocarbon resources.",

        "abstract": "Photocathodes with spin-polarized electron emission are used in physics research. Current photocathodes offer high polarization, but low total currents, and have limited lifetime. Research involving these polarized electrons would be more productive if a higher electron current were provided. This program seeks to increase the delivered polarized electron current from the photocathodes by adding integrated light reflectors to the device structure. These reflectors could concentrate more light energy to the creation of electron current, rather than being wasted as heat in present designs. As a consequence, these photocathodes would also have longer lifetimes. In the Phase I approaches and materials were assayed to best reach the goal of a high current spin polarized photocathode. A prototype design for such a device was developed and deemed feasible for production in a Phase II. The Phase II will fabricate and characterize the device design postulated by the Phase I. As part of the fabrication process several tools will be applied to the growth process to ensure that the end product has the highest chances for success. Spin-polarized electrons have particular application in the field of experimental physics.  A subset of this is research into subatomic particles and anti-matter. On a more accessible level such electrons are used in spin polarized low energy electron microscopy, which allows certain materials to be probed to reveal novel properties.

        "abstract": "The electricity produced from fossil fuels is essential to the prosperity and security of the world.  On the other hand, increasing atmospheric concentrations of CO2 caused by the fossil fuel combustion is causing concern regarding global warming.  Although there are several methods for separating CO2 from the flue gases at existing coal-fired power plants, all of them have significant drawbacks, including loss of efficiency and increased capital and operating costs that dramatically increase the cost of electricity.TDA Research, Inc. (TDA) proposes to develop a low cost, high capacity sorbent to remove CO2 from coal-fired power plant effluents. In Phase I, we prepared various low cost sorbent formulations and screened them to determine their capacity to absorb CO2 under representative conditions.  We also demonstrated the performance of the sorbent made from low cost precursors through 1,250 adsorption/regeneration cycles. Based on the performance results, we carried out a preliminary design of our novel CO2 capture system, estimated its size and cost, and carried out an engineering assessment to compare it to alternative processes. The analysis showed that our process will reduce the power output of the plant by only 7.8% (the reduction in efficiency will be 21.7%, compared with a reduction of 35% for amine scrubbers). In Phase II, we will continue to improve our sorbent, optimizing its chemical composition and physical properties and scale-up its production using high throughput equipment.  We will demonstrate the sorbent performance   in   a   moving   bed   system   and   test   the   sorbents   durability   through   10,000 adsorption/regeneration cycles.  We will also carry out slipstream demonstration tests using actual flue gas to fully assess the sorbent performance.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  CO2 is a major greenhouse gas, and the major source for the anthropogenic CO2 emissions. It is the result of the combustion of fossil fuels, in particular the burning coal to generate electricity.   The proposed technology will provide a cost effective way to control CO2 emissions from the existing coal-fired power plants, and therefore will have a large market when legislation limiting or taxing carbon emissions is put in place.",

        "abstract": "The successful operation of the Department of Energy X-ray light sources, free electron laser, and linear accelerator facilities depends on providing reliable photocathodes for generation of low emittance, high-brightness electron beams using conventional lasers.  Experiments on GaAs-based photocathodes have demonstrated the potential to generate high-brightness, unpolarized and polarized, electron beams with low emittance.  However, high-fidelity simulation capabilities are needed to design and engineer robust GaAs photocathodes that meet or exceed the desired operational parameters for research facilities run by the Department of Energy. Three dimensional, particle-in-cell codes can accurately simulate the evolution of electron beams in accelerator cavities but lack algorithms for modeling the physics of electron emission from photocathodes. We will develop and implement software code for modeling electron emission from GaAs photo cathodes within the VORPAL Computational Framework to enable simulations of the complete electron generation process including creation of electron-hole pairs due to photon absorption, transport of charge carriers, and emission from negative electron affinity surfaces. We investigated and implemented proof-of-concept algorithms for photon absorption distributions and a three band model for electron transport in GaAs. Results from VORPAL transport simulations with the prototyped algorithms are in agreement with existing experimental and numerical data.  These results demonstrate the importance of the new capabilities for high-fidelity modeling of GaAs photocathodes. We will implement accurate modeling of electron emission, surface band banding potentials, effects of surface roughness, localized states, and varying electron affinity to enable detailed investigation of electron emission from GaAs via simulations.  We have designed experiments to collect data for validation of the implemented models. We will run extensive simulations to compare with experimental data and investigate time response, emittance, and energy distribution properties of electrons emitted from GaAs.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: The proposed code for high-fidelity simulations of GaAs photocathodes will directly benefit scientists designing electron sources for industrial and modern research facility applications. The new simulation capabilities will also allow the existing code VORPAL (already commercially distributed) to increase its potential for generating further commercial revenue when used in the industry to design photocathodes and semiconductor devices.",

Using the Genetic Algorithm Driven Decision Support System (GADDSS) the instrument user can steer the analysis as well as the instrument in support of the fastest time to solution. GADDSS aims to utilize parallel HPC resources to aide in the molecular structure determination, refinement, and visualization for the TOPAZ and SNAP instruments at the Spallation Neutron Source by providing a conduit for real-time on-the-fly analysis and experiment decision support. The Orbiter platform will provide federated user authentication and facilitate live data streaming, processing, visualization and storage enabling real-time experiment decision support. Orbiter is comprised of modular, scalable, and secure services that provide a solid foundation  for building sophisticated capabilities and user interfaces that can be used to facilitate live data processing and visualization  for a samples molecular structure of while it is still in the beam, allowing  for enhanced experiment control and beam time optimization. We propose that this platform can be extended to other instruments and DOE BES facilities to provide real- time decision support for facility users, and can be made available commercially as a robust experiment data analysis and visualization  application. The primary success of the GADDSS project was the implementation of a robust experiment data process- in, analysis, and decision support workflow demonstrating the feasibility of achieving a real-time analysis and decision support system. We have prototyped automated analysis and optimization tools that facilitate a streamlined point-and-click process of refining molecular structures from experiment data, and we have demonstrated the feasibility enabling access to key facility resources as well as incorporating other community software tools for an enhanced end-user experience. We will continue to aggressively build on the existing prototype an incorporate several additional components and improvements that we have identified.  Automated data analysis and optimization capabilities including detector boundary peak salvage, 1D Time of Flight peak fitting, and new peak integration methods and models are a priority. We will enhance the decision support capabilities of the user interface, and adapt GADDSS to support other instruments at the Spallation Neutron Source and High Flux Isotope Reactor. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  The successful development of the proposed Department of Energy GADDSS project will directly benefit US neutron facilities. The early adopters, the TOPAZ, SNAP, MANDI, and IMAGINE instruments at the DOE BES facilities, will have the potential to more efficiently utilize beam experiment time.

Unfortunately, visualization tools presently lack the ability to represent edge-centered, face-centered and other types of staggered data, which arise in electromagnetic and computational fluid dynamics studies. We will attach offset metadata information to each field and augment/modify each filter in the DOE funded visualization tool VisIt.  Some filters will require interpolation methods to modify the target position, other filters will require the mesh coordinates to be adjusted. We have demonstrated in VisIt a method that improves the accuracy of streamline integration by correcting the interpolation with the field offsets. The improvement removes spurious effects, such as streamline spiraling, symmetry breaking, and violation of constraints at the boundary. Full support of staggered fields will be added to VisIt across all pipelines and operators for structured meshes. Secondly, we will help the scientific community take advantage of these features, if necessary modifying their input file format and the corresponding VisIt database plug-in readers. Thirdly, we will leverage our technological know-how by developing the first commercial application that fully supports multiple types of field staggering (PerceptEM) for electromagnetic applications.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: There are three types of beneficiaries in this project.

Secondly, the value of the commercial code VORPAL will increase after introducing our changes to the Vorpal Composer graphical user interface.  This will provide a competitive advantage to VORPAL, which will result in a higher resell price and/or larger sale volume.

In addition to climate variability and change over the lifetime of a wind production facility, other meteorological factors such as interannual variability and atmospheric turbulence have the potential to alter the characteristics of the climate variables affecting wind energy production.     We propose to develop software tools to allow wind energy stakeholders to assess the uncertainties of interannual variability, atmospheric turbulence, and climate change on wind power production.  To lay the groundwork for this effort, we will integrate pointmeasurements, regional climate simulations, and global climate models from the Department of Energy  Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison archive to quantify the meteorological uncertainties in wind power production.  In Phase I, we developed and tested techniques for the quantification of uncertainties in wind resource assessment associated with climate change, interannual climate variability, and atmospheric turbulence.

In Phase II, we will build a prototype software product that provides accessible project analysis and visualization with atmospheric uncertainties shaping power production taken into account. The Phase II effort will produce a commercial prototype that will incorporate climate change and other meteorological effects along with engineering considerations into long-term wind farm project analysis and risk assessment.

Presently available millimeter-wave receivers are unable to meet this requirement. Virginia Diodes proposes a system of three state-of-the-art heterodyne receivers, each of which will cover one-third of the desired ITER band. The input waveguides of these receivers will be combined into a single guide using an innovative waveguide triplexer. A quasi-optical system will couple the triplexer to the ITER system. The most important innovations in the project are VDIs efforts to fundamentally improve the performance and reliability of the receivers. These include a new fabrication technology for the diode integrated circuits and methods to improve the IF bandwidth of the mixers. VDI successfully demonstrated the proposed IC fabrication technology, demonstrated the IF bandwidth required for the ITER receivers while increasing also reliability, and conducted an initial reliability study of the receiver technology. The basic technology for the waveguide triplexer was also demonstrated. The Phase 2 plan culminates in the demonstration and delivery of a functional receiver system for the ITER ECE Radiometer system. Primary research areas include; the development of a highly integrated receiver architecture using both the new diode integrated circuit technology and the integration of many circuit functions into the same housing, the development of the new waveguide triplexer, the development and evaluation of the three receiver systems, the demonstration of the complete ITER system, and a thorough study of reliability of all system components and sub-systems.

The performance of one new type of instrument, the wide-angle polarized neutron spectrometer, is severely constrained by the volume of polarized3 He gas that can be produced and the level of polarization that it can maintain. Currently 3He polarizers produced in Europe based on Metastability Exchange Optical Pumping dominate the international market, with existing installations in Germany and France and two multimillion dollar contracts recently closed for ISIS in England and ANSTO in Australia. Even those systems have limitations in capacity and reliability, leading developers of new wide-angle spectrometers, such as the TOPAS group at Jlich, to seek an alternative with greater capacity, higher polarization, and better reliability. In an ongoing parallel project, our team developed a large-scale 3He polarizer based on Hybrid-alkali Spin Exchange Optical Pumping. By illuminating a large 8.5 liter glass polarizer cell inside a pressure vessel with a 1.2 kW laser we demonstrated spin-up rates of 20% per hour for 50 STP liters, a world record. We recently upgraded that polarizer with a custom-built 2.5 kW spectrally-narrowed laser and a fully integrated support infrastructure. Testing of new monolithic glass cells in this upgraded polarizer is imminent. In Phase 1 of this project, we demonstrated feasibility for utilizing this large-scale 3He polarizer to allow automated filling and emptying of a large analyzer with minimal polarization losses. In particular, we proposed and accomplished four objectives: we designed and had built a non-ferrous vacuum pump capable of evacuating a 40 liter analyzer volume in 15 minutes with minimal polarization loss. We operated the compressor, demonstrating it can transfer helium from 100 torr to 8000 torr, simulating the required evacuation of the analyzer volume back into the polarizer. We developed a sapphire orifice throttle and installed it and the compressor in a rig for testing their polarization preserving properties. We began characterizing polarization losses using an integrated NMR system. These substantial accomplishments within a nine- month Phase 1 project give confidence that the technical challenges of assembling a high- polarization, low-loss, long-running prototype will be accomplished within our Phase 2 plan. Our overall plan seeks routine operation of a 40 liter neutron analyzer with average polarization exceeding 75%, a challenging goal demanded by the science. Since our exotic pump arrived just as Phase I ended, our first aim for Phase II is a thorough study of the existing setup. We will also extend our archival measurements of surface relaxivity to various metal, ceramic, and plastic materials to guide our choices for use in the final pumping system, transfer lines, valves, and orifices. Our second aim is to improve our polarizer. We will develop materials processing techniques that will allow our cells to be blown from GE180, and retrofit our laser with dedicated components that achieve 2.5kW with 0.15nm line width. Our third aim is to incorporate new subsystems and implement process automation that will be essential for routine operation of a large-scale 3He polarizer and wide-angle neutron analyzer.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: We estimate a market size of a dozen large scale 3He polarizer-analyzer systems for fundamental and applied physics research over the next decade, with synergistic benefits in pediatric lung imaging.",

        "abstract": "Major upgrades or new constructions at the nations nuclear research facilities require continuing development of the state-of-the-art instrumentation, detectors and readout electronics. As nuclear physicists increasingly design large scale radiation detectors, there are growing needs for high density low cost readout electronics. However, existing off-the-shelf readout electronics are prohibitively expensive for large scale radiation detectors. Affordable digital readout electronics with good time and energy resolution are critically needed to address this need. In this project, we propose to develop a high density, low cost digital spectrometer module that can address the needs in the nuclear physics community to instrument large scale radiation detectors at relatively low cost. The module will be a true spectrometer: able to capture waveforms and provide good energy and timing resolution while its cost per channel can be reduced by as much as a factor of 10 compared to that of existing digital readout modules. In Phase I, different architectures for the proposed high density low cost module were compared and an optimal architecture was chosen for building a Phase II prototype. A prototype circuit board was built to verify Gigabit per second connectivity between multi-channel analog-to-digital converters and low cost field programmable gate arrays. Gamma-ray spectroscopic performances of chosen multi-channel analog- to-digital converters were measured. The goals of the Phase II research are to build a prototype for the proposed high density low cost module; develop firmware and software to operate the module; characterize its gamma-ray spectroscopic performances in XIAs laboratories; and test it at potential customers sites (e.g. national laboratories, universities) to verify its performance with large scale radiation detectors.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  The proposed instrument has a wide area of applications in various scientific experiments. The increasing needs for improved time, position, and energy resolution in nuclear physics experiments have spurred the rapid development of commercial off-the-shelf high speed, high resolution digitizers or spectrometers. However, it is impractical to use existing readout electronics to instrument experiments involving hundreds to thousands of radiation detectors due to their high cost per channel. The proposed instrument will fill an important need for affordable electronics that can instrument large scale radiation detectors at relatively low cost.",

In Phase II, we will develop a fully-operational, fully-integrated Aladdin Payload enabling a PackBot EOD to quickly move through an indoor environment containing closed doors under semi-autonomous control.

Guided by an empirically-derived theoretical model of cognitive readiness, CREATOR will be designed to support three primary functions: (1) Monitor cognitive readiness; (2) Evaluate cognitive readiness; and (3) Augment cognitive readiness. These functions will be supported at both the individual and command (team) levels and will involve using a distinct set of applications designed to monitor, evaluate, and augment cognitive readiness.

        "abstract": "Ocean wave energy has the potential to support 8% of domestic and global electricity demand. Despite considerable investment over the past decade, however, wave energy is unlikely to make a material contribution to domestic or global energy supplies unless new technologies with significantly lower capital costs and higher reliability than todays leading technologies can be developed and commercialized. Through this project, a novel wave energy harvesting technology that is enabled by low-cost magnetostrictive materials and requires no moving parts to generate electricity will undergo its first open- ocean demonstration. This technology has strong potential to deliver electricity at costs competitive with conventional power sources. In Phase I, design features that enable the technologys power generation modules to survive extreme waves were developed and tested. Prototype power generation modules were built and tested to show that they could withstand expected fatigue loads and hydrostatic pressure. Finally, detailed hydrodynamic modeling of the system was used to determine a system configuration for deployment in Phase II. In Phase II, a sub-scale wave energy harvester with 1:2 scale power generation modules will be designed, built and demonstrated at an open ocean test site. In addition, key components of the system will be demonstrated in the lab at the full scale. Successful execution of Phase II will sufficiently de-risk the technology such that the resources and partnerships can be secured for deployment and demonstration of a sub-scale system with full scale power generation modules, the final step before we build our first commercial-scale system. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: Development and commercialization of the technology has the potential to significantly impact the renewable energy landscape by dramatically reducing the cost, improving the robustness and broadening the availability of wave energy. Successful development and commercialization of the technology will improve the nations competitiveness while reducing global emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants.\n",

This provides the radars with the capability to track and prosecute multiple targets while simultaneously maintaining surveillance fences, cueing other sensors/shooters, supporting communications, and executing electronic and signals intelligence tasks. In order to maximize the tactical effectiveness of these types sensors, the aforementioned capabilities require enhanced automated and operator coordinated resource management strategies. In fact, the operator coordination of the sensor can be viewed as a tasking overlay on the sensors automated resource management responsibilities that seek to balance the duty and occupancy of the sensor. Operators require training to maximize the effective employment of the sensor in various engagement scenarios. Effective training in the use and testing of AESA radar systems and tactics requires a platform that enables the modeling of real-world effects on the sensor in various tactical scenarios. Broadening the test and evaluation envelope will enable the United States to field AESA systems with greater effectiveness at lower costs.

Cooling loads for these detectors will range from 0.25 W to 1.0 W at the primary load site, with additional loads at higher temperatures.  During this program, we propose to build and test a multi-stage hybrid cryocooler that is optimized for cooling at a primary load temperature of 10 to 20 K.  The hybrid cryocooler will optimally combine the strengths of multiple cryocooler technologies.  Performance predictions indicate that our hybrid cryocooler concept will result in a 200% improvement in efficiency over the current state of-the-practice unit which will allow landmark reductions in payload mass.  In addition to high efficiency, the system will be lightweight and extremely reliable, and will produce negligible vibration at the coldheads, provide remote and distributed cooling at each stage, and be broadly applicable to cooling temperatures from 10 K to 100 K.  During Phase I, we optimized the cryocooler design for a particular mission class.  We used existing test data and analytical models to predict the performance of both a flight cryocooler and a brassboard unit which will be tested during the Phase II project.  On the Phase II project, we will test the hybrid cryocooler at cold end temperatures as low as 10 K.  BENEFIT:  The successful completion of this program will result in the demonstration of an extremely efficient low temperature cryocooler.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The ideal see-through display would be one that preserves situational awareness by offering a panoramic view of the surroundings with overlaid high-resolution color imagery. Such a system should also be unobtrusive; that is, compact, light-weight, and comfortable, where comfort comes from having a generous exit pupil, liberal eye relief, ergonomic center of mass, and focus at infinity. Conventional refractive optics cannot satisfy this suite of demanding requirements. Even after years of highly competitive development, head-mounted displays (HMDs) exhibit limited field of view and are anything but compact, light-weight, and comfortable. SGB Labs has developed a game-changing solution to this challenging problem by successfully demonstrating an ultra-wide field-of-view see-through display with a pixel resolution that supports Snellen 20/20 visual acuity over the entire field of view. In Phase I, a practicable design for a full-color see-through display was developed. Phase I also developed a novel planar manufacturing concept for creating such optical systems with vastly improved size, weight, and cost. In Phase II, the design and the new manufacturing process will be reduced to practice. A prototype of a sensor-agnostic color HMD with leap-ahead performance in terms of field of view and angular resolution will be developed and delivered for evaluation.  BENEFIT:  A see-through display focused at infinity must satisfy a suite of very challenging requirements; including wide field of view, high resolution, full color, good luminance, adequate dynamic grayscale, and minimal power consumption. To date, no waveguide technology has been able to satisfy these critical requirements, the most important being wide field of view. SBG Labs&quot;technology enables the first waveguide-based display with the ability to meet all requirements. The benefit to the warfighter will be vastly improved situational awareness and comfort. The technology is especially suitable for applications involving augmented reality and virtual reality. A wide-field-of-view see-through display is a dual-use product. SBG Labs hopes to leverage the proposed development into OEM components for consumer HMDs. The channel to market will be the same as SBG Labs&quot;other products: major consumer electronics companies. In the short term, since military devices will support a higher price point than commercial ones and entail lower production volumes, having the DoD as its first customer will enable SBG Labs to gradually ramp up its manufacturing infrastructure and engineer out the cost. In the long term, commercial demand will far outstrip defense demand, driving down cost to the DoD and spurring further technical development.",

        "abstract": "To address the Navy&quot;s need for electrostatics-based technologies for a protective coating application to complex ship structural surfaces, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to continue developing a new Alternating Injected Charge Electrospray (ALICE) technology. The prototype device built in Phase I is based on a new design that utilizes in-house developed proprietary components and COTS components. The innovation in charge injection methodology and control of the spraying process enables the ALICE coating system to produce uniform, edge-retentive, defect-free protective coatings on grounded metallic surfaces, while maintaining excellent compatibility with the wide range of Navy-qualified coating systems. As a result, this innovative technology offers non-line-of-sight, wrap-around structure coating, eliminating the overhead of unnecessary touch-ups, directly addressing the Ship&quot;s PEO requirements for a reliable method for coating irregularly shaped shipboard structures, such as ballast tanks, cargo holds, and hull voids. In Phase I, POC demonstrated the feasibility of ALICE by fabricating and testing a proof-of-concept prototype, evaluating the new approach versus the state-of-the-art electrostatic and nonelectric technologies, and creating a plan for Phase II. In Phase II, POC plans to develop and manufacture a practical, shipyard-deployable coating system, along with operational protocols and documentation, for initial testing at a Navy shipbuilding facility.",

However, frequent replacement is usually required for these test papers in outdoor applications because of the degradation by exposure to sun, dust, and rain. Moreover, visual inspection is needed to assess each test paper, so a self-reporting system is critical to reducing the personnel needed for inspection. Intelligent Optical Systems (IOS) proposes to continue the development of a field-rugged, colorimetric sensor array that can detect multiple CWAs, in both aerosol and vapor phase, in adverse environments. The sensor array will detect threatening CWAs and generate a visual self-reporting readout. The Phase I results have demonstrated the feasibility of highly stable polymer claddings overcoming the instability of current M8 test paper. The material being developed will perform vapor phase detection, and will be self-reporting, eliminating the need for visual inspection. In Phase II, IOS will build on the successful Phase I results to finalize, optimize, and produce a manufacturing plan for the improved detection platform.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Airborne ISR platforms are intensive data generators and require more robust SATCOM links in order to remain effective.  One method of achieving higher datarates is by migrating to higher frequencies such as the 71  86 GHz band.  This band is currently undeveloped, especially for satellite communications. The availability of 5 GHz of bandwidth can greatly close the gap in the ever growing capacity shortfall for offloading sensor data from aircraft.  Air Force has an objective to support a new V/W band geostationary SATCOM relay system where video/data is uplinked at 8186 GHz from multiple airborne nodes and downlinked at 7176 to one of two ground stations.  This arrangement supports site diversity for weather mitigation and could potentially service 100 simultaneous platforms with data rates that range from 1 to 100&quot;s of Mbps.  There currently is no off-the-shelf antenna technology for the space segment at this band.  During this Phase II program, FIRST RF will build a prototype reflector meeting the requirements of the V/W Band SATCOM space segment.  This is in support of a follow-on effort where space-qualified antenna hardware will be procured as a result of the advances made in Phase II.    BENEFIT:  This program immediately benefits the airborne ISR community with requirements for offloading large amounts of data via gimbaled SATCOM dishes.  As active microwave circuits support higher frequencies, the datalinks currently being supported at Ku and Ka Bands could foreseeably be supported by V and W Band terminals.  This would come with two benefits: a smaller physical aperture provides the same beamwidth, and the datarates achievable are substantially higher.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes, in Phase II, to mature and implement the first-of-its-kind Chaotic-Pulse-Frequency Coding and Communication (CPCOM) system developed and proven feasible in Phase I. CPCOM addresses the Air Force need for algorithm development that will enable remote chaotic low-probability-of-intercept (LPI) communication in ad hoc networking of multiple spacecraft. In Phase I, POC demonstrated CPCOM&quot;s feasibility through design, assembly, and testing of a TRL-3+ prototype. The overall system architecture, algorithms, and system prototype design for Phase II have been developed and evaluated. The Phase I proof-of-concept CubeSat-compatible (SWAP 9.4 x 9.6 x 1.5 cm^3) prototype conclusively demonstrated the capability of CPCOM to provide secure LPI communication (&lt;10^-10) with extremely high data rate (up to several Gbps) intended for application in ad hoc networks of clusters of small satellites. In Phase II, POC will finalize development of a fully functional, CubeSat-compatible prototype system (TRL-5) capable of providing high data rate (up to 200 Mbps) and LPI communications in ad hoc networking of multiple spacecraft. Upon completion of Phase II, the prototype will be suitable for transition, in Phase III, to manufacturing of communications equipment capable of operating in space environments or in areas with electromagnetic interference.  BENEFIT:  Military applications of the CPCOM will include specialized communications (including troops and distributed sensor networks) in noisy environments, such as combat zones, where electromagnetic (EM) interference is a major limiting factor for communication or where secure covert communication is required. The CPCOM can be incorporated by border security and law enforcement agencies to improve communication equipment. Commercial applications of CPCOM include first-responder communication equipment, which will enable communication in environments with EM interference. The system provides extremely low probability of intercept communication with extremely high security and high Gbps data rate-unique features that are beyond the capabilities of current LPI communication systems.",

The Layout design through Error Aware Positioning (LEAP) technique can reduce single event error rates by several orders of magnitude through rearrangements of the layout alone. The technique incurs minimal performance penalties. It requires no changes in the manufacturing process, and can therefore be applied for manufacturing in any standard semiconductor technology, which ensures cost effective manufacturing. The tremendous error rate reductions achievable by this technique have been verified experimentally in 180nm technology and in 28nm technology.   The single event analysis and design software developed in this project is created by bringing together the advanced single event analysis tools from ISDE and RCI.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is focused on high-accuracy wireless positioning technology for indoor environments. Indoor time-of-flight-based positioning technologies have had little commercial success to date primarily because of multipath - signal reflections that smear the arrival time of the over-the-air signals, making it difficult to determine the arrival time from the line-of-sight (LOS) or shortest distance path. The best way to combat multipath is to use ultra-wideband (UWB) location beacon signals with bandwidths in excess of 500 MHz; the wide signal bandwidth increases the resolution in the time-domain, allowing the receiver to distinguish the LOS from other paths. The challenges with UWB are that it is plagued by high manufacturing costs, too much DC power consumption and regulatory issues limiting its range and operating frequencies. The focus of our research is to develop a way to overcome these limitations by defining a method for transmitting a sequence of relatively narrowband standards-based (e.g., WiFi) signals in such a way as to make them behave like UWB signals, yielding UWB-like positioning accuracy at no additional cost and without any of the other aforementioned shortcomings. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is fueled in part by the ubiquity of the smartphone, whereby a large and growing number of applications could benefit from high-accuracy indoor positioning technology, including: indoor route guidance, mobile retail (find products, receive targeted ads, use proximity-sorted shopping lists), staff and asset tracking for healthcare and manufacturing industries, indoor E911, location-based security, exhibit tracking commentary and route guidance for the blind. However, existing state-of-the-art positioning systems such as WiFi received signal strength (RSS) techniques are not accurate enough (typically 30 feet at 90% confidence) for many of these applications. There are UWB-based solutions available today that are much more accurate than their RSS counterparts, but there is strong resistance to integrating UWB into smartphones due to cost, DC power and regulatory limitations. The goal of this project is to provide a way to make straightforward modifications to a WiFi chipset&#039;s MAC and PHY in order to achieve an indoor location accuracy of 3 feet or better with 90% confidence, yielding an order-of-magnitude accuracy improvement at no additional cost, since WiFi is already a standard feature in most smartphones.",

However, it currently can take hundreds of hours of tedious manual tracing of laser scan or photogrammetry point clouds to create a full 3D model of a single large building. The output of this research will be a fundamental change from current CAD technology that should reduce 3D modeling time by 99%. Automating 3D model creation is a massive mathematical challenge, one that has vexed the CAD/mapping community for decades. Algorithmically accounting for the innumerable geometries of building facades and automatically creating a light-weight, accurate, fully 3D streetscape model has never before been successfully accomplished, according to all published literature. This project should be able to be the first software available that creates fully 3D, centimeter-accurate building models automatically.

The widespread availability of fully 3D city models and streetscapes will have a profound impact on the personal navigation, commercial real estate, design/construction, first responder, security, and defense industries. Although this project is high-risk due to the enormity of the algorithmic challenge, it is high reward with a commercial potential close to one billion dollars. In the A/E market alone, firms spend nearly $800 million per year on manually creating 3D building models. Successful commercialization of this research will reduce those costs by up to 99%.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is focused on improving biofuel fermentation processes by developing phage products designed to inhibit bacteria that reduce biofuel fermentation efficiencies. This product will improve biomass conversion efficiencies in the biorefinery. One of the most significant challenges to commercial biofuel fermentation is the presence of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) that compete for the feedstock, produce undesirable organic acids, and inhibit the growth of the fermentative microorganism. Antibiotics are commonly applied to control LAB, which may lead to the emergence of antibiotic resistant strains. Furthermore, antibiotic residues in distillers grains can lower the value of this important ethanol co-product, further weakening the economics of biofuel production. Despite antibiotic applications, most facilities are still impacted by LAB-associated fermentation upsets, reducing ethanol yields and increasing costs. Ecolyse is proposing to develop an entirely new approach for controlling LAB during fuel ethanol fermentation, based on LAB terminating phage formulations. Phages are natural, highly host-specific bacteriolytic agents. Ecolyse is pioneering the development of phage products designed to mitigate bacterial problems during industrial activities. The dynamics of LAB contamination during biofuel fermentation is particularly well suited for phage-based mitigation. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to develop a product that not only improves biofuel ethanol fermentation efficiencies but will also reduces the non-medical use of antibiotics. Current control practices for LAB contamination in fermentation facilities include rigorous clean in place policies, adjusting physical parameters, and through the application of chemical biocides and antibiotics. Antibiotics are often the most effective control measure. Regulations designed to reduce antibiotic use fail to encourage viable alternatives. Phage formulations could potentially fill this void for a myriad of industrial applications, including biofuel fermentation. While phage products are being developed for medical and agricultural purposes, Ecolyse is unique in seeking industrial targets. An advantage that phage share with antibiotics over chemical biocides is capacity to specifically kill target bacteria without interacting other microorganisms, including the fermentative yeast. In contrast, chemical biocides are much less selective and doses effective against bacteria may adversely modulate yeast growth. Thus, the innovative application of phage to control LAB in the fuel ethanol fermentation industry will lead to both immediate economic and long-term socio/economic impacts. The phage products will be marketed to the almost 200 ethanol fermentation facilities in the U.S. alone.",

Phase IV RFID sensors have been successfully integrated into compression-cast rubber components and have proven mechanical survivability when integrated with a T158 backer pad. Because the read range of passive RFID sensors is necessarily limited, WTTM applies Phase IV sensor chips in a TA measurement suite that wirelessly transmits real-time data to one or more visualization/storage terminals via a ZigBee mesh network. This allows test personnel on or off a full-speed moving vehicle to monitor real-time internal track component temperatures, up to 1000 feet away.

In our innovative solution we generate synthetic data by pulling apart a real data dataset; we put it back together using a number of unique algorithmic methods; and we validate that our synthetic data corresponds to the original data in all key characteristics. Finally, we provide a user interface with advanced visualization tools so that researchers can interact naturally and easily with the algorithms and the synthetic network data.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Sapphire possesses a number of physical properties, including high strength, high melting point, chemical inertness, and excellent transparency in the visible and IR spectrum, which make it an attractive window material for military applications. For Phase I, Rubicon Technology demonstrated a sapphire crystal growth process to MRL 5 capable of growing slabs 20&quot;x 14&quot;.  During Phase II the process will be scaled up and finalized to produce polished sapphire windows 36&quot;x 18&quot;x 0.8&quot;.  All aspects of the process, starting from growth and progressing through slicing, surface grinding, polishing, and characterization will be performed and finalized in order to reach MRL 7.  The needs of the end user, Lockheed Martin, will be considered to ultimately provide a drop-in replacement for the current sapphire windows used in the Joint Strike Fighter Electro-Optical Targeting System.  BENEFIT:  The ability to provide large scale sapphire windows will address new markets where application are currently not serviceable by current products due to limitations in window size and thickness and/or concerns over strength and optical quality of the material. Some specific target markets include commercial aircraft and commercial shipping which will benefit from the enhanced optical qualities as well as enhanced strength of sapphire over conventional materials.  In addition, such windows can be used to protect onboard imaging and targeting systems for the Joint Strike Fighter and RC-135 Cobra Ball.  Furthermore, large sapphire windows can fulfill the need for transparent armor in Army vehicles requiring maximum situational awareness that opaque materials cannot supply.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Optical Physics Company (OPC) demonstrated a technology opportunity for radiation hardened star trackers.  In particular, OPC has been developing an interferometric star tracker (iST) concept under SBIR contracts funded by both the Air Force and the Missile Defense Agency (MDA).  One application of the technology is in faint object detection and tracking.  Additional development is necessary to advance technology maturity to TRL 6 and to transition the technology to a Navy customer.    Current iST technology maturity is TRL 5.  To advance towards TRL 6, OPC is proposing to design, build, test, and deliver a flight ready interferometric faint object tracker (iFOT).   The iFOT design will be based on the device developed for a Navy sponsored SBIR Phase II contract, updated for higher efficiency and enhanced sensitivity.  The flight ready iFOT will be interfaced to a computer for data acquisition allowing for image storage up to the hard drive capacity of the computer.     BENEFIT:  Department of Defense (DoD) space programs need continued development of radiation hardened star tracker technology. Radiation hardened star trackers provide attitude information to the spacecraft after many years in orbit. This is important for long lifetime of DoD space assets, ensuring mission utility by keeping satellites pointed correctly. Star trackers are commercially available; however these are either not radiation hardened or are built outside the United States. Star trackers from outside the US cannot be used on DoD satellites due to regulations. Therefore, AFRL/RV funded several SBIR efforts to build a radiation hardened star tracker in the US.     OPC has been investing in star tracker technology development with the goal of becoming a star tracker device manufacturer.  OPC is building three product lines around the technology.   These product lines are: star trackers for spacecraft GN &amp; C, sensors for ISR missions for tracking dim objects of interest, and GPS Independent Navigation and Guidance on airborne platforms.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  MYMIC is developing the Virtual Control Room (VCoR)  National Transonic Facility (NTF) for NASA Langley. The VCoR-NTF system will support training NTF control room operators, provide a system for capturing NASA knowledge, and provide an environment for expert control room operators to practice their skills. During the development process, MYMIC will construct an Initial Operating Capability (IOC) VCoR to support capturing NTF procedures and formatting them for training. In addition, the Team will develop a training management structure to provide NASA the ability to capture expert knowledge and provide the knowledge to new control room operators in a single format and from a single location. The development during the construction of the IOC will result in a VCoR system capable of supporting future NTF procedure development.  BENEFIT:  The VCoR-NTF system will benefit NASA by reducing the cost to train control room operators and by providing a single environment to capture and store expert knowledge. Currently NTF control room training requires between 18 and 24 months, and training can only occur during live runs of the NTF tunnel. By incorporating the VCoR-NTF system, NASA will reduce the time and overhead required to train by providing training opportunities outside live tunnel runs and by providing a 24/7 source of training. In addition, the VCoR-NTF system will allow NASA to prepare new operators to deal with hazardous situations, something they can only currently practice if a hazardous event arises during live runs.     In addition to the benefits VCoR provides to training, the system will also provide a capability for NASA to capture expert knowledge that may otherwise be lost. As NASA begins to face an increasing need to reduce costs while maintaining capabilities, the need to capture expert knowledge and more effectively relay the information to new users, the VCoR system will support this capability sustainment. The knowledge capture and presentation will allow NASA to cross-train personnel, increasing the number of individuals who can support operations, and helping reduce the impact of personnel lost to cost cuts and retirement.    Outside of NASA, the VCoR system is applicable to all control room settings. While the current system has a virtual environment which mimics a wind tunnel control room, the underlying system construct is applicable to all control room settings. This will allow MYMIC to take the VCoR system to markets outside the wind tunnel application and with minimal modification, provide these control rooms with the same powerful training platform.    From a commercialization perspective, MYMIC proposes to introduce VCoR throughout the NASA facilities at LaRC (Langley Research Center) where this effort is being deployed. Furthermore, while conducting VCoR reviews with the ATP (Aeronautics Test Program) personnel from Glenn Research Center, the AEDC (Arnold Engineering Development Complex) and AMES Research Center; MYMIC discovered that needs exist at these locations for VCoR type training. MYMIC&quot;s first meeting outside of LaRC is scheduled for October 24, 2012 at Glenn Research Center.     MYMIC foresees additional commercialization opportunities throughout all of NASA as well as private industry where Wind Tunnels are utilized. For example, MYMIC intends to approach the Boeing facilities in Seattle, WA; Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, FL; the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, GA; and other wind tunnels throughout the United States and beyond.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The importance of precise satellite navigation is being realized throughout the world. In fact several systems are being deployed. Collectively these systems form the GNSS which offers improved accuracy and satellite availability. However due to differing requirements, new GNSS receivers are being developed. As a result, a GNSS antenna must be developed as well.    The design of a GNSS antenna however is not a simple modification to existing GPS antenna technologies. Wider bandwidth and multipath signal suppression requirements increase the complexity of the design. As such, a unique combination of circularly polarized spiral antenna and ground plane with diffraction suppression technologies is being developed to accomplish this goal.    During this program a GNSS antenna prototype shall be designed, fabricated and tested to demonstrate feasibility and functionality. A comprehensive set of RF tests including gain pattern and S-parameter measurements shall be performed and reported. This approach is expected to provide uniform maximum RCHP gain above horizon, low LHCP cross polarization in all directions, and minimum backlobe gain below horizon. A steep roll off in gain is also anticipated near horizon. Physically the antenna can be realized in a compact durable package. Furthermore, cost effective materials and processes are employed wherever possible.    BENEFIT:  Worldwide use of the GNSS is expected to be prolific. Just as the current GPS has grown in popularity throughout the commercial sector so too shall the GNSS. The two big advantages of the GNSS are improved accuracy and superior satellite availability. With an increasing global economy the world is becoming a smaller place whereby business and travel abroad are more commonplace than ever. As such, this new capability is even more desirable.    As the need for GNSS grows, so does the need for GNSS receiver antennas. In fact, GNSS can be expected to be utilized in a variety of environments including land, sea and air. Because antennas must be strategically located without obstruction, often they must be amenable to unusual environmental conditions and volumetric envelope constraints. The push for a compact GNSS antenna package feeds right into such demands. And because there are many possible vehicles, structures, or even personnel whereby these receivers may end up, the variations in GNSS antenna configurations can be quite significant.    Since commercialization is a very real opportunity, it is imperative to focus on the objectives described above. In a nutshell, the antenna must be designed to be functional, compact, and lightweight, as well as inexpensive in terms of materials and manufacturing. If these criteria can be met, then the potential for this technology is substantial for years to come.",

        "abstract": "The move to more-electric architectures during the past decade in military and commercial airborne systems continues to increase the complexity of designing and specifying the electric power system (EPS). The addition of numerous high-power electric loads has drastically altered the dynamics of power flow on the electrical bus. Many of these loads often exhibit peak-to-average power ratios in excess of 5-to-1 for brief periods of time (50-5000 ms). In addition to this high peak-power, some of the loads can produce regenerative power flow equal to their peak power draw for brief periods of time (typically 20-200 ms). In addition to the ever increasing dynamics of electrical loads in the modern fighter, the move to electrify more systems has increased the criticality of the EPS leading to increased need for redundant and configurable systems. In the modern fighter, the resulting reliability requirements have led to EPS architectures wherein multiple sources exist within the aircraft that are dynamically taken in or out of the EPS based upon the failure status of a variety of components. Such reconfiguration is practical in large part due to the aircraft capability to adjust power requirements in response to source limitations by adjusting the performance capabilities of the platform.  As the reconfigurability of the EPS, the number of available sources, and the number, complexity, and criticality of system loads continue to increase, several interesting questions arise regarding the design and validation of the EPS including:  1) Will the proposed EPS architecture be stable under all possible configurations of system loads? 2) Does the architecture optimally utilize the variety of source capabilities that exist throughout the aircraft? 3) How does one analyze and design such complex integrated EPS architectures to ensure the desired outcome?  In the Phase I effort, PCKA developed an analysis approach capable of answering these questions in the context of MEA EPSs. Further, PCKA developed and demonstrated a coordinated source control algorithms capable of enabling optimal source utilization within the EPS at any given time. Finally, PCKA developed metrics capable of providing estimation of large-displacement stability margin similar to the gain and phase margin traditionally utilized in small-signal analysis.  In this Phase II proposal, PCKA outlines a strategy to continue the development of the analysis techniques and tools developed in the Phase I effort, validate these tools through appropriate testing with detailed simulation and hardware testing, and further refine the technology through application to current NAVAIR programs and platforms.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The decomposition of hydroxylammonium nitrate (HAN)-based monopropellants is a complex process that involves scores of unimolecular and bimolecular reaction steps and dozens of species. Chemical reactions between these species and the catalyst, as well as thermal effects, can all have a profound impact on the life of the catalyst. In Phase I, Ultramet performed rigorous heat, mass, and momentum balances to develop a model that describes the transient temperature and chemical composition profiles that result when AF-M315E monopropellant is decomposed in a packed bed of either catalytic or non-catalytic material. The model predictions, which agree well with empirical data, were used to predict the iridium recession rate throughout the bed. In Phase II, Ultramet will use ab initio data to better model the decomposition pathways of hydroxyethylhydrazinium nitrate (HEHN) (as reliable data already exist for HAN) via finite rate kinetics, the overall model for the ignition system will be refined, and key pieces of empirical data will be obtained for anchoring the model and verifying its predictions. As was the case in the Phase I model, the effects of chamber pressure, bed loading, propellant composition, bed preheat temperature, and the nature of the bed packing (catalytic or non-catalytic) will all be taken into account. Each of these variables will be investigated empirically to isolate their effect and to anchor that specific element of the model. The result will be a model that can predict engine performance over an extremely wide parameter space. Equally as important, it will also predict the thermochemical environment at any location within the bed as a function of time, thus providing key information on the various environments that the ignition system materials, the bed plate, and the chamber itself will need to endure.  BENEFIT:  Being able to predict the temperature and chemical composition of HAN-based monopropellant decomposition products at any location in a thruster will enable catalysts, combustion chambers, and bed plates to all be designed more rigorously and rely less on trial-and-error empiricism. This will greatly accelerate the implementation of HAN-based thrusters in both military and commercial applications. Military applications include reaction control systems for launch vehicles, attitude control systems and main engines for satellites, and divert and attitude control systems for missiles and missile defense systems. Commercial applications include similar launch vehicle and satellite applications, as well as main engines and attitude control systems for interplanetary spacecraft and sample return missions.",

        "abstract": "The primary objective of this effort is to further develop and validate a computational capability which can be used to assess propulsion systems for compliance with insensitive munitions (IM) requirements. Comprehensive testing to ascertain IM compliance for such systems is time consuming and expensive, but necessitated by safety, transportation, and deployment concerns. Sub-scale testing requirements and screening tools have been developed in an attempt to reduce the time and expense of deploying these systems. However, despite the clear advantages these approaches offer, the effects of scaling and full system configuration influences are extraordinarily difficult to predict and account for in these sub-scale testing scenarios. Thus, it is not always possible to directly ascertain compliance with IM requirements based on the results of these tests. A theoretically-comprehensive computational tool, once calibrated using laboratory-scale testing and validated against material performance databases, has the potential to predict the performance during IM compliance testing using sub-scale behavior and screening test results. Building upon currently existing sub-scale testing, providing an analytical understanding of the results through a computational framework and extrapolating that assessment to predict full-scale behavior would drastically reduce testing requirements and overall cost while accelerating the qualification of the new propellants and systems.",

The frequency range of operation is in the E-band (71-76 GHz). The TWTA will be suitable for use in satellite communications. The utilization of innovative CNT cathodes will allow the exploitation of a broad spectrum, 5GHz, available in the millimeter wavelengths for high data rate battlefield communications. Thus, it will be possible to obtain satellite communications uplinks that will operate at multi-gigabit per second data rates and well understood weather attenuation factors, such as rain fade. In such a way, link budgets would be effectively realized. The CNT cathode was fabricated and tested in Phase I, and the design of the TWTA was generated and numerically modeled.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  AuraSense is developing and commercializing NanoFlare technology as an enabling tool for detecting RNA levels in cells. Current methods for sensing of viral exposure require great amounts of virus particles to be present in blood, or extensive processing of blood to isolate virus-specific genomic markers. We will develop NanoFlare sensors that can penetrate through skin, enter the bloodstream and detect viral targets. Once inside blood cells, the sensors will signal the presence of virus-specific genomic markers. This signal can be detected by fluorescence spectroscopy. The flexibility of the NanoFlare platform will facilitate the tailoring of the NanoFlare to meet current and emerging threats.  BENEFIT:  AuraSense will demonstrate an approach for detection of viral RNA in living cells. This will be accomplished using non-invasive systemic delivery through the skin.  NanoFlare technology could thus be adapted for field deployment, for example by creating a patch to systemically deliver NanoFlares.   We envision that a NanoFlare patch could be used by the warfighter to determine viral infection by taking a finger prick blood sample, with a rapid readout using a simple fluorescence detector such as a UV light source. In the commercial space, such a point-of-care fluorescence detection can be used by doctors in the clinic for rapid PCR-free diagnostic assays.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The use of a distributed electronics interface in air vehicles offers many highly sought benefits but remains conceptual due to the fact that rugged electronic components capable of reliable operation in high temperature 225C environments are currently not readily available.  In Phase II Orbital Research will develop a distributed architecture for turbine engine controls based on affordable high temperature electronics (HTE).  This will be accomplished by building on the work done in Phase I where we analyzed I/O needs of two (2) FADECs and correlated those needs with several protocol standards.  The protocol standard chosen by industry for distributed control of FADEC I/O interfaces will require high temperature components for the physical layer, which will be developed and prototyped by Orbital Research during Phase II.  Orbital will apply its significant experience in designing and developing HTE to producing HTE communications ASICs, and integrating them into a Multi-Chip Module, and subsequently testing the system.  All aspects of development will be conducted in close working relationships with the major FADEC and turbine engine manufacturers to assure practicality of the final configuration.    BENEFIT:  Military Market.  The technology developed in Phases II (and III) of this project will provide the many benefits of distributed control in turbine engines and eliminate the current major constraints associated with the thermal environments surrounding engine systems.  This technology promises many applications for the military market, including advanced engine and flight controls, unmanned aerial vehicles, directed energy systems, military control units, actuators, and more-electric systems.  Civilian Market.  Projected applications for the developed temperature-tolerant control technology in the civilian sector are equally attractive and include commercial aircraft, automotive, ground-based power generation, oil industry, and harsh industrial processing applications.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Perfect point EDM Corporation has developed a patented technology that is commercially available for aircraft fastener removal known as the edrill system. The unique device is a handheld Electro-Discharge Machining (EDM) unit. The handpiece is similar in size to a small conventional drill motor.  Using a tubular electrode the edrill cuts through even the hardest metals at a rate unmatched by conventional drilling techniques. A typical cut through a Titanium fastener (nominal 1/4&quot;size) is about 13 seconds with no more pressure required than to contain the dielectric water used in the process, greatly reducing operator fatigue. Unlike conventional drilling, the edrill leaves no residual heat or debris.  It has become evident that the edrill is just as valuable in hole drilling operations in hard alloys used in aircraft construction. A particular problem area in aircraft manufacturing is composite stack materials. Conventional drilling is extremely difficult in metal / Carbon Fiber Resin Process (CRFP) stacks and has potential for damaging the CRFP material. In Phase I Perfect Point demonstrated a process that minimizes the potential damage risks while reducing operator effort and increasing efficiency. Phase II will allow development of a system prototype suitable for manufacturing integration.    BENEFIT:  The resulting technological advances may be commercialized in the form of tools to be used in the airplane manufacturing process that could result in a significant reduction of manufacturing costs. The commercial product(s) would be of interest to any manufacturer of commercial or military aircraft in which thick, exotic, multiple material stacks (including mixes of composite and metal) are used.",

        "abstract": "An innovative approach for incorporating the coupled interaction between a ship airwake and rotor downwash in real-time dynamic interface simulations is proposed. The approach employs a database of high-fidelity ship-alone and coupled rotor-ship airwake CFD simulations to train an artificial neural network (ANN) based model of the recirculation effects due to the rotor downwash interaction with ship structures. Once trained, the ANN model will provides a real-time correction factor to the rotor inflow velocities used by the rotor model in the flight simulation. The ANN model thus provides a portable, fast-running, plug-in model to the flight simulator that will work with the current rotor and airwake models employed in the NAVAIR Manned Flight Simulator (MFS).  The Phase I effort successfully demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed approach for a well defined, limited range of inputs. The will be expanded in Phase II to encompass a larger database of simulations, expanding the applicability of the model to all relative positions between the rotorcraft and ship and a range of ship wind-over-deck conditions. The model will be implemented and evaluated in the MFS flight simulation environment.",

CSM enhances WNW&#039;s frequency decision algorithms to include interference, traffic loading and topology information. The frequency selection algorithms from DSA, WNW, and CSM point of view must be evaluated to ensure the network remains stable, avoids interference, and efficiently uses available spectrum. In addition to channel interference, network topology is also factored in to and impacted by decisions taken by DSA, WNW, and CSM. Therefore another technical problem is ensuring that network topology remains stable and optimal in dynamic RF conditions with multiple adaptive technologies.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  In Phase II, Ridgetop Group will develop a high-performance radiation-hardened ADC suitable for use in satellite communication (SATCOM) systems where radiation exposure would otherwise degrade performance. This proposal responds to Air Force topic AF103-092, with the objective of designing a radiation-hardened, high speed (2 GSPS) analog-to-digital data converter (ADC) with high bit precision for use in low bit error rate (BER) 16-quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) demodulator applications. The significance of this innovation is that high speed and high performance communication systems, incorporating QAM demodulator subsystems, require digitization with extremely high linearity and dynamic range to achieve system performance targets. With the added requirement of radiation hardness, the ADC is a critical chokepoint that must meet demanding standards. Accordingly, Ridgetop&quot;s ADC will be highly linear with an INL and DNL of no more than 0.5 LSB, a flat gain of&lt;0.1 dB, a channel-to-channel isolation of&gt;80 dB, an operating temperature range of at least -40 to 80  degrees C, a very high effective number of bits (ENOB) of 11, and a TID tolerance better than 300 krad(Si).   The proposed ADC can be used as an integral part of Air Force&quot;s SATCOM low BER, 16 QAM demodulator applications. Ridgetop&quot;s ADC is much more suitable for this purpose than currently commercially available ADCs due to its high radiation hardness and significant performance improvement compared to the radiation-hardened ADCs that are commercially available.     BENEFIT:  Precision data converters are critical to the performance of high-speed digital signal processing (DSP) systems. The sampling rate and resolution of the converters define the performance aspects of the entire system. Because of its aggressive 2 GSPS sampling rate, high ENOB (11 bits), and low power dissipation (720 mW), this ADC overcomes a significant barrier to higher performance communications systems.   Ridgetop&quot;s innovative time-interleaved silicon germanium (SiGe)-based ADC will improve the resolution, linearity, power consumption and radiation hardness of current state-of-the art ADCs used in advanced communication systems. As a modular, self-contained building block from a popular trusted foundry, this ADC will become an important library element in future system designs.  High-performance ADCs are widely used in satellite communication systems, space-based radar applications, medical imaging devices, software-defined radio applications, linear power amplifiers, high-speed data acquisition applications, high-speed test and instrumentation equipment, and high-speed digital signal processing (DSP) systems.",

The objective of this effort is to develop, validate and demonstrate a multiscale computational model of nano effects on major human organs. The Phase I effort has successfully established proof-of-concept and demonstrated a fundamental biophysics, physiology and biology based software tool for modeling NP deposition in the respiratory track and NP s-induced toxic responses.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Modern electronics used for military space communications are susceptible to highly energized charged particles such as electrons and protons originating from coronal mass ejections that create geomagnetic storms.  There is a need for advanced protection measures that can help minimize the impact to space electronics caused by current surges during these severe solar storms. Although optical monitoring of the sun can predict the onset of severe space weather conditions, determining the details of the conditions often requires on-board satellite sensors.  Knowledge of not only the dose and dose rate, but the specific radiation type, can allow for a better assessment and mitigation of particular radiation damage effects observed for on-board electronics.  Existing compact charged-particle detectors for satellites, such as the Teledyne Micro-dosimeter, provide dose and dose rate information; however, these devices do not discriminate between electron and proton events, do not provide spectroscopic information, and may have a limited radiation tolerance.    The proposed solution involves expanding on Phase I results for coupling Diphenylanthracene (DPA) with a solid-state photomultiplier (SSPM) photodetector and developing the complementary readout circuitry required to detect/discriminate fast electrons from protons while providing dose and dose rate information characteristic of solar events over a wide range of energies.    BENEFIT:  During space flight, both the immediate dose rate and total exposure information can be recorded simultaneously by these high efficiency digital dosimeters.  The compact size and inexpensive nature of these sensors also opens the possibility of monitoring many areas for comparison of radiation exposure, including individual monitors for each satellite, even for the emerging, smaller, next-generation designs.  Ground-based research and comparisons will also become easier and less expensive with the SSPM dosimeter.  Inexpensive radiation dosimeters are in general demand for commercial applications, such as personnel or waste monitoring; other applications include border monitoring for homeland security and protecting satellites and ground-based equipment from solar flares.  The ability to inexpensively mass-produce these devices creates an entirely new market for arrays of distributed sensors.",

Furthermore, their use is dominated by a paradigm of control in which a highly trained operator is giving very precise, low-level commands to a UAS. As UAS become more autonomous, they will require less control, but will instead require input from a range of users, including high-level directions or other kinds of mission-relevant information. However, current operator control units (OCUs) are stuck in the paradigm of explicit control. To take advantage of increasing autonomy and to broaden access to a wider range of users, new kinds of robust natural interfaces, including multiple modes of input and output, must be developed that allow users with various skill levels to interact with UAS in a variety of environments. SoarTech proposes to leverage our prior work on a multi-modal interfaces for interacting with autonomous systems. We will extend this work to the VTOL UAS domain, making it robust to a range of user skill levels and experience, including multiple redundant forms of input and output that are appropriate to a range of environments in which forward deployed units need to interact with autonomous UAS.",

        "abstract": "The increasing availability of small unmanned aerial systems (SUAS) leads to the possibility of forming temporary mission-centric networks using multiple SUASs.  The major problems faced in achieving this vision, specifically the dynamic nature of SUAS topologies and the limited bandwidth available, combine to create an environment that is inhospitable for traditional routing approaches.  In Phase I, we designed and implemented a prototype of SURENET including SUAS-compatible link metrics and topology dissemination techniques.  Using IAI&quot;s RFnest wireless network emulation hardware, this prototype was evaluated in Phase I on actual wireless radios using both replayed CUNE field test data and a representative scenario.  Beyond showing the potentially significant improvement in throughput and route availability provided by SURENET, these early evaluations in a highly realistic network environment allowed us to identify and design several important enhancements to the link metrics and topology management.  We will also implementation queuing behaviors and techniques to use additional information available to the network.  We will also create a set of detailed, representative evaluation scenarios more closely derived from CUNE data sets and conduct two incremental development and evaluation spirals.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  On-orbit satellite characterization is critically important for space situational awareness (SSA).  Determining attitude, configuration, and even identification can be challenging despite numerous sensing capabilities to provide information.  Better access and extrapolation of ground-truth data (captured pre-launch) are proving to be useful for on-orbit assessment.  The Satellite Ground-truth Information Fusion (SatGIF) is a knowledge management system that will provide innovative data visualizations and displays that support the analysts mental processes and investigatory methods, providing decision aids and alerting capabilities to increase SSA. Currently the effort is focused on assisting AFRL researchers and scientists to improve the capabilities of current systems and demonstrate the value of these capabilities to the operational community. By making baseline data more accessible and meaningful across a wider range of expertise, analysts will have higher confidence in their characterization tasks.  BENEFIT:  The result of this Phase II effort will provide a knowledge management system that supports visual reasoning in the characterization of satellites.  A key functionality will be the leveraging of ground truth and modeling/simulation data to support the management of uncertainty in making determinations of satellite characterization.  These techniques, along with the innovative visual reasoning interface that will be designed to facilitate interaction, will prove valuable in other domains in need of information fusion and uncertainty management. SatGIF will further Aptimas objectives in developing models that support decision making and address uncertainty inherent in real world domains. SatGIF will extend several of our innovative projects applying statistical modeling and decision support methods to meet a range of needs in government and commercial markets. With each new project, our knowledge of relevant techniques and research is furthered, promoting the generation of new and innovative ideas.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Advanced Li battery technology remains beset with performance deficiencies at low/high temperatures/extreme environments (high vacuum, radiation, vibration/shock),  primarily from poor conductivity/mobility in organic electrolytes used under such conditions. In this respect, electrolytes using ionic liquids, with large liquidus ranges, no vapor pressure, non-flammability, have been much studied recently, but remain unviable. Now in entirely unrelated work, in electrochromics for spacecraft thermal control operating at -80 to +100 C, this firm developed unique ionic liquids with very high conductivity and ion mobility at low temperatures and space durability. Phase I work further modified these electrolytes specifically for reentry vehicle Li batteries. Performance demonstrated included: Specific energy&gt;339 Wh/kg at low (-40 C), room, high (+60 C) temperature;&gt;85% capacity retention in multiple cycles;  reversible capacity&gt;145 mAh/g. The key/most important component of the new, reentry-vehicle Li battery, the electrolyte, was successfully arrived at. Phase II work will focus on: Refinement  of other battery components compatible with this electrolyte, including correct anodes/cathodes;  packaging suitable for reentry vehicles; further increase in performance (specific energy, capacity, peak specific power, etc.); extensive testing in reentry vehicle conditions (long-term dormancy, high-g/radiation). Commercial tie-ups with several Li battery manufacturers have been initiated, will be pursued.  BENEFIT:  The resulting wide-operating-temperature Li battery technology may be considered a breakthrough. Applications will be in all extreme-temperature environments where conventional Li battery (including Li ion and polymer electrolyte) technology is unable to function. Military applications would be as original equipment in military vehicles and portable field-use power sources for extreme environments. The larger commercial market, would include, e.g., laptops, cell phones or tablet computers for field use applications in extreme cold or hot. Potential extensions include hybrid and electric vehicles and recreational equipment. A recent, authoritative study estimates the Li ion battery market, using existing technology, at ca. $8b/year by 2015.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Toyon Research Corporation&quot;s 8&quot;Phase I controlled reception pattern array (CRPA) is matched across the entire upper and lower frequency bands of the global navigation satellite systems (GNSS). The array consists of one centrally located element and six tilted surrounding elements. The tilted elements add vertical aperture to the array allowing for excellent cross polarization rejection and 360 degree nulling at fixed elevation angles. Toyon will continue to reduce the size and weight of the array in Phase II by miniaturizing the array elements, adjusting the tilt of the elements, and experimenting with alternative materials. Toyon will perform a market analysis on the emerging GNSS programs in the DoD to get an indication as to what form factor of antennas are required. Two potential programs to which this technology can be applied include The NAVWAR Trinity (TNT) and Joint Precision Approach and Landing System (JPALS). Toyon will fabricate two CRPAs of different size in Phase II, and the size of the arrays shall be dictated by the results of our market analysis. The two different size arrays will be designed for flight and two rugged prototypes of each will be delivered to the Air Force for evaluation.  BENEFIT:  Toyon will fabricate and deliver two different rugged GNSS CRPAs by the end of the Phase II contract. This will benefit the DoD and Toyon since arrays of various size will be available to government agencies and commercial prime contractors as demos. Toyon&quot;s approach will maximize our chances of commercial success by being able to market our technology to a range of platforms.",

        "abstract": "Widely proliferated sea mines present difficult challenges to the Navys ability to guarantee assured access to critical regions. To counter these asymmetric threats, airborne LIDAR systems are being used, but early LIDAR sensor systems have had problems in terms of availability, cost, reliably, and performance. These deficiencies have delayed deployment and driven up costs.  To reduce deployment time and to reduce the cost of future and planned mine countermeasure (MCM) systems, needed are LIDAR sensor components with known performance. To address this need, a waveform sampling LIDAR readout integrated circuit (ROIC) will be developed. Each unit cell of the two-dimensional ROIC will include a high-bandwidth, low-noise preamplifier, a surface return detection circuit, and a waveform sampling circuit.  In the Phase II Base program, the specifications of the ROIC will be updated, the unit cell design will be finalized, and the ROIC, including serial programming interface, digital controllers, on-chip biasing, and analog readout circuits will be designed, simulated, layed out, verified, and then taped out.  In the Phase II Option program, the ROIC will be fabricated and functionally tested, before the ROIC is hybridized to a prototype silicon detector array, and its performance demonstrated against optical signals resembling real world threats.",

        "abstract": "The complexities and challenges in today&quot;s counterinsurgency (COIN) environment require warfighters to constantly learn and adapt to new social systems and networks, shifting alliances, and uncertain host-nation support. Understanding these dynamics requires the collection and analysis of nontraditional types of intelligence, which often take a qualitative or non-numeric form such as interview transcripts, drawings, photographs, and videos. Conventional Geographic Information Systems fail to express qualitative concepts that are not explicitly spatial and that do not fit nicely into the concrete points, lines, and polygons of a Cartesian framework. Since current Geographical Information Systems (GIS) are designed for quantitative data analysis and visualization, the proliferation of qualitative products brings a new set of challenges to the Army intelligence community. Securboration is developing the Stability and Reconstruction GIS (STARGIS) to apply Qualitative GIS principles and provide the warfighter with unprecedented knowledge regarding socio-cultural terrain. As a result, the warfighter will have new situational awareness with respect to deeply held socio-cultural beliefs and customs, reactions to events, and changing attitudes with respect to the indigenous government, insurgents, and external actors.",

Our computational simulations conducted in phase I project have demonstrated that significant acoustic attenuation can be achieved in desired frequency ranges (band gaps) using novel structures of perforated, membrane based and solid inclusion materials. In phase II we propose to adapt our multiphysics computational software as CAD tools for AMMs and use them to design optimized structures and HPD devices that achieve more than 12 dB attenuation at high audible frequencies (&gt;3 kHz) and low attenuation (&lt;1 dB) at frequencies low frequencies (&lt;1 kHz). The main goal is to establish robust fabrication processes of selected classes of AMMs and their packaging into suitable HPDs. Several samples of AMMs will be fabricated and tested in laboratory experiments using both acoustic and shock wave fields. Prototype HPDs will be tested using human head and ear phantoms for military environment acoustic signatures such as helicopter cabin, aircraft carrier deck, rifle range, breachers test etc. In a partnership with US industrial manufactures we will fabricate a batch of devices suitable for human and field testing.",

        "abstract": "Proposed is a full scale, production-ready prototype of a solar-powered system for producing hot water (SHW) to support Army Forward Operating Bases. The approach is innovative in that the system collects and stores energy in the form of high quality heat rather than hot water. It provides on-demand hot water in a manner akin to commercial tank-less hot water heaters. The system is comprised of 12 identical, independently operating units, each of which can collect 250,000 BTU/day, which in the aggregate meets the requirements for a 150 soldier Forward Operating Base.  Six of these units can be packed into a single TRICON.  The system design assures that there is no single point of failure.     One potential advantage of this approach is that the basic system can also become a standard platform, with most parts interchangeable, for fulfilling many base energy requirements, such as electrical power generation and steam for thermal desalination systems and for field hospitals.

The PAWS approach anchors innovative kinetic modeling of detailed signature mechanisms to high-level computations and flight and laboratory observations. In Phase I we successfully demonstrated the approach by developing prototype PAWS modules, integrating them into the MDA SOCRATES-P/FLITES signature codes, and validating them against field data in the long-wave infrared (LWIR). In Phase II, PAWS will be extended to model signatures from 0.4-14 microns for a large set of propulsion systems and flow regimes.

CYTAN will be implemented as configurable, policy-based software plugins, each of which addresses a specific set of cyber threats.

The use of unicellular organisms in cell-based detection systems is particularly advantageous both because these organisms have developed a natural ability to respond to environmental changes, and because several methods for long-term storage with minimal maintenance requirements have been established and tested.  Long-term storage of packaged freeze-dried cells with no need for significant environmental controls such as temperature eliminates limitations in the development of a rugged field-deployable device perfectly adapted to logistical requirements in a military setting.  The need for a toxicant of interest to cross the natural barriers such as cell walls or membranes is perhaps the only significant limitation to the detection capability of any cell-based system.  This will be addressed as part of the proposed effort by testing known genetic and biochemical approaches to the permeabilization of the bacterial cell wall to develop novel biosensors with broader and more sensitive detection capabilities.

While it is well known that laser sources in the blue/green spectral region increase the achievable range in ocean and coastal environments, only recently have researchers been able to show that the use of RF modulated macro-pulses combined with RF coherent detection can lead to an increase in system sensitivity and target contrast. The increased contrast between target and backscattered signal results because the modulated component of the backscattered signal is significantly reduced due to the random distribution of the scattering elements in a turbid media.

Existing search mechanisms based on keyword indexing is ineffective at ranking relevance and inefficient when applied to the volume of data in the AFRL/RYA electronic Body of Knowledge (eBoK).     SST will be based on a novel semantics-based search mechanism that overlays data stored in structured and unstructured formats onto a well-defined ontology that ties together concepts and specific instances, exposing find higher order relationships among diverse data. SST will facilitate reuse and collaboration by providing users with search results that are more relevant and include deeper relationships.    BENEFIT:  The need for SST capability has become apparent through AFRL&quot;s focus on investment management, knowledge management, and program portfolio management.  Each facility within AFRL has taken a different approach to storing and sharing its intellectual capital (IC) - the studies, findings, data, reports, articles, and research summaries created during the research and development process.  To optimize these investments, AFRL requires a search and index capability that goes beyond keyword search to provide context and relevance to search results.

Two centrifuge rotor platforms are capable of applying 0\u00962 g's to the modular specimen containers which can be modified to accommodate a wide variety of experiment samples.  Curved cell culture specimen containers are designed to maintain a constant radius (within ? 1 mm) without inertial-gradient shearing or significant Coriolis acceleration.

The Phase II base effort develops the prototype camera appropriate for integration in a Photonics Mast Head, and the option effort starts the integration and testing. The proposed effort represents an extension of Surface Optics 20 years experience in multispectral and hyperspectral imager design, and in ultra-high dynamic range imagers. By building on Surface Optics Corporations experience in imaging system development, sensor development, and algorithm development, the proposed program will produce a new ultra-high dynamic range high-definition color camera.",

The preliminary design of the HYSPOT acoustic tile has been successfully simulated with FEA models, fabricated, and tested under various laboratory conditions, showing noise reduction of&gt;20 dB in SPL re 20 uPa, which is equivalent to reducing the noise at a busy roadside to conversational level, 1 m away. In Phase II (Base and Option), POC will optimize the HYSPOT configuration, hardware, and software to produce a fully functional HYSPOT system prototype; POC plans to develop a HYSPOT prototype and experimental rig to examine the effectiveness of noise isolation and vibration and to test that prototype in the Huntington Ingalls Industries FlexLab mock-up aircraft carrier.",

To develop a cost effective training solution for all such devices, the ability to start with one central, core solution is highly desirable. A Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), capable of real-time operation can provide such a platform, providing programmable interconnection of various vehicle component models (engine, aerodynamics, control systems, human interface, etc.) along with predefined interfaces for each required model. Differing models of the same system functions can then be interchanged without affecting other elements or the programmable core software. Users can thus retain intellectual property or security of sensitive models by integrating executable code to the SOA through the use of the predefined interfaces, or they can modify the interfaces necessary and define new revision module interfaces as required.

InnovaPrep is developing a novel membrane-based fractionation and\nconcentration system capable of removing inhibitors and separating whole pathogens and exogenous materials into two highly-concentrated volumes.\nThe proposed system will be exceedingly rapid; with the capability to fractionate, prepare, and concentrate 10 milliliter environmental aerosol samples\n(without sample splitting) into 100 microliter volumes in less than 15 minutes, and deliver the samples ready for identification.

Demand for this capability will be found in the government and at major airframe manufacturers.   Phase II development will result in a commercial CTS components that satisfy this demand.  Combination of unsteady loads data collected with these developments with advanced trajectory simulation capabilities will allow engineers to accurately and rapidly predict store separation trajectories in order to avoid unpleasant&quot;surprises&quot;during development, testing, and service.  Initial implementation will focus on store load measurement, however the capability created will apply to other systems subjected to unsteady loading environments.

        "abstract": "Intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) has become an essential need for the U.S. Warfighter. In support of this need, the use of autonomous vehicles has grown considerably over the past decade. In particular, the use of small unmanned ground vehicles (SUGV) has proven to be invaluable as they minimize a Soldiers exposure to hazards while providing critical, non-line-of-sight intelligence. Many current autonomous vehicles including SUGVs utilize rechargeable lithium-ion batteries for on-board power to meet the vehicles portability (i.e., lightweight) and stealth operation requirements. However, the low specific power and energy of current state-of-the-art (SOTA) lithium-ion imposes a major constraint and challenge to current and future Warfighter operations by limiting the operational performance of these vehicles. As such, the U.S. Army has considerable interest in developing rechargeable lithium-ion batteries that possess both increased energy and power per unit mass. To address this need, ADA Technologies, Inc. proposes a program to increase the power and energy in lithium-ion battery cells through a combination of reduced internal resistance and increased cell voltage. The proposed Phase I program will establish material synthesis protocols, material scale-up, proof-of-concept cell production and demonstration and ultimately design and produce a full-scale.",

Bottoming cycles, such as organic Rankine cycles, can utilize this waste heat to produce useful work, improving overall efficiency by 10 to 20%. An enabling technology for utilizing a bottoming cycle is an Exhaust Heat Recovery Heat Exchanger (EHRX) which transfers heat from the gas turbine exhaust to the working fluid of the bottoming cycle. For marine applications, this heat exchanger experiences large temperature transients and gradients, and is exposed to a corrosive exhaust stream. These environmental factors make long lifetimes and durability key challenges. On this program, we propose to develop an innovative and robust EHRX that is optimized for marine applications.

Specifically, the inspection entails the detection of cracks on the edge of the hole next to the nut plate. The system would be small, light-weight, easy to use, and significantly outperform currently available techniques. In Phase I of the program JENTEK demonstrated the feasibility of the MWM Array technology to meet the Air Force&quot;s target detection requirement using EDM notched specimens. In Phase II JENTEK will work with the Air Force to select a specific bolt-hole application and draft a Master Requirements Document for the implementation of the proposed inspection using JENTEK&quot;s MWM Array technology and commercial GridStation HandHeld System. Implementation will require adaptation of a prototype bolt-hole scanner, mandrels, and sensors for the target application. After testing the integrated system, a preliminary POD study will be performed per the guidelines provided in MIL HDBK-1823A to determine the detection capability. A transition plan with cost-benefit analysis will be provided to the Air Force for implementation of the system. Finally, the system capability will be demonstrated on components at an Air Force facility.  BENEFIT:  If this program is successful, JENTEK will deliver to the Air Force an inspection system for bolt holes with attached nut plates capable of detecting edge cracks that are smaller than those detectable using conventional inspection techniques. The system will use a prototype bolt-hole scanning fixture, mandrels and sensors adapted for the targeted application and JENTEK&quot;s commercial GridStation HandHeld instrument. With the ability to detect significantly smaller cracks, the Air Force will be able to utilize more proactive maintenance techniques and significantly lengthen the useful life of the inspected components.",

        "abstract": "To address the OSD&quot;s need for a quiet, maintenance-free, high torque density magnetic gearbox, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to advance the development of the Axial Magnetic TRANsmission (AMTRAN) shown feasible in Phase I. The new magnetic gearbox design, AMTRAN is based on mechanomagnetics, magnetic coupling, and kinematics. The unique kinetic design and configuration of the permanent magnets in AMTRAN enable the high gear ratio and high torque conversion needed for different actuation and propulsion systems. As a result, the AMTRAN offers a magnetic gearbox that directly addresses the needs of several DoD agencies to increase service availability, particularly for mission-critical applications, and reduce the acoustic noisea critical factor in covert naval operations. In Phase I, POC successfully demonstrated the feasibility of the AMTRAN gear by simulation, material analysis and research, and building a working prototype of a scalable magnetic gear with gear ratio of 17.5:1. Based on the Phase I successes, in Phase II POC will fabricate an enhanced gear prototype and further optimize the design based on additional objective metrics such as vibration, torque ripple, overall cost, reliability, and form factor, and perform business case analysis, including life-cycle costs and qualification-type testing.",

        "abstract": "The Army has identified the need to enhance existing ground-based surveillance platforms by utilizing polarimetric imaging (PI).  Situational awareness imagery has become a vital tool for locating and helping to neutralize roadway threats.  The urgency of these threats demands quick, cost effective solutions that can be easily integrated into existing systems without loss of current functionality.  Kord Technologies proposes to address this need by modifying a bread board passive SWIR polarimeter maintained by Kratos Defense in order to collect active Mueller matrix signatures of IED type targets so they can be thoroughly evaluated for improved probability of detection (PD) performance.  PD algorithms will be developed to take advantage of the unique Mueller component images inherent in PI.  Successful assessment of polarimetric PD capability will lead to a comprehensive evaluation of the Army&quot;s Multi-Sensor System (MSS) and the creation of a detailed system design for augmenting the MSS to capture, process and display active SWIR polarimeteric imagery.  Kord will team with the MSS manufacturer, L-3 Wescam Sonoma, to provide guidance with the evaluation and design process and to help ensure successful transition to fabricating and testing an augmented MSS in Phase III.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The technological capacity to gather raw sensor data has far exceeded our capacity to exploit and understand it.  There are neither enough people available nor intelligent computer algorithms developed to process all incoming sensor data in real-time. To address this problem, Team Primordial (Primordial plus partners Panoptic, intuVision, and Carnegie Mellon University) proposes Tentacle, a multi-camera immersive surveillance system.  Simply put, Tentacle is software that facilitates quickly understanding what is happening now and in the past.  For its eyes, Tentacle uses the ever-growing number of battlefield sensors.  Tentacle fuses sensor feeds into a 3D virtual world comprised of imagery, terrain, and avatars representing people and vehicles. Tentacle works by integrating real-time feature extraction and tagging algorithms for detecting, tracking, and identifying entities with rule-based database query and dynamic alert tools for de-cluttering and highlighting relevant events.  In phase I, Primordial demonstrated Tentacle&quot;s ability to display a 3D world mimicking reality while supporting queries and alerts.  In phase II, Primordial will update Tentacle by improving its static tracking, entity correlation, metadata extraction, and behavior analysis algorithms.  We will also add support for tracking entities from moving platforms (e.g. UAVs) and performing spatial queries.  BENEFIT:  By fusing hundreds of video streams into a single synthesized 3D display and automatically flagging potential security events, Team Primordial anticipates that Tentacle will 1) increase an analyst&quot;s event detection probability, 2) reduce response time, 3) decrease the analyst to sensor ratio, 4) reduce fatigue, 5) increase job satisfaction, and 6) reduce turnover.  Tentacle will benefit large surveillance systems such as those found at airports, military bases, hotels, casinos, entertainment venues, federal buildings, hospitals, and large retail operations.  Northrop Grumman has expressed an interest in deploying Tentacle to 114 United States embassies under an existing State Department contract.  Raytheon has expressed an interest in deploying Tentacle to airports under an existing contract with the Chile Ministry of Defense and Administration.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Current LADAR analysis support tools and processes are inherently flawed due to the data-driven approaches that have guided the development of interfaces, automations, and other supports.  Analyst cognitive demands, requirements, and preferences have had little influence in the design of these tools.  As a result, these so called&quot;decision aids&quot;can often inhibit the decision making process.  In Phase II of this effort, we propose to continue our Phase I Cognitive Systems Engineering approach to develop an analyst-centric LADAR analysis support tool, leveraging the nascent Opticks LADAR add-on framework as a starting point. We will extend the cognitive task analysis and simulation interview protocols developed and executed in Phase 1 to fully describe and detail the decision points, cues and strategies, performance barriers, and current/future benefits associated with LADAR data analysis, leveraging a range of operational LADAR PED cell analysts and likely future NASIC users.   Our end product will promote efficient and effective analysis by: leveraging automation only where the analyst will need and accept it (e.g., improved line of sight analysis, automated colorization range enhancements, product support development); developing cognitively-based user interfaces; and implementing the Visual Checklist tool, which will describe the critical decision points in the analysis process.  BENEFIT:  Analyst-centric LADAR PED decision support tools will greatly enhance the ability of analysts to provide more effective and customized products to their customers.  Military benefactors of such tools (and the research we will conduct to derive them) include operational PED cells in Afghanistan and elsewhere as well as NASIC analysts and the Air Force LADAR R &amp; D community.  Multiple entities within the Department of Homeland Security would also benefit greatly from cognitively-based LADAR analysis support, whether they are managing borders or disasters.",

        "abstract": "Triton Systems Inc., with our partner Nammo-Talley, has developed a dual-purpose hand grenade with Phase I data demonstrating its essential feasibility. In this grenade a tailored thermobaric charge is contained within a composite body having a means to rapidly and unambiguously include or not include the effects of a fragment load designed for lethality equivalent to the M67. When the fragment load is not included in the grenade function, the effect is significantly greater than the M84 stun grenade and approximately on a par with the Mk3A2 concussion grenade. The grenade body and cap are injection molded composites, designed to provide positive identification of the grenade type and user-selected lethality level by both visual and tactile means, in order to avoid potentially fatal misapplication of the grenade in a more lethal mode when a less lethal effect is desired. The Phase II project will develop multi-mode grenade design to a high state of reliability and optimize the charge composition and weight to achieve the desired effects, defined by the US Army PM-Close Combat Systems and Infantry School at Ft.

First, TORIS predicts robot motion given the operators commands. Second, TORIS creates synthetic images to produce a video feed that looks as if the robot communication link had no delay and no reduced bandwidth. Finally, TORIS performs closed loop control on the robot platform to ensure that the robot follows the operators commands.",

Whereas many technologies and coatings have demonstrated the primary goal of achieving watershedding properties, they have lacked mechanical and environmental durability, or have been difficult or expensive to apply. Luna Innovations has demonstrated the use of a class of highly durable watershedding coatings, titled HARSH (Hard Abrasion Resistant SuperHydrophobic) for this application. Luna will further develop this transparent, hydrophobic, abrasion resistant coating developed in our laboratories for use on aircraft windscreens and canopies.

The electrodes are part of a 3-axis E-field sensing system, which also includes a pre-amplifier and an A/D circuit. Most current E-field sensors use a silver/silver-chloride (Ag/AgCl) electrode encased in conductive agar, which acts as a buffer between the electrode and the seawater. During the time it takes for these electrodes to come to equilibrium with the seawater upon buoy deployment, system performance can be degraded. The purpose of this effort is to develop a suitable electrode for employment in air-dropped buoys for ASW localization missions.. The primary tasks for this Phase are: (a) to identify whether alternative electrode types to the Ag/AgCl, primarily capacitive carbon electrodes, work better in the combination sonobuoy, (b) to determine the best way to buffer the electrodes, (c) to assess the feasibility and potential advantages of dry-storable electrodes vs. wet electrodes, and (d) to develop a prototype design for compact electrodes which can be packaged and stored within an A-size container for long periods prior to deployment, and open up automatically.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this proposal is to design devices using ultrasound induced neuromodulation to manage pain. Neurotrek, Inc (formerly SynSonix, LLC) has been developing ultrasound neuromodulation (UNMOD) to noninvasively stimulate neural circuitry.  Many studies have established the beneficial effects of neurostimulation for managing pain. However current methodologies require surgical implantation of stimulating electrodes which is an impractical solution for acute traumas. Pain management for acute traumas is generally accomplished with narcotics, which is less than ideal in a battlefield scenario as they severely effect cognitive abilities and have other unwanted side effects such as respiratory depression. Our technology of peripheral ultrasound neuromodulation (PUNMOD) offers several advantages over narcotics and current methods of neurostimulation. PUNMOD has the potential to be highly portable as a battlefield analgesic and has the advantage of leaving the patients cognitive abilities intact. In addition PUNMOD does not carry with it the risk of abuse or the need for the surveillance that is associated with pharmaceutical analgesics. In the current proposal we plan to build on our Phase I achievements by: 1) performing essential safety studies in a large animal model, 2) demonstrating a proof of concept for PUNMOD in humans and characterizing  the waveforms that modulate distinct pain modalities,3) developing strategies to focus UNMOD through bone with high spatial resolution, 4) characterizing a different type of US transducer that would confer several advantages, 5) developing an advanced prototype for the management of post-traumatic pain.",

During the Phase I, Metis Design Corporation (MDC) worked closely with Rolls-Royce Naval Marine (RR) to provide a proof of principal demonstration using previously developed sensor hardware. The system utilizes piezoelectric actuators/sensors to propagate ultrasonic waves in composite material, using the upper/lower surfaces as wave guides. RR manufactured representative propeller sections that tapered from 1.5&quot;to 0.5&quot;thick, which were tested in 1-meter of sea-water. Results demonstrated the ability to repeatedly measure presence and estimate severity of simulated delamination. Building on this success, the Phase II effort seeks to develop a customized system suitable for long-duration installation in a submarine environment. Major tasks will focus on the optimization of sensors and electrodes for relevant structural geometry, fabrication of suitable hardware that can withstand a relevant environment, development of robust algorithms to determining the state of the propellers, and finally a compelling underwater demonstration of a prototype system. The Phase II Option will aim to subsequently test the prototype system through a variety of environments and loads as well as quantifying the system performance and accuracy.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Under this Phase II effort, Design Interactive (DI) proposes the development of the Helmet-Mounted Display ASsessment System for the Evaluation of eSsential Skills (HMD-ASSESS), which will incorporate [neuro] physiological sensor technology with traditional behavioral and system-collected metrics to better understand how a pilot interacts with data presented in the HMD, including reactions and actions taken based on the data provided. This comprehensive, objective understanding of pilot interactions will be used to measure and diagnose pilot deficiencies/ inefficiencies, and can be used to dynamically monitor pilot performance, provide training evaluations and assessments of pilot proficiency, and populate targeted AARs/debriefings to enhance understanding of pilot errors and related root cause(s).  Such an innovative measurement and diagnostic solution will substantially improve pilot performance assessment during initial and sustainment training by quantitatively evaluating visual scan and search tasks associated with HMD-presented information. Such innovative metrics will peer into the&quot;mind of the pilots&quot;, thereby providing the capability to monitor traditionally&quot;unobservable&quot;performance related to perceptual and cognitive aspects of piloting.  BENEFIT:  The HMD ASSESS tool is hypothesized to lead to significant increases in the training effectiveness and efficiency of simulation based training.   Specifically, the HMD ASSESS approach will lead to significant increases in diagnosis of trainee knowledge, skills, abilities which will facilitate smarter interventions to optimally tailor scenarios and feedback to the trainee&quot;s progress.  The expected benefits of HMD ASSESS are:   Decreased Training Time:  Training is accelerated and compressed as HMD ASSESS detects traditionally unobservable perceptual and cognitive performance deficiencies such as inefficient scan and high workload, allowing an instructor to more effectively target deficiencies in debrief and future training   Improved Training:  Trainees reach higher levels of performance as feedback is tailored to trainee specific decrements at a very granular level effectively remediating required knowledge and skill decrements and leading to Warfighters being better prepared for live training and operations.",

        "abstract": "This SBIR phase-2.5 program is proposed to advance the state-of-the-art d36 shear mode projector which is the first known d36 underwater projector in the history of acoustic transduction devices. Phase II effort has shown significant advancements toward the d36 shear mode projectors in bandwidth and source level, especially its compact size. Ternary PIN-PMN-PT single crystals have been integrated into the device, which improved temperature stability and allows high, unbiased, driving fields. In order to bring it to a usable stage, we propose to develop a robust, high power, and broad bandwidth d36 shear mode projector array (12 elements). To achieve the goal, the following tasks are proposed: (1) Improving transducer fabrication methods, further optimizing device design, and testing and evaluation of these transducers at the array level; (2) Device optimization will look at improving electromechanical coupling and reducing stress in the crystal elements; (3) Fabrication improvements will include the use of crystal stacks to ease assembly, reduce the drive voltage requirements, and improve mechanical strength; and (4) Array level testing will look at frequency response, power and duty cycle characteristics, mutual impedance effects, and performance as a function of depth and temperature. The array predictions show improvements of 15 to 20 dB over other technologies operating in a similar band. We propose a budget of $ $ 897,078 to carry out the proposed works in a period of 12 months. A subcontract to the Applied Research Laboratory at Penn State University is for the design, optimization and validation of the prototype d36 shear mode crystal transducers. By the end of the contract period, we will evaluate the design and techniques developed and prepare for the commercialization of the shear mode crystal transducer.",

        "abstract": "Navy sonar transducer applications need to be developed that will fully exploit the range of improved performance made possible by the new formulations of piezocrystal materials. Similarly, naval transducer applications and requirements should be used to define the specific piezocrystal material properties that will most benefit naval sonar transducer performance.  These new and emerging piezocrystal materials will be characterized using a large signal Stress Dependent Electromechanical Characterization System (SDECS) measurement to provide their linear and non-linear electromechanical properties under a broad range of temperature-field-stress conditions to delineate the composition/properties that optimize performance for a variety of naval sonar transducer applications.  Progeny used the Phase I SDEC&quot;s data to model several candidate designs and finally selected the vehicle pinger for the Undersea Tracking Range Equipment (UTRE) Program, which currently uses multiple&quot;pinger&quot;transducers and matching networks to cover its frequency ranges of interest. To cover all frequencies of interest requires maintaining multiple transducers and tuning networks. Also as the size of undersea vehicles become ever smaller, the current size of the legacy pinger transducers becomes problematic.

        "abstract": "Aging aircraft experience fatigue cracking from stress concentrations around rivet holes. Current best practice is to pull an oversized mandrel through a split sleeve in the hole to induce beneficial residual compressive stresses and this improves fatigue life significantly. However, the benefit is reduced for chamfered rivet holes, where the compressive stresses are lower. The goal of this project is to use cavitation peening to enhance the cold expansion process by inducing deep, high magnitude residual compressive stresses around the hole and in the chamfered area, thereby improving fatigue life. The cavitation peening process currently uses a high pressure jet to sweep over the surface of the part while it is submerged in a water tank. This project will modify the technology so the part does not have to be submerged in a water tank so large structures can be cavitation peened. The cavitation peening equipment would be mounted on a roll around cart and the peening nozzle clamped to the surface to be peened. The process will be very inexpensive and clean with no shot or risk of foreign object damage. The system would be extremely versatile and could be used for a wide variety of applications, not just rivet holes.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  An optical technique for reliably separating and quantifying the liquid and vapor phases of real fuels has been elusive.  Challenges include multiple scattering in dense regions, complex laser interaction with the fuel, a wide range of length scales, and effects of temperature and pressure.  This proposal seeks to overcome these difficulties by (1) introducing a new approach to distinguishing yet capturing both the liquid and vapor phases, (2) removing the effects of multiple scattering, (3) capturing single-shot planar images of droplets, droplet size distributions, and vapor concentrations, and (4) utilizing and calibrating for real fuels, such as JP-8.  This will be accomplished through laser-induced fluorescence, phosphorescence, and Mie scattering combined with structured laser illumination.  In addition to developing a simplified diagnostic platform to perform these combined diagnostics, significant effort will be expended to analyze data from cold and heated sprays to determine calibration parameters for specific fuels such as JP-8.  The Phase I showed the feasibility of these proposed experimental methods, and the Phase II program will focus on the development of the laser-based planar imaging hardware and software system.  BENEFIT:  Proper fuel-air mixture preparation is critical for meeting the performance objectives of propulsion devices, including gas-turbine combustors, afterburners, pulsed-detonation engines, and rocket engines. The proposed work would provide new tools for visualizing the multiphase mixture preparation process in these devices for real fuels.  This will enable researchers to study ignition, flame stabilization, combustion efficiency, and emissions as a function of injector design and operation conditions, leading to improved performance for the warfighter.  In addition, the proposed laser diagnostic tools will be useful in a wide variety of multiphase flow applications, including commercial propulsion, stationary power generation, internal combustion engines, space heating, production of alternative fuels, and industrial sprays.  Hence, the advanced diagnostic hardware for simultaneous detection of multiple planar images and calibrated signal interpretation algorithms should see wide commercial potential.",

These instruments have exciting applications in the area of free electron lasers and directed energy weapons, but are costly and the two markets are small and highly specialized. Using these high energy Ebeams for materials processing may open up additional markets and provide a technological edge in applications exhibiting material-based deficiencies. In Phase I, Mainstream identified several materials processes, determined the required Ebeam parameters and projected their respective market sizes as well as commercial feasibility. In Phase II Mainstream will demonstrate Ebeam processing of selected materials with target applications and assess their application in technologically deficient areas. To accomplish this, a new type of superconducting electron linear accelerator will be constructed in partnership with a leading US Ebeam manufacturer and software will be developed to aid technicians in predicting the required Ebeam processing parameters. Phase II development will establish a marketplace for these highly specialized Ebeams as well as demonstrate several new materials technologies, which will be transitioned to high value and high demand products during follow-on effort.",

The system, code-named SNAPSHOT, uses commercially available DNA processing equipment and can be deployed within any DNA processing lab, even those in theater.  To date, the forensics community has used DNA as a mere biometric identifier, as though it contained no more information about an individual than a fingerprint or iris scan.  However, with the advent of fast, low-cost sequencing technology, which has enabled the creation of large genotype-to-phenotype datasets, the possibility now exists to computationally mine the human genetic content of DNA for variants that predict physical traits.  Having demonstrated the feasibility of producing such a SNAPSHOT trait prediction capability in Phase I, this Phase II project will deliver a working SNAPSHOT prototype and its performance will be demonstrated using blind and unblind testing, on unknown and known DNA samples, respectively, for a select set of traits that includes, among others, eye color, hair color, skin color and face morphology.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The objective of this proposal is to develop 202 inspection techniques that standardize both the inspection process and any defect data captured as part of the inspection in support of engineering analysis on 202 processes.  The Oklahoma City Air Logistics Center (OC-ALC) current processes are manual, paper based solutions that vary greatly based on the background and expertise of the person performing the inspection.  Developing a reliable, repeatable inspection process both reduces the inspection time (flow days) and improves the quality of the final product.  Unlike many other depot processes, inspections require that the personnel be well versed in all areas of the system.  This represents a huge training challenge that will also be addressed as part of the research.  To address the unique needs of the MRO environment, we propose to develop an inspection management system that can be quickly and easily customized to handle the many different inspection types.  It will simplify the current inspections and serve as a knowledge management aid to reduce training.  The standardized data collection techniques will enable detailed root cause and trend analysis as well as correlation analysis to forecast issues before they become critical and impact the system.  BENEFIT:  By standardizing the 202 inspection processes and defect data captured, our tools will minimize inspection time while improving the overall quality of the product, enable immediate engineering analysis, and provide longer term root cause and trend analysis.  Our tools will also reduce training time and provide the inspector all necessary technical material at the point of inspection.  The standardized defect data will eliminate the extensive data mining currently required, and enable detailed root cause and trend analysis.  This will allow issues to be identified early in the cycle and minimize the impact on the overall system.  This toolset has wide appeal and can be used throughout the DoD and private sector.",

Unlike today&quot;s quad-band cell phones that dynamically switch to the applicable frequencies to achieve interoperability with different service providers, NSS satellite communication (SATCOM) satellites are designed to operate at specific frequencies and cannot be altered once they are built and launched. In addition, the different modulation waveforms and interface parameters preclude connectivity even if the identical frequency bands were used. As such, there is a lack of interoperability and flexibility in the use of today&quot;s SATCOM capabilities.  Space Micro has developed a novel autonomous detection, characterization and demodulation technique that can enable SATOPS from many ground stations at very wide frequency range.  The Phase II effort will result in an Engineering Model demonstration of this capability with hardware that is form, fit and function equivalent to a flight unit.  BENEFIT:  The ASR product will provide significant benefits for SATOPS interoperability and flexibility.

This effort will combine new approaches in composite material design with our unique expertise in instrumented-Hot Isostatic Pressing (HIP) to develop a new generation of cost-efficient, low density and high strength composite materials.  In the proposed concept we will use mechanical alloying (MA) to prepare Mg-based alloys and strengthen them by dispersing hard particles, such as boron carbide, and achieving a nano-grained composite powder.  The powder will then be consolidated to full density using instrumented-HIP to minimize the exposure of the powder to high temperature and preserve the microstructure of the starting powder.  This primary consolidation step will be followed by secondary processing, such as extrusion or rolling, to break the oxide layer and enhance the mechanical properties of the composite.  During this program, we will demonstrate the use of MA and instrumented-HIP followed by secondary processing to achieve the desired nanostructure in a fully dense composite, and quantify the mechanical properties of the composite and their dependence on the amount of reinforcement.

        "abstract": "Many Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) systems involve combining track data from multiple sources, leading to an improved track picture. A multitude of track fusion algorithms exist, some of which require significant computational resources and have difficulty running in real-time when thousands of tracks must be maintained. Ideally, we would like to evaluate the utility of the various track fusion algorithms for a particular system. An analysis of different track fusion algorithms based on real data from the ISR system in which they will be deployed would yield the most accurate assessment of track fusion performance; however, this requires data from real experiments, which is often difficult to obtain in any quantity. An alternative is to test and evaluate algorithms within a simulated environment that can model to some degree of realism the conditions under which the system will operate (and can vary those conditions to conduct thorough trade studies). On this effort, Toyon will develop a T2T fusion test bed in order to analyze the performance of various T2T fusion algorithms under simulated scenarios of operation relevance to the Navy. The test bed will include an ISR simulation, T2T fusion application with multiple T2T association and fusion algorithms, and a performance analysis tool for calculating MOPs and MOEs.",

CREATE facilitates joint optimization of routing and dynamic spectrum allocation to balance the throughput-delay trade-offs with security and energy objectives under realistic physical channel effects. Robust network adaptation is supported by asynchronous and distributed spectrum negotiation and coordination channels that balance different exploration-exploitation trade-offs involving network stability and spectrum agility objectives.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Demand for Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) within the U.S. Military has significantly increased over the past decade, including Micro-Air Vehicles (MAVs). However, effective use of these systems has been hindered by the lack of natural interfaces for controlling them. Currently multiple operators are required to manage all aspects of a single aircraft, and pilots interact using joysticks or point-and-click interfaces that require their full attention. The work proposed here seeks to enable one operator to exert supervisory control over multiple MAVs using multiple modes of interaction in order to reduce the burden on the operator while maintaining situational awareness. To accomplish this, we will build and evaluate a prototype multi-modal Smart Interaction Device for MAVs (SID/MAV), which will allow pilots to use natural means of interacting such as speech and gesture to interact with multiple MAVs. We will extend our prior work to this new domain, including new input modalities and a new plug-in to interface with RPA control systems via STANAG 4586 messaging. We will evaluate SID/MAV on a portable tablet in a laboratory setting and in a live-flight setting. SID/MAV will enable supervisory control of one or more RPAs, and greatly reduce the workload of the RPA operator.  BENEFIT:  A natural multi-modal interaction system for supervisory control of RPAs has the potential to change the face of RPA systems. Current battlefield RPAs effectively require multiple people to operate, including navigation, system health monitoring, and payload and mission management. Changing the way in which an operator can interact with each RPA, using more natural input modalities and including feedback from that RPA in natural modalities, frees the operator to work at a higher level of interaction. This in turn will allow for a single operator to more easily manage multiple RPAs, much like a human team lead can manage multiple subordinates. Our system, a Smart Interaction Device for Micro Air Vehicles (SID/MAV) will be capable of managing diverse RPAs though a single natural control interface. SID/MAV will be deployable to multiple computing platforms, such as tablets or laptops, enabling wide access to RPA control, either in a control center or in the field.  Beyond RPA applications in reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition (RSTA) missions, supervisory control of autonomous entities has a great deal of potential in a range of fields: managing all kinds of ground and airborne unmanned systems; managing entities in large-scale simulation environments, where hundreds or even thousands of entities play a part; and managing intelligent virtual characters in immersive trainers.",

It consists of innovative deployable solar arrays combined with a sun tracking gimbal assembly that is initially optimized for a 3U but readily adaptable to a 6U Bus configuration.  The significance to the Air Force of our innovative solution is that it allows the spacecraft to maintain high power while freeing the mission instruments to track an area of interest, thus improving mission utility, flexibility and capability.  The E-HaWK innovations further demonstrate MMA&quot;s NanoSat modular solar power architecture for providing a range of mission power options and leverages from our core solar power technologies.    BENEFIT:  1. Space Situational Awareness  two axis sun tracking allows the S/C to maintain high continuous power while simultaneously freeing the mission instruments to track an AOI, thus improving mission capability, flexibility and utility.  2. Mission ISR data and quality can increase with increases in power capabilities, power tracking and performance.    3. Maximizing the utility of the available volume by combining the functions of solar power and de-orbiting into one robust deployable system.  4.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Physical Sciences Inc. (PSI) has designed an integrated optical receiver circuit capable of performing optical thresholding and clock recovery from received signals in space communications systems. During the proposed Phase II program, PSI in collaboration with the Bell Labs group of LGS Innovations will fabricate and deliver a prototype optical receiver system to the Air Force. The PSI design uses novel optical frequency mixers in lithium niobate that are compatible with any modulation format and data rates beyond 100 Gb/s. PSI has extensive experience implementing optical signal processing functions using the mature lithium niobate material system, which has been proven in satellite applications. The Bell Labs group is a world leader in the hybrid integration of optoelectronic components and will fabricate a prototype optical receiver compatible with 10 Gb/s data rates and power levels expected in transmission between low-earth orbit satellites. The prototype will combine the optical frequency mixer with a laser, detectors, and electronics on a single substrate to prove the system concept. The device will be tested at PSI and delivered to the Air Force for further system testing.  BENEFIT:  This proposed project will support the development of a novel integrated optical receiver platform intended for initial use in satellite-borne high-speed communications systems. The compact size, low weight, and low power consumption of the design are key virtues that will simplify deployment of space-based communications systems. The technology will be directly applicable to military space communications systems that currently in planning stages. It will also enable cost-effective commercial space-based communications links that are envisioned as a future supplement to terrestrial long-haul fiber optic communication links.",

        "abstract": "The unpredictable and complex environment of current military operations poses significant cognitive challenges for today&quot;s warfighters. Superior cognitive function is necessary for warfighters to be able to critically assess their surrounding environment, quickly and effectively solve problems, make decisions, and adapt to changing or unanticipated situations. Recent scientific advances suggest that cognitive training could lead to increased general cognitive abilities, including enhancement in fluid intelligence.  Despite the encouraging results suggesting improvement in fluid intelligence through cognitive skills training, there is still very little consensus in the literature on how to develop effective cognitive skills training or how to evaluate it, including assessing transfer to real-world situations. Aptima&quot;s solution for training and improving cognitive function is called PACT (Portable Adaptive Cognitive Training). PACT will be an ultra-portable, platform agnostic, adaptive training game system that will enhance cognitive capacity in healthy as well as cognitively impaired individuals through the use of empirically validated cognitive exercises embedded into an engaging and motivating game environment.

During the Phase I effort an uncalibrated brassboard system was built and flight tested using a manned biplane. The brassboard system comprised an experimental single-channel (L1-only) software GPS receiver, and a 720 deg/hr inertial measurement unit (IMU) costing only $1k. The performance of the brassboard system was comparable to that of a $42k precision reference system that comprised a dual-channel (L1 and L2) GPS receiver and antenna, and a tactical-grade (1 deg/hr) IMU ($24k). This tactical-grade performance was achieved by fusing low-cost inertial measurements with attitude and position measurements from a GPS-based attitude (GPS/A) sensor. The Miniature Integrated Direction-finding Attitude-determining Anti-jam System (MIDAAS(TM)) obtains position, velocity, attitude, and time (PVAT) measurements directly from GPS signals and employs an innovative small single-aperture antenna to compute full 3-D attitude (roll, pitch and yaw) using only two RF channels, leading to a smaller, simpler, lower-cost GPS/A receiver system. During the Phase II program, a form-fit-function prototype system will be designed, built, and flight tested in an operational environment. The prototype performance will be compared with that of a higher-accuracy, more expensive attitude reference system.",

These systems are also referred to as outdoor wood-fired hydronic heaters or outdoor wood-fired furnaces. There are currently over 500,000 OWBs installed, primarily in the northern US. During the Phase I SBIR project, a catalytic combustor system that can be retrofitted onto existing OWBs to reduce their emissions was designed and tested. Testing was conducted on a Central Boiler Model Classic 5036. Results showed that visible smoke emissions were greatly reduced and that particulate emissions were reduced over 50 percent and carbon monoxide emissions were reduced by 65 percent. The Phase II program will further develop testing and measurement protocols, determine the optimum combustor catalyst-support combination, examine supplemental air supply for the combustor redesign the retrofit unit for easy maintenance, conduct testing of non-ideal fuels, and conduct long-term testing. It is expected that results from these tasks will identify an optimum retrofit design for use on existing 0WBs.

        "abstract": "As part of its mission to protect human health and the environment, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency develops and promotes innovative cleanup strategies that restore contaminated sites to productive use, reduce associated costs, and promotes environmental stewardship. Testing and characterization of the environment for potentially harmful contaminants is a costly endeavor. Current technologies used for environmental characterization require collection of a sample following by its transfer to a laboratory for analysis. The laboratory approach is labor intensive, time consuming, expensive, and does not provide the local site with information in a timely manner. On site analysis using portable instrumentation is often preferred because it is cost effective and rapid. Unfortunately current portable analytical devices are limited by size, low sensitivity to contaminants, and by restrictions in the type of contaminants they can detect. This proposal concerns the development a new automated field deployable analytical laboratory. The proposed device is uniquely able to analyze a variety of both organic and metallic contaminants in environmental samples. A multiplicity of innovative components and designs for sample pre-concentration, separation, fluid transfer and detection were introduced, with emphasis on microfluidic components and processes. The new designs specifically address critical technical road blocks to the further development of fieldable analytical devices. Laboratory test results carried out in the Phase I study were highly favorable. Detection of parts per billion levels of toxic metal contaminants in water samples was achieved, as was detection of trace levels of organic contaminants, such as BTEX.  A Technology Niche Analysis showed that there is a strong commercial pull for this technology, in line with current trends in the $3.8 billion dollar analytical Instrumentation industry. During the Phase II an automated system capable of detection of both metal and organic contaminants in ground water will be developed. This instrument will potentially provide accurate, inexpensive, easy-to-use and sustainable (green) detection capabilities that can be used by both trained and untrained (community) personnel and allow for more rapid hazardous waste site cleanups.",

        "abstract": "Large farms and feedlot operations produce large quantities of manure in a small area. Anaerobic digester units capable of producing pipeline quality methane installed at each farm or dairy could be instrumental in eliminating the difficulties associated with the transport of manure off site. If consumed properly, use of manure-derived fuels can also protect against environmental problems such as groundwater leaching and greenhouse gas emissions (methane emissions) associated with land filling of the farm wastes. The use of anaerobic digester gas reduces the amount of methane emitted into the atmosphere and provides a new and untapped resource of energy. TDA Research, Inc (TDA) is developing a vacuum swing adsorption (VSA) based system for upgrading the biogas produced from farm wastes to pipeline specifications. TDA's system uses a novel low cost, high capacity CO2 adsorbent to convert the biogas to pipeline quality methane. The vacuum swing adsorption process results in a low methane loss, \t\t\tmore than 95% of the methane entering the separation unit is sent to the pipeline and the unit has very low capital and operating costs.  Results:  In Phase I TDA successfully demonstrated the feasibility of TDA's VSA system to produce pipeline quality methane from biogas in bench-scale experiments and showed its economic viability through process simulations and engineering analysis. In Phase II TDA will build and test a sub-scale prototype unit and scale up production of the sorbent. As part of Phase II TDA will carry out a field demonstration in actual biogas derived from wastes. TDA has partnered with CDM (Seattle, WA) to carry out a field demonstration of our technology in combination with the pilot-scale ADG system that they will be building and operating at Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, CO to run on food wastes. The installation and operation of the ADG system is funded by the DoD and will be available at no-cost to the EPA.                                                                                            Potential Commercial Applications:  This technology will enable animal and dairy farms to solve a major waste \"manure\" handling problem. This will also provide a cheaper way to upgrade the biogas to a high-value fuel, pipeline methane that can be exported from the farm. It will also find use in waste water treatment, food processing industry or any other facilities that use anaerobic digestion and want to sell pipeline quality natural gas instead of burning the gas on-site.",

        "abstract": "The integrity of water piping infrastructures is essential for providing safe drinking water and for the treatment of wastewater. As pipelines age, they deteriorate, corrode, and crack. Existing techniques, such as visual observation and closed circuit TV, for assessing piping integrity are expensive and have difficulty accessing particular regions of piping structures. Ultrasonic guided waves, on the other hand, have the capability of penetrating multi-layered structures, such as pipes with concrete linings.  This makes it possible to detect defects under concrete lining that can be difficult to find using visual observation and closed circuit TV. Another associated problem is axial crack detection in large diameter water pipes. Ultrasonic guided waves propagating in pipe circumferential directions have an innate sensitivity to axial cracks. During the Phase 1 portion of this project, we demonstrated the feasibility of axial crack detection using circumferential guided waves and defect detection \t\t\tin a concrete lined pipe using axial guided waves. In Phase II, we will focus on the development of two prototype systems. One is a circumferential guided wave tool that is capable of detecting axial cracks by traveling through the inside of a steel water pipe. The other combines guided wave focusing techniques with the recently developed magnetostrictive sensors for defect screening of concrete lined water lines. Magnetostrictive sensors are flexible, robust, light-weight, and low cost. They are also capable of producing strong guided wave energy in pipelines. FBS has extensive experience with piping defect detection using long range ultrasonic guided waves; acquired through ONR, DOT, and EPRI sponsored work. We recognize the need for reliable, economic, and safe inspection solutions for the maintenance and assessment of water piping. The proposed work builds on FBS accomplishments to date. The work is dedicated to an economic implementation of the proposed inspection method(s).

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will employ the large scale; highly reliable boron-doped ultrananocrystalline diamond (BD-UNCD\u00ae) electrodes developed during Phase I project to build and test Electrochemical Anodic Oxidation process (EAOP) cells and systems that can destroy Contaminants of Emerging Concern more economically and effectively than competing AOPs. BD-UNCD cells are likely to demonstrate higher rates of organiccontaminant destruction at lower costs and with greater energy efficiency than competing electrodes due to higher current densities allowing smaller electrode sizes and higher rates of hydroxyl-radical generation. The known difficulties with existing EAOP electrodes (e.g. DSA) such as an inadequate rate of destruction of refractory molecules, unreliable operation below 10\u00b0C, generation of large quantities of 02 and H2, which worsen current efficiency and present safety concerns, electrode fouling, limited electrode lifetime and an inability to be \t\t\t\treverse-polarized are addressed using BD-UNCD electrodes as was demonstrated in the Phase I. The powerful combination of hydroxyl radicals, H202 and other strong oxidants fanned at the BD-UNCD anode is capable of oxidative destruction of even refractory organics such as trichloroethylene. BD-UNCD EAOP typically reduces the cost by at least an order of magnitude compared to competing AOPs.      The non-chemical water treatment market in the USA for 2009 was greater than $4 billion. Much of this market is addressed by ozonolysis, which is at least an order of magnitude more expensive and less effective for refractory organics. The potential market for a lower-cost water purification technology capable of destruction of refractory organics is therefore expected to exceed the current ozonolysis market Current methods are problematic for many reasons including, poor mineralization; formation of persistent by-products; usually limited to lower concentration wastes; they also require the addition, and subsequent \t\t\t\temoval, of chemicals such as H202 or Ozone; require pH adjustments, safety hazards associated with transporting chemical and energy inefficiency with high carbon footprints. Overcoming these technical barriers will require advances in the Synthesis and large-scale manufacturing of diamond thin films (completed in phase II) and their application and tuning to the target wastewaters with the highest economic and environmental impact. The electrochemistry of diamond requires investigation under EAOP conditions. Better understanding of these reactions and the tradeoffs between cell design and electrode geometry will impact related applications including the electrochemical Synthesis and the development of compact systems for third-world potable water, desalination, and marine applications, and other On-Site Generation of advanced oxidants.",

As with previous PS-CRDS measurements, we excite a resonant cavity with amplitude modulated energy and measure the phase shift of the modulated signal exiting the cavity which is proportional to the ring down time and inversely proportional to the losses of the cavity including molecular absorption. ln contrast to previous efforts we impose the amplitude modulation with the FTIR interferometer instead of an external electro-optical modulator and extract the phase from each interferogram thereby enabling broadband FTlR-PS-CRDS measurements at greater than I Hz update rates. The measured phase spectra can then be used for multicomponent analysis. The combined measurement can be viewed as a resonant cavity enhancement to traditional FTIR spectroscopy or a broadband enhancement to CRDS.       Under the Phase I we established the feasibility of our approach through the design, build, and test of a breadboard FTIR-PS-CRDS system. We measured the phase noise and reconciled the results with our analytical models predicting system performance. We demonstrated an FTIR-P-CRD measurement on vapor phase methanol. Under a Phase II effort we will improve the sensitivity of the measurement by two and a half orders of magnitude realized with a portable and ruggedized prototype system. We will characterize the system and demonstrate phase measurements on multi-gas mixtures.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  An engineering computational simulation tool based on the shrinking core model of nanoparticle combustion is proposed to investigate ignition, combustion and performance of nano-energetic particles in a variety of oxidizing environments, including those found in rockets and air breathing propulsion devices. The computational model will include appropriate models for the bulk, oxide, and gas-phase, including phase changes in the oxide layer with subsequent changes in diffusivity, and will take into account various other physics, such as alloying, coating, and oxide layer treatments. An experimental program will be carried out to aid in model development and for model validation. Validation experiments will be conducted at the University of Illinois shock tube and combustion facilites, and will be conducted under relevant conditions for the application, including at elevated pressures, elevated ambient temperatures, appropriate levels of particle loading, and in relevant gas-phase environments. Multiple methods for measuring combustion time and temperature will be explored, along with hydrocarbon and flame environments, and multiple nanoparticle materials. The commercialization target is the development of a computational model to predict the combustion characteristics of nano-energetic particles in various oxidizing environments. These include those commonly found in rocket propulsion chambers and in air-breathing propulsion devices using traditional fuels such as JP-8 and RP-1.  BENEFIT:  There is keen interest in nano-energetic combustion research in the U.S. Air Force (at least AFRL-Edwards and AFOSR) and in the Army for energetic material and propulsion uses. The RocSCM code  our commercial simulation code modeling the shrinking core method for nano-energetic combustion resulting from this Phase II SBIR -- will facilitate significant scientific advances and understanding of nano-energetic combustion in many different propulsion and energetic applications of interest to the military. RocSCM will ultimately be integrated with the other meso- and micro-modeling codes in the IMSim system (a complementary IllinoisRocstar LLC product for predicting insensitive munitions behavior of energetic materials), portions of which are actively supported by the Air Force (Edwards AFB, Eglin AFB). More broadly, modeling propellant and energetic materials is of interest to DoD agencies, as well as NASA and other commercial producers of energetic materials such as ATK and Aerojet. We maintain working relationships with personnel in all of these organizations, as well as at the Department of Energy National Laboratories, where research into mesoscale modeling of energetic materials is pervasive and ongoing. We believe that these governmental agencies will be interested in the developing and completing the IMSim system, including extension of RocSCM, for propulsion (solid propellant rockets), munitions performance, and safety analyses.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Eddy current testing (ECT) is a widely practiced and critically important nondestructive evaluation (NDE) method used in aerospace, yet it relies on decades-old, wire-coil sensors.  Flexible sensors are needed to inspect curved surfaces near the edges of components including wheel bead seats on landing gear and dove tail slots on turbine rotor disks.  For many tests, the large signal generated by the nearby edge of a component overwhelms the small signal due to a defect.   RMD, in collaboration with Wyle Laboratories, proposes a flexible, solid-state ECT sensor probe made from a linear array of microscopic, directionally-sensitive, solid-state eddy current sensors.  The high sensitivity ECT probes will greatly enhance the probability of detection (POD) of measurements near the edges of curved components.  The multiple element sensor arrays will allow faster, high resolution inspections.    The modular sensor array will be compatible with existing ECT systems so that it can be adopted without the expense of buying new equipment, or training personnel in new ECT methodologies.  The sensor array will be fabricated on thin durable plastic (approximately 100 um thick) that is highly flexible so that it can be used on tightly curved surfaces.     BENEFIT:  DOD APPLICATIONS   The proposed technology provides superior sensors for ECT to achieve high resolution detection of minute defects near the edges of components and in difficult to access areas.  The proposed ECT technology will be useful for inspecting landing gear, engine components, flight surfaces, support structures, titanium castings, hydraulic lines and other components that are made of standard or advanced metallic materials. The technology will permit inspection of thick components in 3-D. For materials testing and development, incipient defects can be detected and their propagation monitored and analyzed during aging. Since the technology can be used to improve manufacturing and the selection of materials, and to test finished components and aging systems, it will have a broad impact on the efficiency and effectiveness of DoD missions.         COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS   The advanced ECT sensor technology proposed here will enable inspectors to detect extremely small defects near edges and other features of components.  It will be simple to use and compatible with existing ECT systems. Eddy current testing is the most widely used NDE technique with a market value in excess of $200M/year in the US alone. Some of the commercial market areas where the new technology has promise include: pipelines, heat exchangers, oil refineries, aircraft, ship and other transport vehicle inspection, jet engine inspection, manufacturing and QA of metallic components.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The concept of Space Time Coding  (STC) was first described in the technical literature in the mid-1990s.  In 1998, Alamouti introduced a specific form of STC that is rate 1, meaning that it does not expand the bandwidth of the signal.  The Alamouti STC is particularly well suited to the aeronautical telemetry channel, and a prototype Alamouti STC system has been built and tested at Edwards AFB.  The results of those flight tests showed substantial improvement in overall data integrity, compared to traditional telemetry schemes.    This proposal addresses the migration of the STC hardware from an experimental prototype to a market-ready product.    BENEFIT:  Space-Time Coding can eliminate the telemetry dropouts caused by inter-antenna interference.",

        "abstract": "The overall aim of this Phase II SBIR is to augment the Foveated Vision Technologies (FOVIS) system under development by enabling high-speed wireless communication of images/video in high multipath and Non-Line-of-Sight links. Ziva proposes a novel and powerful approach called Time Reversal Software Radios (TARDIS) to enable enhanced communication in cluttered and unpredictable channels. TARDIS technology produces the optimal spatio-temporal matched filtering in any channel through Time Reversal (TR) precoding, producing significant gains and enabling diffraction-limited focusing at the intended receiver through coherent alignment of multipath echoes.  Ziva&quot;s TARDIS approach provides up to 20dB gain to the intended receiver. Implementation of TR is straightforward, robust, fully automatic, rapid, and requires no hardware beyond that of typical software defined radio (SDR) systems. TR operates by sounding the channel&quot;s multipath propagation characteristics and using a time-reversed version of the multipath sounding as a precoding filter. The communication channel acts as the perfect matched filter which results in coherently harvesting the multipath components into TR gain. The output of the proposed program is to demonstrate TR waveforms on a SDR platform and evaluate its performance via simulations in a variety of real multipath and non-line of sight RF environments.",

        "abstract": "The need for clean, reliable electrical power is increasing in both the military and commercial sectors, which places high priority on technologies that provide flexibility and increased energy independence. The potential for reduced maintenance, high reliability, and increased durability is currently being demonstrated with microturbine generator (MTG) hardware. Currently these MTGs have been large in scale for industrial or utilities application; however, advances are being made in the development of more compact microturbine auxiliary power units (APUs), or turbogenerators, that build upon the advances of miniature (less than 100 pound thrust) turbojet engines. The efficiency of these compact turbogenerators is being dramatically improved through the addition of recuperator technology, thereby enabling a greatly reduced power generation footprint.    The IS4S team has investigated, through modeling and simulation, the architecture and controls necessary to take compact (less than 30 kW) turbogenerators and parallel them to form a stable and reliable microgrid. The simulation and control algorithms provide the groundwork for Phase II development and demonstration using actual turbogenerator hardware. The IS4S team proposes to leverage the lessons learned in the Phase I and combine electronics and turbogenerator hardware in order to provide a microgrid test bed. The resulting controller will seek to maximize the system efficiency, with automatic startup/shutdown of units while reacting to real-time load variations.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The overarching objective for this project is to develop a validated analysis tool to predict the behavior of damaged and repaired bolted joints in composites.  The primary objective for the proposed Phase II effort will be to develop a prototype design environment for a fully parametric, calibrated and validated, bolted joint damage and repair evaluation design environment using multiple capabilities of StressCheck and a Design OF Experiments approach to calibration, validation, and verification of the analytical models.  This analytical tool will demonstrate the feasibility of a multi-scale, FEA-based, design and analysis tool capable of evaluating the various details of typical bolted joints at a scale that is adequate for each detail of interest.  A test program, based upon the widely adopted and accepted building block format, will be used to perform two main functions.  The first function will be to supply relevant and unique coupon and element level test data that will be used to calibrate the FEA-based analysis models.  The second function will be to generate higher level (element and sub-component) test data to validate the analysis tools over the entire realm of the design space over which the tool is expected to be deployed.  BENEFIT:  Following the success of the Phase II prototype development effort, the design environment developed in Phase II can be made available for initial deployment for evaluation and improvement.  Involvement of initial users can be leveraged to accelerate the development and expansion of the capabilities of the tool in parallel with the Phase III effort.  When brought to fruition in Phase II, the end result will be a calibrated and validated analytical design environment prototype that can be widely deployed among the dispersed engineering teams on any given program.  It will be capable of addressing in a parametric fashion, multiple types of damage and failure, along with subsequent repairs.  This initial set of configurations will allow engineering teams to investigate a wide range of damage and repair scenarios.     The design environment developed in Phase II will be structured as a modular, multi-scale, and expandable tool.  Customers will be able to integrate this tool within their existing analytical framework in a complementary manner.  It will incorporate a fully parametric formulation for every aspect of the inputs and outputs of the 3D solid element, ply-by-ply FEA models that will allow for encapsulation and automation of the entire set of analytical steps required to fully evaluate any given range of configurations.  This will also allow the user to capture every relevant detail that may have an effect on the evaluation.  The Phase II test effort will provide a good foundation for determining a standardized methodology for calibrating and validating analytical models such that they can be trusted to yield accurate results over the entire segment of the design space that they are configured to evaluate.  This approach will open up the entire feasible design space for use by the engineer.",

The upgrade will be engineered for the higher noise levels expected in the new CH-53K heavy-lift helicopter. We will focus on maximizing the passive attenuation provided by the helmet rather than introducing additional active electronics. We will also integrate an option for a communications earplug. Earplugs offer additional hearing protection and redundancy, as well as improved communications intelligibility. However, current earplugs have issues with fit, comfort, and performance in the field. To address these issues, we propose to develop an innovative earplug that is easily inserted and removed but seals deep in the ear canal. During the Phase I project, we proved the feasibility of our upgrade approach by demonstrating a large improvement in the attenuation provided by an upgraded helmet, particularly at low frequencies. Furthermore, we successfully demonstrated a prototype of our innovative earplug concept. In Phase II we will refine the upgrade design, select components, fabricate integrated prototypes, and measure their performance in the laboratory and in the field.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Nearly half of all U.S. and coalition deaths in Afghanistan are due to improvised explosive devices (IEDs). In addition, more than 600 IED incidents occur monthly throughout the rest of the world. While JIEDDO has introduced a number of sensor technologies that reduce the effectiveness of a given IED, the total number of devices continues to rise. Insurgents adapt and counteract new detection methods, and no one system is currently capable of detecting multiple components of an IED threat. To address this challenge, LGS is teamed with the University of Washington, Ahura, Rajant, and Raytheon to build a system that standardizes and normalizes heterogeneous sensor data in a repository. This data is then pulled into a cognitive engine that uses an artificial neural network to calculate an overall probability of an IED utilizing the sensor data, its known limitations, and outside reference sources. The information is reported in near real time on a laptop, with data sharing to continuously improve the predictive capabilities. A radio interface allows use with sensors that lack communication capabilities as well. This technology will virtually eliminate IED false positives and false negatives, while creating an ever changing sensor platform to which the enemy cannot adapt.  BENEFIT:  IED detection equipment is currently a $5.6 billion market worldwide providing a large commercialization opportunity for the Phase II prototype in improving Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) and combat engineer mission efficiency, while protecting warfighters, Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and law enforcement personnel worldwide. The prototype system will significantly improve IED predictive capabilities and reduce false positives by an estimated 50-75%. The initial system will work with explosive, Ground Penetrating and Synthetic Aperture Radar (GPR/SAR), Radio Frequency (RF) detectors, video/intelligence feeds, and seismic sensors. Once matured, the technology will also be applicable to the $7.5 billion artificial intelligence and sensing market in applications both within and outside the DoD. These include automatic target recognition and Identification Friend-or-Foe (IFF), as well as generalized multi-sensor decision support in consumer, environmental, agricultural, medical, and safety applications.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Current air, ground and space networks are very dynamic with large-scale mobility needing human in-the-loop configuration to adapt to unforeseen situations.  Humans and current automated systems cannot reconfigure consistently or fast enough.  This leads to network performance not meeting mission needs.  Airborne, space and ground networks are crypto-partitioned, dynamic, complex, and hard for the current human-centric management systems to maintain optimal routes consistently when networks scale up to large numbers and large distances.  Non-optimal routes and reactions to network disruptions affect the warfighters ability to communicate with others, maintain situational awareness and effectively complete their missions.  The Air Force identified the need to use network context to manage dynamic networks automatically.  ATCorp&quot;s Context Aware Scalable Dynamic Network (CASDN) uses context to improve performance.  During the Phase II, ATCorp will build a prototype of CASDN&quot;s context based network management that provide overlay routing between red-side enclaves, and optimized traffic management across crypto-partitioned networks.  By tracking and sharing context throughout a network, CASDN will enable the effective use of context to manage dynamic networks automatically.  BENEFIT:  CASDN fulfills the Air Force&quot;s requirements for a context-aware network routing and management system capable of tracking and using context to optimize a dynamic network.  CASDN will maintain mission assured network connectivity, and optimize network performance.  The benefits to crypto-partitioned high-performance network routing &amp; management will be a significant contribution to global sets of information available from the U.S. Space Surveillance Network and future DoD communications systems such as Battlefield Airborne Communications Node (BACN); the Navy&quot;s Next Generation Enterprise Network (NGEN); WIN-T and Joint Capability for Airborne Networking (JCAN).

        "abstract": "The Navy is procuring small unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) to augment battlespace awareness in complex littoral environments, but these platforms require the development of navigation solutions that provide accurate localization at low size, weight, power, and cost (SWAP-C). To enable high-accuracy navigation at low SWAP-C, we developed a prototype system for Combining Aiding Sensors with Multiple IMUs for Navigation Optimization (CAMINO). CAMINO uses a novel hierarchical particle filter to combine noisy measurements from multiple inertial measurement units (IMUs) and direct observations of platform state from aiding sensors (e.g., depth sensors and magnetometers) into an accurate estimate of UUV geolocation and orientation. Our CAMINO system, using two IMUs, achieved more accurate localization results than dead reckoning and particle filtering based on measurements from a single IMU. CAMINO also outperformed nave methods of combining multiple IMUse.g., averaging two dead reckoned locationsdemonstrating the value of CAMINO&quot;s hierarchical particle filter and local density reweighting. Critically, CAMINO achieves this localization accuracy at lower SWAP-C than currently available high-accuracy navigation systems, making CAMINO a promising option for small UUV navigation. In Phase II, we will build and demonstrate an in-water CAMINO prototype capable of processing live sensor feeds and localizing a platform in real-time.",

        "abstract": "Infrared imaging systems using HgCdTe photodiode arrays are being developed to meet ever more stringent requirements. Thermal anneals are used for a number of purposes in HgCdTe technology: for reducing the Hg vacancy concentration by annealing at or near the Hg saturation pressure, for dopant diffusions under a specific Hg vapor pressure, for annealing after ion implants to diffuse the implanted element, and for activating implanted/diffused dopants. In the most commonly used anneal procedure, several HgCdTe wafers are sealed (using a glass-blowing torch) into an evacuated fused-quartz ampoule along with a small amount of Hg. Practical problems occur for HgCdTe wafers over about 5 cm in diameter. First, larger quartz ampoules become more difficult to seal under vacuum and the extended sealing time may lead to heating and damaging the HgCdTe wafers. Second, the cost of the quartzware destroyed in the process becomes more significant in larger sizes. Under an NVESD Phase I SBIR Contract we have developed and demonstrated a new open-tube anneal apparatus and process for HgCdTe wafers that avoids these problems, and which has a number of additional benefits, including the ability to rapidly switch anneal conditions for multi-step diffusion/activation anneals.",

Recently, the need to perform adaptive optics compensation for strong and distributed turbulence has kindled interest in new wavefront sensor designs that must perform where the local rms wavefront gradients exceeds one wavelength per subaperture. In addition, new wavefront sensors are expected to operate passively, using information from a complex scene to determine the refractive distortion. Nanohmics has designed, fabricated, tested, and demonstrated a breadboard version of a new type of wavefront sensor that is suitable for the measurement of large wavefront figures resulting from distributed turbulence or large static aberrations. The sensor measures the wavefront error from observations of an extended scene, and is inherently immune to crosstalk between adjacent subapertures, even for very large local wavefront slopes. Nanohmics proposes to integrate a wavefront sensor on a Navy optical surveillance platform with a deformable mirror and associated optical components to demonstrate closed-loop adaptive-optics compensation of dynamic aberrations experienced by the telescope, platform window, and atmospheric turbulence during operations of the surveillance platform, resulting in improved ISR imagery.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The emergence of a diverse selection of new high-power terahertz sources has highlighted the critical need for a calibrated, independent, broadband terahertz spectrum analyzer. Present spectrum analyzers work at either microwave frequencies or in the far infrared, and only source specific detection mechanisms are available, limiting broad comparison and classification.  The characterization of high power sources is essential as the health impact (if any) of such devices is investigated, and the classification of these devices based on power frequency distribution by an independent and common spectrum analyzer is essential for side-by-side comparison.     We propose to implement a true THz spectrum analyzer using a rapidly scanning circular involute delay line coupled with a high speed broadband pyroelectric detector in a modified Michelson interferometer configuration. During phase I, we demonstrated the feasibility of this approach coupled with both pulsed and CW THz sources. In phase II, we will realize a compact (12&quot;x8&quot;x5&quot;), real-time (&gt;5 Hz), broadband (&gt;10THz), high resolution (&lt;10GHz) THz spectrum analyzer. Development will include several field tests at high power THz sources of interest to the Air Force, and a calibration process will be established to insure robust source classification, regardless of emission mechanism or output power.    BENEFIT:  The resulting THz spectrum analyzer will be a useful diagnostic tool for new THz sources and as a calibration tool for existing sources. We anticipate as commercial applications become available for THz systems, this will be an essential tool for the calibration, lifecycle measurement and maintenance of THz sources and systems.",

        "abstract": "The Army needs high power light sources for high speed photography.  The cameras with frame rates of million frames/sec are increasingly being used for recording of fast events such as the impact of an explosion on an MRAP(Mine Resistant Ambush Protected)  vehicle. Princeton Optronics proposes a solid-sate IR laser illuminator design based on the VCSEL (Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Laser) technology to record such events. In phase I of the SBIR we developed an illuminator to demonstrate the feasibility of developing a compact, high intensity illuminator using VCSEL technology. We propose to develop a low cost and free standing illumination source emitting&gt;2kW total power around 808nm in phase II. Its unique design, packaging and output laser beam would satisfy the Army requirements for application of MRAP vehicle illumination.     The package design developed for the phase I prototype will be scaled up for the phase II higher power prototype. We have also performed the design optimization in terms of VCSEL chip size, the number of VCSEL chips, beam delivery optics and thermal management, etc. We have completed the fabrication and demonstration of the illuminator prototype. The output beam shows a uniform light intensity distribution and divergence of 82 degree full angle. The prototype is capable delivering over 150W of power at room temperature (~20C) and over 100W at the elevated temperature (46C). The performance exceeds the Army&quot;s power specification of 70W for the early version of the prototype.      In Phase II, we will complete the design and fabrication of the illuminator as well as its battery powered control and driver circuit. We will develop a novel high gain quantum well technology for the VCSELs arrays to be used in the illuminator to improve its power performances. We will also deploy a new method of thermal management to efficiently dissipate the heat. At the end of Phase II project, a live demonstration will be performed at Army testing facility. The illuminator will be operated at Army specified conditions to enable high speed filming at 1us exposure.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The overarching objective for this project is to develop a validated analysis tool to predict the behavior of damaged and repaired honeycomb sandwich structures.  The primary objective for  the proposed Phase II effort will be to develop a prototype design environment  for a fully parametric, calibrated and validated, honeycomb sandwich structure damage and repair evaluation design environment using multiple capabilities of StressCheck and a Design OF Experiments approach to calibration, validation, and verification of the analytical models.  This analytical tool will demonstrate the feasibility of a multi-scale, FEA-based, design and analysis tool capable of evaluating the various details of typical honeycomb sandwich structure at a scale that is adequate for each detail of interest.  A test program, based upon the widely adopted and accepted building block format, will be used to perform two main functions.  The first function will be to supply relevant and unique coupon and element level test data that will be used to calibrate the FEA-based analysis models.  The second function will be to generate higher level (element and sub-component) test data to validate the analysis tools over the entire realm of the design space over which the tool is expected to be deployed.  BENEFIT:  Following the success of the Phase II prototype development effort, the design environment developed in Phase II can be made available for initial deployment for evaluation and improvement.  Involvement of initial users can be leveraged to accelerate the development and expansion of the capabilities of the tool in parallel with the Phase III effort.   When brought to fruition in Phase II, the end result will be a calibrated and validated analytical design environment prototype that can be widely deployed among the dispersed engineering teams on any given program.  It will be capable of addressing in a parametric fashion, multiple types of damage and failure, along with subsequent repairs.  This initial set of configurations will allow engineering teams to investigate a wide range of damage and repair scenarios.     The design environment developed in Phase II will be structured as a modular, multi-scale, and expandable tool.  Customers will be able to integrate this tool within their existing analytical framework in a complementary manner.  It will incorporate a fully parametric formulation for every aspect of the inputs and outputs of the 3D solid element, ply-by-ply FEA models that will allow for encapsulation and automation of the entire set of analytical steps required to fully evaluate any given range of configurations.  This will also allow the user to capture every relevant detail that may have an effect on the evaluation.  The Phase II test effort will provide a good foundation for determining a standardized methodology for calibrating and validating analytical models such that they can be trusted to yield accurate results over the entire segment of the design space that they are configured to evaluate.  This approach will open up the entire feasible design space for use by the engineer.",

The goal of Phase II will be to develop our CNT RF FET T-gate device into a manufacturable prototype with improved capabilities beyond the state of the art with respect to linearity and power dissipation. Within Phase I our team fabricated T-gate based RF devices/circuits achieving device cut-off frequencies of 20GHz with unity power gain of 10GHz which is the highest reported extrinsic performance of CNT RF device report in the public domain. In Phase II, we will improve our large signal device model to include linearity and noise components. This will allow optimization of CNT FET design, leading to CNT FET RF circuit design and implementations. Our fabrication approach consists of fabricating supporting/peripheral CMOS passives  and integrating our&quot;in-house&quot;CNT as a post-CMOS process. Our characterization will obtain linearity results such as IIP3, OIP3, as well as noise performance.  BENEFIT:  A key driver of this project aims at improving unmanned aircraft electronics systems. Given the use of high powered RF systems that includes various data links, command and control communications, RF sensors, radar and line of sight and beyond line of sight sensors and communications, much improvement in increased battery life and increased flight time can be obtained by use of CNT RF FET devices. Furthermore, such motivational factors are relevant for all military mobile communication and&quot;electronic heavy&quot;equipment units such as the soldier (lighter communication handheld devices) and naval equipment (lighter &amp; more mobile). Advances from this proposal have the potential to revolutionize the $60 billion analog and mixed signal semiconductor markets. In particular, this technology will directly impact critical RF front end components used in state-of-the-art transceiver architectures. Superior low power and highly linear device will impact the following market segments:   Low-Noise Amplifiers (LNAs)  RF amplifiers primarily used in communication systems to amplify weak signals captured by an antenna.   Broadband Amplifiers  RF amplifiers with a flat response over a wide range of frequencies.  RF Power Amplifiers  RF amplifiers that convert a low-power radio frequency signal into a larger signal for driving the antenna of a transmitter.

For hardware, we designed a thin, small size , light weight onboard DOA hardware system with very low power consumption equipped with fast signal capture capability (within 200ms). The designed DOA receiver has high dynamic range  and can cover a very wide frequency range at min power consumption(A typical 1200mWh battery can support over 5 hour flight mission with 11800 DOA estimations ). For the software part, we have developed the smart antenna calibration, hierarchical delay and sum (DAS) DOA estimation, and terrain data aided DOA fusion 3D localization. We also constructed a 3D simulation and visualization tool by integrating the hardware design, signal processing software algorithms, and UAS flight controls. With a real terrain map, we conducted the simulation and obtained the desired results of 100m accuracy. The system can track dual targets within a second in a typical application and may take a few more seconds in a difficult condition. In Phase II, we plan to coordinate with government POCs and industrial partners on research and development.

Improved robustness and effectiveness will be evident through (1) reduced loading onthe downstream post processor due to the ionomer\u00bfs unique property of selective permeability, (2) near complete removal of water from wastewater, and (3) inclusion of a backup barrier between the retentate and permeate.  The technology offers simplification over existing technology through (1) a lower dependency on moving parts, and (2) integrated capture of wastewater solutes for disposal.  Phase 1 testing showed that 99% of the contaminants in concentrated pretreated urine ersatz were removed by the proposed technology and virtually complete dewatering of the brine was achieved in a configuration that would appear to be insensitive to gravity and orientation.  As the technology is fully developed, it can be inserted into existing and/or developing water recovery system architectures to increase water recovery rates beyond that currently available to date.

To support this activity, the Marines' Combat Hunter program trains \"profiling\", a set of skills used by military and civilian experts to read people and their interactions in complex environments. However, the Combat Hunter program has several critical limitations; it lacks throughput capacity, performance measures, and scientific grounding.  Solution: Aptima has developed a prototype capability to address these limitations. IMPACTS is a multi-media software system that provides Marines with profiling education, and exercises identifying cues in still imagery. Enhancements to IMPACTS will enable the collection of trainee performance data to diagnose skill deficiencies, provide diagnostic feedback for improving performance, and select subsequent IMPACTS training activities. These capabilities will support pre-training preparation (before live classes), training evaluation, and increase training throughput for the acquisition of critical combat profiling skills. IMPACTS will be developed to support several ongoing Navy and Marine Corps efforts, including Small Unit Decision Making (SUDM), the Infantry Small Unit Leaders Course (ISULC), and the Perceptual Training Systems and Tools (PercepTS) program.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Military aircraft tires must handle extreme loads during landing, take-off and taxi. New designs must be evaluated to determine if they meet mission capability requirements. A key evaluation area is the distribution of normal and shear forces in the tire contact patch. These data are critical for understanding tire performance, tire/landing gear interactions, and as inputs to tire wear and failure models. Current technologies suffer from issues such as providing only discrete measurements, providing only pressure data, or being difficult/expensive to calibrate. Our solution employs an elastic film that deforms under the action of applied loads. The deformation of the film is optically monitored. The deformation is modeled using finite element analysis in order to reconstruct the applied loads. The result is a continuous measurement of pressure and shear forces over the film surface. Also needed are technologies that can be transitioned to the flight line for rapid, machine-based detection of pressure loss, and external/internal damage that currently require hours of maintenance labor. The elastic film approach addresses this requirement based on the detection of changes in contact patch size, as well as local anomalies in the pressure and shear patterns produced by external or internal damage.  BENEFIT:  The tire shear and force sensor will directly improve Air Force internal testing capability with payoffs in safety of flight, tire wear and failure prediction, and more cost-effective inspection schedules. It will have broad commercial appeal to aircraft, automobile, truck, and heavy equipment tire manufacturers and testers. Development of a&quot;roll-over&quot;damage inspection capability would lead to significant reductions in flight line and depot maintenance hours",

        "abstract": "Surface vessel detection and classification from airborne platforms relies heavily on radar at operationally useful stand off ranges. Upon detection the radar search waveform may be used to accrue additional information about the surface contact for classification but confidence is likely to be insufficient. Improved classification confidence can be gained by follow-on contact interrogation with high range resolution (HRR) waveforms from different look directions. However, the use of HRR waveforms requires increased processing and possibly increased dwell time depending on the HRR waveform characteristics, and how it is integrated with the search function. If HRR interrogation of the contact cannot provide the desired classification confidence, the radar can employ inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) operation at favorable geometries to further improve classification requiring additional increases in dwell time and processing, and the likely interruption of the search operation. In addition to the stand-alone radar sensor products for classification, EO/IR imagery can be used to augment and possibly improve ISAR imagery, subject to suitable geometry and atmospheric conditions. This process of surface vessel classification consumes increasing radar resources, and traditionally takes place with an operator in the loop commanding the radar modes and using visual tools to perform the classification. The functional integration, capability and sophistication of the operator interface and the associated toolset is an important area of increasing development and critical to the successful use of the suite of sensors available to the operator. NAVSEA has recognized the importance of this interface and associated tool set, and they have funded the development of a powerful capability under the Ocean Surveillance Initiative (OSI). OSI is a capable modular architecture with multiple operator-in-the-loop interfaces implied throughout the architecture, and multiple displays to provide an integrated tactical picture of the maritime environment. However, there is virtually no automatic mode or sensor resource management (RM), and no automatic maritime classification aids (MCA).

        "abstract": "Proliferation of the weapons of mass destruction such as nuclear weapons is a serious threat.\nPrevention of their spread has reached a state of heightened urgency in recent years. One of the\nways to passively determine the presence of nuclear weapons is to detect and identify\ncharacteristic signatures of highly enriched uranium and weapons grade plutonium. Neutrons\nand gamma rays are two signatures of these materials. Gamma ray detection techniques are\nuseful because the presence of gamma rays of specific energies can confirm the presence of a\nparticular isotope. This technique however, has one significant limitation. In the presence of a\ndense surrounding material such as lead, gamma ray attenuation can be significant. This can\nmask the gamma ray signatures of these special nuclear materials (SNM). Neutrons, on the other\nhand, easily penetrate dense and high atomic number materials. For heterogeneous or dense\nmaterials such as samples of metals, oxides, and nuclear waste, gamma ray attenuation is too\nhigh to permit accurate correction of the measured signal. Under these circumstances, passive\nassay techniques based on neutron detection are preferable. When detected, neutrons directly\nindicate the presence of spontaneously fissioning isotopes (plutonium and californium) and\ninduced fissions (uranium). Therefore, neutron detection is an important component of the\noverall detection techniques used in identifying SNM.\nIn radioisotope identification devices to date, the neutron detection was readily achieved\nusing He-3 tubes. Unfortunately, in recent years the quantity of this gas is becoming limited,\ntherefore, new solutions are required for an efficient detection system that would allow neutron\ndetection with an ability to discriminate gamma ray events from neutron events. Gamma\ndiscrimination is critical because gamma rays are common background in neutron detection\nenvironment during SNM monitoring.\nIn this project we propose a handheld thermal neutron detector based on a Cs2LiYCl6:Ce\n(CLYC) scintillator [Combes, van Loef], which is an ideal candidate for the task [Bessiere,\nGlodo 08, Glodo 09]. CLYC offers (1) efficient thermal neutron detection (higher per-volume\nthan He-3); (2) excellent separation between gamma and neutron particles (better than 10-6); and\n(3) gamma-ray energy resolution as good as 4% at 662 keV for dual mode (neutron and gamma)\ndetectors. The last property is very fortunate, since the majority of current handheld thermal\nneutron detectors include a separate gamma detector. In most cases, in addition to neutron\ncounts the detection system should provide information about the dose rate and / or simple\nisotope characterization based on four categories \u2013 NORM (Natural occurring radiation\nmaterials), SNM (Special nuclear materials), Medical and Industrial Radio-nuclides. The good\ngamma ray energy resolution of CLYC should guarantee an accurate energy compensated dose\nrate and reliable characterization of gamma ray radiation. In the last couple of years, CLYC\nmanufacturing has progressed and 1 and 2 inch crystals are being routinely grown at RMD for\ninternal and government purposes [Higgins]. Crystals with diameter as large as 3 inch have been\ngrown. Moreover, the CLYC technology is currently being transferred by RMD to a commercial\nsetting (Hilger), where full scale manufacturing of these crystals will take place.The final goal of this effort is to develop a handheld thermal neutron detector utilizing CLYC\nscintillators. In Phase I of the project we provided strong foundations for achieving this goal.\nWe have shown that CLYC works well with silicon photomultipliers (MPPC from Hamamatsu).\nA CLYC/MPPC system provides a very compact device due to small size of this light detector.Built detectors showed clear neutron peaks (7% energy resolution), were capable of pulse shape\ndiscrimination, and could easily provide dose equivalent information for gamma ray radiation.\nSuch combination works even if the crystal is in a form of a 1 in right cylinder, although pillar\ntype geometry was found to be optimal from the efficiency point of view. Due to their optimal\nsurface to volume ratio, our pillar detectors provided twice as many counts as a high pressure\nHe-3 tube per volume unit.\nThe objective of the Phase II effort is to design and construct prototypes of a compact\nneutron detector based on the CLYC scintillator. The Phase II work will be based on the Phase I\nexperiments and results. It will focus on developing the detector and instrumentation technology\nto achieve the project goal of designing and prototyping a compact handheld neutron detector.\nThe main areas of research and development will include (1) detector module optimization, such\nas detector form factor, light readout, and interface; (2) study of the detector signal shape and\nPSD performance as a function of the temperature and temperature stabilization of the system;\n(3) electronic module design and prototype development. Our goal will be to develop and realize\na concept that can be expanded into multi-component systems, e.g. backpack implementation.\nIn this project we will collaborate with Dr. Sara Pozzi at the University of Michigan. She\nwill assist with the modeling and optimization of the neutron and gamma ray response of our\ndetectors. The optimization will include detector and moderator dimensions.",

Unfortunately, this makes gamma-ray\nspectroscopy systems based on HPGe detectors quite cumbersome, increases their cost, and\nmakes them not readily portable.\nRoom temperature semiconductors include detector materials such as cadmium telluride\n(CdTe) and cadmium zinc telluride (CZT). These detectors operate at room temperature and with\nunipolar charge sensing designs with 3-D correction, they can provide high-energy resolution\n(1 MeV).\nWith respect to the crystal growth aspects, all three compositions have melting points well\nbelow 1000\u00b0C (see Table 1) but only BaBrI:Eu and CsBa2I5:Eu melt congruently while\nCsBaI3:Eu appears to melt incongruently. This implies that large single crystals of BaBrI:Eu and\nCsBa2I5:Eu can be grown relatively easily by melt based crystal growth techniques such as\nvertical Bridgman method. In contrast, the growth of CsBaI3:Eu would require techniques that\nsupport phase formation below its melting such as flux growth or ceramic consolidation. Note\nthat for operating temperature below 1000\u00b0C standard crystal growth equipment can be used that\nis fitted with low-cost SiC or Nichrome heating elements and type K thermocouples. Higher\nmelting temperatures would have required more expensive MoSi heating elements in\ncombination with platinum thermocouples.\nBased on these considerations, we believe that BaBrI:Eu and CsBa2I5:Eu are the most\nattractive scintillation materials for gamma-ray spectroscopy studies (of the three compositions).\nAs a result, the goal of the proposed Phase II effort is to grow large diameter (>1\u201d) BaBrI:Eu and\nCsBa2I5:Eu crystals using the vertical Bridgman technique. Subsequently, the scintillation\nproperties of BaBrI:Eu and CsBa2I5:Eu will be characterized. Based on the results of the 1st year\neffort, we will select the composition that appears to be more promising for further optimization\nand scale-up in the 2nd year of the Phase II effort. Finally, detector units employing the selected\ncrystal material will be built and tested.\nDr. Stephen Derenzo and Dr. Edith Bourret-Courchesne of Lawrence Berkeley National\nLaboratory (LBL) will participate in the characterization of these new scintillators in the Phase II\neffort on a fee-for-service basis.",

It is based on a high fidelity Fatigue Damage Assessment Network (FDAN) which includes 1) a coupled continuum damage and discrete crack model for ply damage characterization; 2) a moment schema finite element coupled with XFEM for efficient crack growth simulation in a thin ply; 3) a mixed mode fatigue delamination module to account for the mode mixity and failure mode interaction; and 4) an adaptive fracture process zone model for mesh independent delamination growth. A reduced-order model of FDAN will be generated using a combined response surface and a Gaussian process surrogate model builder to perform the subsequent probabilistic analysis efficiently.  For the module verification and validation, experimental studies at the sub-component level will be performed along with the use of a damage monitoring and characterization system.

FAUST utilizes CPISync, an advanced data set reconciliation (or data base synchronization) primitive developed at Boston University that provides information-theoretic guarantees on communication complexity. This primitive will have a great impact on improving network performance by enabling larger aggregation of data (scalability), higher rates of data collection during link failures and efficient utilization of low bandwidth data links. It significantly improves the synchronization and transmission of different types of Situational Awareness (SA) information among nodes using common SA platforms such as FBCB2. In Phase I, SSCI demonstrated FAUST offers performance improvements over baseline standard data synchronization mechanisms for ordered data such as flooding or epidemic dissemination. The demonstration was performed using a virtual network, and metrics such as SA picture quality, communication latency, volume of data synchronized per unit time were used for comparison. Phase II will continue this work by enabling user self management in the field, such as allowing the users to select the groups that it belongs to. It will also provide improved recovery mechanisms for failed synchronizations, data prioritization and more efficient many-to-many synchronization mechanisms. A demonstration of two scenarios involving several nodes, an SA picture synchronization scenario and a mission planning scenario, will be developed using tablet devices running Android.",

During this Phase II project, American Testing Services and its subcontractor, Mound Laser and Photonics Center, Inc. will collaborate to develop and produce a comprehensive set of specimens for a low cost, adaptable, and reproducible POD test kit.  MLPC will produce the defects utilizing laser micromachining. ATS and MLPC will post process the defects to mask them from visual detection.  ATS will use NDT techniques to verify the suitability of each specimen for POD testing and training.  At the end of the project, ATS will be in a position to supply an arbitrary number of matching POD test kits to the Air Force on a demand basis.  BENEFIT:  Commercial benefits include test kits with manufactured defects that are more representative of defects found on in-service aircraft which will provide the opportunity to maximize POD. Additionally, test kits will be designed to overlap NDT methods such that one test kit can be used for multiple inspection disciplines. This will reduce the cost and lead time associated with POD studies.",

The process is tedious, time consuming, and does not respond to unexpected situations quickly.

The new measurement data system consists of two parts; a glove-like surface treatment that contains the pressure measurement devices and wires passing to a recording device on the moving rotor blade (or wing) and a rotating data acquisition and storage system.  Recovery of high quality data measured in the fixed frame is accomplished by downloading to a portable computer after the rotor is stopped.  This simple but novel approach ensures high data quality at low cost because the system is adaptable to existing rotors and wings, without extensive modification of rotor blades.

Due to the wide number of threat channels and intrusion modalities, innovative approaches on anti-tamper (AT) sensor technology are needed to counter a capable adversary with a strong reverse-engineering technology base.  DoD is focused on the development of zero-power AT sensor technologies for use at the printed circuit board level or integrated circuit level.  Here the motivation is to detect intrusion prior to product teardown where an adversary can perform system level analyses and extract CPI.  Since military hardware will typically be enclosed in a tamper-proof container or encapsulation, an adversary will need to develop a&quot;depot&quot;strategy to extract the circuit board and/or on-board CPI components while avoiding or negating AT hardware at the packaging level.  This is typically accomplished with a non-destructive scan using x-ray, focused-ion or electron beam analysis.  New non-destructive imaging techniques are emerging that can defeat these beam-like AT mechanisms.

Phase II will further develop MUSTER technical concepts and algorithmic approaches that were initially established during Phase I; will demonstrate their performance with experimental data; and, will address real-time prototyping aspects. The ultimate goal of Phase II is to demonstrate a multi-platform signal tracking architecture (which is the key technological enabler of MUSTER) that can operate in degraded GPS signal environments in real-time. This demonstration will a) mature the core MUSTER capability into the state ready for transitioning to a development program; and b) produce development tools that can be efficiently utilized for prototyping of the other aspects of the MUSTER technology.  BENEFIT:  The proposed multi-platform receiver technology has a significant potential for both DOD applications and a private sector. Example DOD applications include indoor search and rescue; multi-platform surveillance and reconnaissance with teams of autonomous aerial and ground vehicles; and, groups of solders with hand-held GPS receivers. The highest commercialization potential for the private sector will be achieved by bringing the technology to the consumer market of location-based services and personal navigation devices. In addition, the development of MUSTER directly correlates with other DOD programs that research and develop multi-agent collaborative applications. Many of the prospective collaborative missions will occur in environments that are difficult for navigation such as urban and under interference. MUSTER will equip multi-platform agents with precise GPS-based navigation capabilities (including relative and absolute localization) in such challenging conditions.",

This makes it difficult to process experiment data when a phenomenon of interest spans multiple sensors.  There is a clear need for a new software tool that can process sequences of sensor imagery in disparate formats and produce a time sequence of data accurately resampled to a common grid.  We demonstrated end-to-end processing performance: 1) cross-sensor spatial registration via scene-based methods; 2) temporal upsampling to common time base via optical flow interpolation; and 3) advanced&quot;fused&quot;image products (e.g. pan sharpened imagery).  Our proposed Phase II effort will culminate in a functional prototype software tool.

This prototype will ingest common format data sets and produce industry standard output data products, including ENVI-compatible data files and standard image and video format imagery (e.g. JPEG, MPEG).  This product is intended to demonstrate the capabilities and provide a lead-in to development of custom solutions.

        "abstract": "Individual differences in vulnerability to sleep loss and fatigue from extended work hours and night work are a substantial problem in transportation policy making, work schedule development, fatigue risk management strategies, and prediction of performance impairment in real-world operations (Van Dongen\net al. 2003; Mollicone et al. 2010). Our group was the first to document the considerable magnitude of individual differences in vulnerability to the adverse consequences of fatigue (Van Dongen et al. 2004).\nWe also demonstrated that individual differences are a biological trait, which means they are predictable (Van Dongen et al. 2005). Moreover, we showed that individual differences are as relevant in operational settings as they are in the laboratory (Van Dongen et al. 2006). Subsequently, we were the first to develop\na mathematical methodology to predict performance deficits due to fatigue in individual subjects (Van Dongen et al. 2007). The overarching objective of this project (through Phase II) is to translate this basic and applied research into an Individualized Fatigue Management Program (FMP) system for the commercial trucking industry that accounts for individual differences in vulnerability to fatigue stressors\nto improve schedule development and manage driver fatigue and crash risk.\nAt the heart of our approach to achieve an individualized FMP tool for trucking is a state-of-the-art alertness prediction model, which we will individualize using our proprietary closed-loop, Kalman filterbased algorithms (Mollicone 2009; Mott et al. 2009). This approach is based on our previously published Bayesian approach (Van Dongen et al. 2007). The individualized alertness model is used to predict future\nperformance of a given individual. Simultaneously, the current, actual level of performance of the individual will be measured by capturing data from the trucking instrumentation. Through comparison of the model predictions with actual observations and by use of Bayesian optimization, the parameters of the alertness model will be updated so it is optimally tailored for the individual at hand. The alertness model\nwill also take into account estimates of sleep/wake history from wrist actigraphy (a validated tool for estimating sleep time) (Kerkhof and Van Dongen 1996). Figure 1 provides an overview of our approach that involves collecting and integrating two primary data streams: (1) recent driver sleep patterns (e.g.,from actigraphy or sleep diaries); and (2) a real-time metric validated to track the biological fatigue status\nof the driver (e.g., PERCLOS) to individualize fatigue traits. Driver fatigue traits are instantiated in the system as individual-specific, fatigue-related model parameters such as \u201csensitivity to night driving\u201d, or \u201csensitivity to long periods of wakefulness\u201d. The primary data stream is augmented with one or more secondary data streams to additionally track the effect of driver fatigue on vehicle performance (e.g., lane\ntracking accuracy). The secondary data streams helps to achieve a robust system that captures interindividual differences in how fatigue affects actual vehicle performance (not just driver fatigue) and continually \u201cself-validates\u201d by tracking the extent to which measures of driver fatigue and vehicle performance are convergent. Through this process, the FMP tool is able to generate estimates about current and future fatigue and driver performance levels to achieve a system that can be used to improve\nschedule development and route planning, assist in the delivery of fatigue countermeasures, and be uplinked to headquarters for telemonitoring.",

Inverted Metamorphic Multi-junction (IMM) solar cells can enable these arrays, offering higher efficiencies of&gt;33% and lower mass and flexibility, but integration challenges of this thin crystalline cell technology need solution.  The Thin Hybrid Interconnected Solar-Array (THINS) technology allows robust and reliable integration of IMM cells into a flexible blanket comprising standardized modules engineered for producibility.  The modules support the IMM cell by using multi-functional materials for structural stability, shielding, CTE stress relief, and integrated thermal and electrical functions. The Phase I effort demonstrated the feasibility of key THINS component, including the structurally stabilized IMM cell, and integration with advanced multi-functional substrate and superstrate components, and completed the modularity approach for interfacing into the Roll Out Solar Array (ROSA) deployable structure, while improving standardization and manufacturability. Design evaluation shows figures of merit for array level specific power, including deployable structure, greater than 400W/kg and volumetric efficiency greater than15kW/m^3, significantly higher than current approaches. The low mass and low stowed volume provides a path to package 300kW in a single launch with a deployment approach that uses simple, robust mechanisms.  Phase II advances the THINS/ROSA technology, incorporating advanced  4 -Junction IMM solar cells into THINS modules using demonstrated spaceflight qualified materials, testing module coupons in thermal cycling and plasma environments, fabricating a full-scale module to demonstrate automatable manufacturing processes, integrating that module and inactive modules (with cell simulators) into the ROSA deployable structure, and culminating in a full-scale deployment demonstration.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The goal of the Phase II SBIR project is to develop a practical valve health monitoring system for control valves that are utilized at AEDC facilities.  The technical problem addressed is the impact of unplanned valve maintenance or valve failure on wind tunnel operations at AEDC.  Valve issues include but are not limited to leakage, loose linkages, faulty sensors, worn valve bearings, and jammed seats.  The system will gather and analyze valve control signals to diagnose, predict, and prioritize potential failures using algorithms investigated during Phase I and finalized during Phase II.  The system will also be capable of taking advantage of optional sensors, if available, such accelerometers, pressure transducers, and temperature sensors. An interactive Graphical User Interface will guide the user through the data collection and analysis process.  The system will determine readiness of valves and will characterize faults, help prioritize maintenance, and predict remaining useful life of valves and valve components.  The Phase I effort was guided by a Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA), a finite element analysis, and extensive testing.  System feasibility was demonstrated, and the prospects are excellent for delivering a useful prototype valve monitoring system at the conclusion of the Phase II project.  BENEFIT:  Successful implementation of the valve heath monitoring algorithms will have significant use in both military and commercial facilities such as power plants, refineries, water treatment plants, and general industry. While many commercial companies focus on rotating machinery health management systems, the same effort in the valve area is lacking, and would be particularly useful for valves in the refining and  power industries.",

        "abstract": "There is great current interest in improving the contact management of submarines operated in the littorals.  Littoral contact management is challenging because the ambiguities inherent in contact localization make accurately reconstructing each contact a hard task. High littoral contact densities exacerbate the problem. Knowledge about contacts may become unhelpfully fragmented across the submarine team and there can be critical failures of the team mental model. In Phase I, PSE designed a concept prototype of a Team Assessment Grid (TAG) to support submarine littoral contact management. The TAG supports the team mental model by making the contact management processes explicit and verifiable. TAG applies scientific concepts from cognitive and collaboration science, tailored to a sophisticated understanding of domain requirements to create a simple, useful and usable tool for the section tracking party. In Phase II, PSE proposes to design, develop and validate a demonstration concept demonstration prototype of the TAG system, with both human performance testing and modeling and simulation. The TAG will improve the cognitive readiness of contact management teams by improving task performance, shared situation awareness and convergence of the team mental model. The project culminates in a whitepaper to NAVSEA to transition TAG through APB15.",

New methods of enhancing TE efficiency are needed and have been realized through structural alteration of TE materials. Modifying this approach, Mainstream has achieved as high as a 5-fold increase in the effective performance of thermoelectric materials during Phase I. Maintaining this improvement within a full-scale thermoelectric device will lead to at least a 2.5-fold increase in power conversion efficiency. During Phase II, Mainstream will demonstrate ultra-high efficiency TE power generation with an overall system weight that is less than 1.5 kg/kW (3.3 lbs/kW). Mainstream will also demonstrate the observed enhancement with moderate- and high- temperature thermoelectric materials as well as develop circuit- and system- level manufacturing methods for the high efficiency TE generator. Further refinement of Mainstream&quot;s innovative and low-cost approach will lead to even higher zT values and greater efficiencies. In preparation for transition to military and commercial platforms, Mainstream will also concurrently develop aircraft interfaces and system level integration.",

        "abstract": "The defense community is extremely interested in developing numerical methodologies for predicting the dynamic response of concrete materials under extreme loading conditions. This capability would make it possible to use computer software for simulating events of interest, such as the response of concrete structures or structural components to blast and fragment impact. Over the years, substantial effort has been invested in researching analytical models and methods to develop this capability. Most of this effort has focused on in improving methodologies that are based on continuum mechanics. However, (classical) continuum mechanics is not well suited for the simulation of concrete in the post-failure regime. This is mainly due to the non-homogenous nature of concrete as well as the discontinuous nature of fracture and fragmentation. To overcome these limitations, ES3 and Prof. Cusatis at RPI have jointly formulated and implemented a new innovative methodology: the Lattice Discrete Particle Model (LDPM). LDPM is a methodology that treats concrete at the meso-scale, the scale of the largest aggregate pieces. LDPM models the heterogeneities in concrete and is capable of simulating discrete cracking leading to fragmentation in a physically realistic fashion. In Phase I, we have demonstrated how LDPM can be integrated in a multi-scale computational environment. Furthermore, we have shown the feasibility of treating accurately concrete-fiber and concrete-rebar interactions. In Phase II, we are planning to Extend the Bridging-Scale Methods (BSM) to a three-dimensional framework where the fine scale solution is provided by LDPM. Validate the concrete-fiber interaction algorithm for CORTUF. Perform tests in support of the validation effort for the concrete-fiber interaction algorithm. Perform simulations of CORTUF panel penetrations. Create a library of examples and supporting documentation.",

Deriving actionable information from test data is a challenging task due to lack of software that automatically correlates test measurement data obtained from failing ICs and their physical IC-design description (i.e., the layout). Maximizing knowledge extraction is accomplished by a new software-based diagnosis technique that uses in conjunction the logical and layout descriptions, in addition to the measured test data, to identify at the nanometer scale, the precise location and type of defects within non-working ICs. The project also develops software-based statistical methods that find commonalities among the defects characterized within failing ICs. The combination of improved diagnosis and commonality analyses means that the root-causes for failure can be quickly found and passed on to designers, process engineers, and test engineers to guide remedy selection and deployment. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project centers on continuing the advancement of the US semiconductor industry which is vital to both Homeland Security and the general advancement of society as a whole. There is significant commercial opportunity in supplying test data analysis on a per-design basis to Integrated Circuit (IC) producers that enables rapid improvement in yield and quality through feedback from manufacturing testing. The potential impact is tremendous since specific, pertinent information is fed back to both designers and manufacturers about how and why ICs fail. Chip designers will use this information to improve design rules for producing high-yielding and ultra-reliable ICs. Chip manufacturers will use this information to fine-tune their fabrication processes to maximize yield and performance, and optimize their test methodologies to ensure quality meets customer demands.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on coupling sound to the human ear for communications devices (MP3, Bluetooth, hearing aids, headsets, earbuds) with unprecedented comfort, safety and audio quality. A chip-like device, the diaphonic valve, for harvesting energy from audio communications for the purpose of inflating a coupling device (balloon) in the user&#039;s ear has been demonstrated. This inflatable ear coupling mitigates excessive sound pressure levels that often occur within-ear listening devices, such as ear-buds and hearing aids, and which are a cause of audio fatigue and potential hearing damage. Diaphonic valve design has been dramatically improved making it smaller and more effective at pumping air. In this project, production of the critical diaphonic valve-chip component will be increased to a small scale manufacturing level. Additionally, the pressure and power utilization management hardware and algorithms to integrate the diaphonic valve and inflatable ear coupling (bubble) into commercial headsets, and hearing aids will be developed. Finally, work will be done on a non-inflatable ear couple technology, discovered during Phase I of this project, which also improves audio quality and hearing safety. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project centers on revolutionary new person-to-audio couplings, based on an inflatable ear-piece, with applications in consumer audio, Bluetooth headsets, hearing aids, ear-buds, and headsets for professional communications (pilots, law enforcement, military, etc.). This technology has the potential to improve peoples lives by reducing listener fatigue and hearing damage in the population using in-ear devices, as well as making hearing aids more comfortable and better sounding for people who already have hearing loss. Published results from Phase I have shown how existing ear coupling approaches can produce dangerous sound pressures in the ear canal and how the technologies of this project allow ear couplings that alleviate this problem. The first embodiment of this new technology to the market will be a basic version applied to consumer headsets (ear-buds). From there, more complex applications, such as hearing aids, will be addressed. The success of this project will create engineering and business sector jobs as well as manufacturing jobs. The project also includes funding for a high school student or college undergraduate to participate in the research and development activities.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop high-performance transparent conductors as a replacement to Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) in touchscreens. ITO suffers from a number of disadvantages, including being one of the most expensive components of a touchscreen device, complex manufacture, and inflexibility. In this project, a transparent conductor will be developed using solution-based conventional coating equipment. Two key features of this novel transparent conductor are: (1) ease of processing, which eliminates many conventional processing steps involved in coatings; and (2) extreme durability, which enables the creation of next-generation touch devices that are otherwise impossible to realize with ITO or other ITO-alternative materials. The tradeoff between photonic transmission and electronic conduction will be theoretically and experimentally studied by extracting effective optical parameters of transparent conductor films. The printed touchscreen sensors will be integrated into functional multi-touch projected-capacitive devices, which are expected to show mechanical flexibility, higher signal to noise ratios, and faster response times. The broader/commercial impacts of this project will be the potential to enable enhanced performance of touchscreens at disruptively lower costs. The total addressable market of patterned transparent conductor materials for touchscreen industry is about $1.3 billion today. Currently, material and processing costs of ITO represent a growing portion of the bill of materials for touchscreen devices. Transparent conductors to be developed through this project offer low-cost, high-performance, and high production throughput benefits, which will address the ITO-related challenges in touchscreen industry. Other applications of this technology includes liquid crystal displays, organic light emitting diodes, e-paper, flexible displays, thin film photovoltaics, electromagnetic shielding, defrosting windshields, low-emissivity architectural glass, and smart windows.",

To meet this need, Physical Optics Corporation proposes to build and test a Stabilized Laser rangefinder built into a Binocular (SLABIN), with tilt compensation by a feedback loop. In Phase I we proved that the laboratory SLABIN prototype with MEMS mirror-position sensitive detector feedback effectively suppressed jitter introduced by the scanning mirror by up to 20 dB. The feedback loop exhibited high stability at up to 300 Hz. The Phase I demonstration involved integrating SLABIN components with our existing technologies, including laser rangefinders, adaptive optics, electro-optical elements, and design of complex measurement systems. Our Phase II efforts will significantly improve the SLABIN, speeding up the feedback loop (up to 3 kHz), expanding range (to&gt;5 km) and measurement precision (&lt;0.5 m) of target coordinates (&lt;5 m) and speed, adding functions of laser beam divergence compensation, target designation, and wireless data transmission. The Phase II prototype will be integrated with M-25 binoculars and tested in the field to verify that its performance meets the Army need.",

The individual component technologies are well into development, however, the impact of simply adding the subcomponents into a traditional missile structure is a KV assembly with redundant structure.  The objectives of the Phase II program is to integrate MDA-developed critical technologies that will result in a reduced volume and reduced mass kinetic kill vehicle.  The technical innovation is the tailoring of lightweight composite materials into configurations that provide subsystem integration and eliminate the redundant structure.  For this proposal, technologies will be integrated into a prototype KV to address all the functions of the KV including propulsion, electronics and communication antenna packaging directly onto the structural walls, layered radiation hardening of electronics and a sensor assembly that includes seeker electronics and optics packaged on a common mounting surface.  Because the proposed Phase II focus is integrating several technologies, SDC has partnered with other companies to create a critical mass of technologies for integration into a KV assembly.  The goal for the end of the Phase II program is to fabricate and test some functionality of full scale KV subsystems and to demonstrate integration of the subsystem into a prototypical assembly",

Vast amounts of FOQA data are distributed between many computers, organizations, and geographic locations. This project develops methodology for transforming such distributed data into actionable knowledge in application to aircraft health management from the vehicle level to the fleet level to the national level. The distributed data processing methodology provably obtains the same results as would be obtained if the data could be centralized. The data mining methods are efficient and scalable so that they can return results quickly for 10Tb of distributed data.This data mining technology that we call Distributed Fleet Monitoring (DFM) developed in SBIR Phase I satisfies these requirements. The data are transformed into models, trends, and anomalies. The model training and anomaly monitoring are formulated as convex optimization and decision problems. The optimization agents are distributed over networked computers and are integrated through remote connection interface in a scalable open grid computing framework. Though the data and the computations are distributed, they yield provably the same optimal solution that would be obtained by a centralized optimization.DFM feasibility was demonstrated in the problem of monitoring aircraft flight performance from fleet data using large realistic simulated datasets. We demonstrated efficient computation of quadratic optimal solution by interacting distributed agents. The feasibility demonstration successfully recovered aircraft performance anomalies that are well below the level of the natural variation in the data and are not directly visible. The algorithms are very efficient and scalable. Phase I demonstration extrapolates to processing 10Tb of raw FOQA data in under an hour to detect anomalous units, abnormal flights, and compute predictive trends.",

In addition, Intelliface will reduce the effort needed to integrate diagnosis and planning systems.Intelliface will encode and apply a qualitative understanding of generic types of devices and their underlying physics (e.g., electrical storage, distribution, and consumption; fluid flow and storage; signal processing, etc.) in order to identify each activity&#039;s direct and indirect resource requirements and their dependencies. Intelliface will use the results of this reasoning to generate resource declarations, updated resource availabilities, and some planning constraints in the planning domain modeling language. In addition, Intelliface will support NASA&#039;s top-down systems engineering processes for specifying system functional requirements, performance requirements, and interfaces at each system tier.During Phase 2, we will develop a technology readiness level 6 software prototype that demonstrates the feasibility, utility, and usability of the Intelliface concept within a NASA-relevant environment.",

The PowerCube concept integrates three innovative component technologies to provide these capabilities:  First, a Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) water-electrolysis fuel cell supplies gH2/gO2 to a simple pressure-fed thruster to provide 300 Ns of impulse per 100 mL of water. This approach enables the CubeSat to launch with &#039;inert&#039; propellant to comply with P-POD limitations on stored energy and then process the water on-orbit into high-Isp fuel. Second, a deployable solar array that stows along the long sides of the CubeSat and deploys in a &#039;windmill&#039; configuration provides up to 96 W peak. Third, a 3DOF &#039;carpal-wrist&#039; gimbal, in conjunction with magnetic torque coils, enables sun-tracking of the solar panel, vectoring of the thruster, and precision pointing of payloads. The combination of ample power and water electrolysis will provide up to 6 m/s of delta-V per 90 minute orbit for a 3U CubeSat. Compared to other CubeSat propulsion technologies, the PowerCube thruster will enable more rapid orbital maneuvering and significantly lower contamination issues.  Our Phase I effort developed a detailed baseline design for the PowerCube, and built and tested a proof-of-concept prototype of the water-electrolysis thruster.  The Phase II effort will mature the electrolysis thruster component to the engineering model level, develop and simulate methods for attitude control and precise pointing of both panels and payloads using the gimbal and torque coils, and develop a detailed design for the entire PowerCube module to enable flight validation in follow-on Phase III efforts.",

Future aircraft are a natural application of adaptive control. These aircraft will be more fuel efficient, have longer operating ranges though more flexible aircraft structures. This increased flexibility will tightly couple structural and rigid body modes. The traditional control approaches to address the aeroservoelastic (ASE)will not work due to this coupling. Furthermore, the application of adaptive control to these flexible aircraft may result in undesired ASE excitation leading to structural damage or failure. Hence an integrated flight control system is needed for gust load alleviation, flutter suppression and rigid body control of the aircraft which works in concert with the adaptive control system for improved resilience and safety.

The prototype LPV tools will be used to analyze and design an inner-loop LPVASE and adaptive outer-loop controller for the MAD-MUTT test vehicle. The LPV designs will be validated in software-in-the-loop andhardware-in-the-loop testing prior to their implementation and flighttest on the MAD-MUTT vehicle.

        "abstract": "Silicon Carbide deep UV detectors can achieve large gains, high signal-to-noise ratios and solar-blind operation, with added benefits of smaller sizes, lower operating voltages, radiation hardness, ruggedness and scalability. SiC UV APDs implementation is challenging due to some material defects, relatively not-well modeled device operation, and very high absorption coefficients near 200nm wavelengths. The objective of this proposed work is to extend the state-of-the-art in UV sensors by: a) developing SiC deep UV detectors, and b) improving their responsivity down to near 200nm wavelengths. We plan to accomplish this goal by using the SiC UV APD design simulator developed in Phase I, and making further improvements as we introduce new design concepts to improve the responsivity utilizing novel design and fabrication techniques tof the critical n+ top contact layer on the APD to reduce charge recombination in the UV absorption layer.We will develop unique fabrication techniques to improve surface quality of the SiC APD structure. This effort will be led by Auburn University, which has developed state-of-the-art fabrication methodologies and capabilities for SiC MOSFETs, in collaboration with CoolCAD who will design the devices and the implantation process.Our main effort will focus on generating a built-in surface field by creating a steep doping profile right at the surface. Since steep dopant gradients necessary to create a field within 40nm of the surface are not feasible using epitaxial growth techniques for SiC, we will develop implantation and dopant activation sequences, and backend processing techniques to achieve this goal. By creating a field in the deep UV absorption layer (~40nm), we will reduce the initial recombination of electron-hole pairs created by the UV photons and increase current reaching the multiplication region of the APD.",

An enabling technology for these missions is advanced cryocoolers that can provide continuous and distributed cooling with minimal input power.  On this program, Creare proposes to develop and demonstrate an innovative cryocooler that produces refrigeration at temperatures of 30 to 70 K and rejects heat at a temperature of 150 to 210 K with extremely high efficiency.  The heat rejected can be absorbed by an upper stage cryocooler or rejected to space through a small cryo-radiator.  The overall mass of the cryocooler, cryo-radiator and electronics is nominally 6 kg, the area of the cryo-radiator is 0.8 m2 and the input power is significantly less than current state-of-the-art cryocoolers.  The electronics utilize parts that are tolerant to 300 kRad total ionizing dose.  In addition, the cryocooler technology is extremely reliable and scalable, and produces no perceptible vibration.  The key innovation is a cryogenic compressor which has heritage to the cryogenic circulator developed by Creare and operated on the Hubble Space Telescope for 6.5 years.  On the Phase I project, we optimized the cryocooler design for a particular mission class and predicted the performance of the cryocooler using a combination of analyses and component-level test data.  On the Phase II project, we will build and test a demonstration cryocooler and cryo-radiator.

Based on limitations of previous efforts, NASA has requested proposals for a testbed to support CFD validation.  Leveraging the results of the Phase I effort, Near Space Corporation (NSC), proposes to develop and operate two full scale Testbeds (~9 m diameter) in order to help validate CFD models for the TSSM Titan Montgolfiere balloon.

These flights will enable better IR imaging and flow characterization measurements.  The acquired data will provide critical input to incrementally improve and validate the CFD models.  The outdoor drop/inflation test and a free flight test will retire technology risks associated with the future Titan mission in addition to generating the validation data necessary to improve the existing CFD models.

Reservoir cathodes are the only emission sources that are capable of supplying the necessary current density (&gt;5.0 A/cm2) and life (&gt;100,000 hours) for next generation high-power thrusters.  More powerful thrusters are needed for interplanetary and lunar missions, as well as earth escape and near-earth space maneuvers.  Reservoir cathodes are able to sustain high rates of barium diffusion to the cathode surface to overcome the high rate of barium removal in ion engines. The key Phase I innovation was flexible supports for the cathode matrix.  This prevented the matrix fractures and reservoir leaks of previous reservoir cathodes for ion engines.  Cathode operation and stability was verified.  In Phase II,the design is refined and tested in actual ion engines.The key challenge is the stresses exerted on the cathode tube and reservoir due to differential expansion and large temperature excursions.  These originate from the outside heater and also from heating due to collisions with the cathode.  These stresses can lead to fractures and weld failure.  Our innovation solves this problem.  This was proven on the Phase I device.In Phase II we further test and optimize the Phase I device and perform life testing on it.  We build cathode assemblies for insertion into ion engines which we test in an ion environment at e beam, JPL and Colorado State University.  Their maximum specific impulse will be measured.",

This is a challenging problem, since quantities of interest typically can not be directly measured but instead must be inferred. These inferences are made by solving inverse problems, where complex forward models are inverted to estimate parameters of the model. These parameters correspond to physical properties of the environment. Because of the complexity of many forward models, inversion is usually accomplished by minimizing the difference between observations and model predictions through adjustment of model parameters. This minimization process is computationally demanding, since it requires evaluating the forward model many times and minimizing a function of many variables.In this project, we propose to develop, using low-cost high performance hardware accelerators, a fast general-purpose parameter fitting software tool suite for fitting model parameters to observed data. The tool suite will allow NASA scientists to use state of the art high performance computing resources to speed their work. In the Phase I of this project we have shown that the three key components of model fitting, namely model evaluation, gradient calculation and cost functional minimization, can be accelerated using graphical processing unit (GPU) technology.The Phase I work has laid the foundation for Phase II of the project, where the components investigated and developed will be integrated into a parameter fitting tool suite.

These secondary structures must increase utilization of the primary pressurized volumes by accommodating hardware, experiments, storage space, and cable routing.  The expandable structures must use minimal launch mass and volume, be easy to install, and maximize operational volume and structural performance in a crewed or material transfer pressure vessel. Utilizing unique materials and innovative mechanical designs, CTD has created a new class of deployable structures for increasing the utility of inflatable habitats. These new concepts are referred to as Composite Rollable Extendible Slit-Tube Structures, or CRESTS. CRESTS can provide room divisions or load bearing floors and provide mounting for racks, storage and cabling. CRESTS are stowed by rolling slit-tube beams, lateral support battens, and floor or wall surfaces into a single compact tube. CRESTS have been designed for linearly expanding lunar modules and for toroidal inflatable orbital habitats. CRESTS are elastically strained deployable composites that provide a positive deployment force and an inherent geometric lock-out to occur once the deployment is complete.  This technology can address the challenges within this application of being lightweight, yet rigid.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Distributed systems face distributed threats.  These threats can only be countered with a distributed trustworthiness architecture that measures and enforces trust across a network.  In Phase I, Real-Time Innovations (RTI) proposed two different components of trustworthiness: an a priori component, which classifies a node before it joins the network, and a dynamic component, which is updated depending on the node&quot;s behavior while communicating. Based on these models, we proposed a trustworthiness index.  We also identified components needed by an airborne network to compute and enforce the trustworthiness index. We implemented a prototype of a trust agent that computes both the a priori and dynamic trustworthiness indexes.  In Phase II, RTI will further refine the structured assurance case models for both the a priori and dynamic trustworthiness indexes.  We will also implement tools that assess behavioral changes and update the trustworthiness. Finally, we will demonstrate all the provided capabilities on a representative airborne network.  The proposed work will create a practical trust architecture within RTI&quot;s TRL 9 middleware product. RTI will also pursue standardization. The standards-based trustworthiness infrastructure will mitigate the risk of cyber attacks for many real-world applications, including the multi-service MADL airborne network.  BENEFIT:  The Trustworthiness Index infrastructure developed will enable the detection of subtle, complex embedded system software vulnerabilities across collaborative network elements.  As airborne systems become more interconnected, maintaining absolute knowledge and assurance of the sources and recipients of information becomes a virtually impossible task.  Therefore, having a measure of trust becomes an important tool in assessing and managing risk.  The RTI approach has the benefit of flexibility in that multiple parameters can be used dynamically to make decisions and take action based on the trust information.   It provides an additional tier in an overall defense-in-depth security posture.  This project has clear applications both in DoD and commercial markets.  All DoD customers requiring safe-and-secure, standards-based distributed computing can benefit.  However, the avionics, unmanned vehicles, vetronics, cross-domain solutions, and C4ISR communities especially will benefit by having a middleware product suite that provides a foundational building block of trust for implementing heterogeneous distributed architecture concepts.  Multiple DoD Prime contractors have expressed interest in this project and several letters of support from commercial and defense firms are included in this proposal.",

Many large military platforms, such as warships and aircraft, rely on electronic warfare support (ES) systems for self-defense. Platforms conducting missions, such as covert strike, cooperative targeting, and tactical engagement (e.g., anti-surface warfare (ASUW)), also require ES capabilities in addition to those required for self-defense, since they must intercept, identify, and locate or localize emitters of interest. To rapidly and correctly fingerprint sophisticated emitters, we propose to develop and evaluate an ES system classification tool, Electromagnetic Signal Classification Using Ensembles (E-CUE).

Computational complexity of these problems have led investigators to conclude that in many instances, real time solutions are computationally infeasible,  forcing the use of relaxed versions of the problem to manage computational complexity. The primary objective of the proposed research is to accelerate optimization algorithms that play central roles in NASA's ATM research, by parallel implementation on emerging high performance computing (HPC) hardware. \nThe Phase I R&D effort implemented a Simplex-based Dantzig-Wolfe (DW) decomposition solver that exploits both coarse-grain and fine-grain parallelism in the sub-problem and master iterations of the DW decomposition. The implementation also exploits the sparsity in the problems, to manage both memory requirements and run-times for large-scale optimization problems. This parallel implementation was used to solve a Traffic Flow Management (TFM) problem with 17,000 aircraft (linear program with 7 million constraints), in 15 seconds.

Qualtech Systems, Inc., in collaboration with TRACLabs, Inc., proposes developing novel capabilities in the areas of health management, providing information for health and capability-related situational awareness, acquisition of data from onboard systems, and generating and invoking procedures for troubleshooting, restoration of operation, and/or initiating safety assurance processes.",

Phase II will develop a high temperature microsensor array suitable for incorporation in engines, as installed in aircraft.  Sensor arrays developed by our team and research partners have been demonstrated for ground test usage to quantify composition of critical constituents in turbine engine exhaust products, e.g., CO, CO2, NOx, O2 and HC.  To date, our research efforts for exhaust monitoring have focused on ground applications, such as installations in stationary rigs for engine development.  The goal of the proposed program is to build on knowledge accumulated on ground-based systems to develop a flyable prototype.  The program will leverage test opportunities in larger research programs to move through the maturation steps from ground-based to flyable systems.  The microsensor array probe, cabling and control electronics will be developed to withstand the harsh environment of an aircraft engine.

The model will also be validated against acoustic and flowfield data from a realistic jet-pylon experiment, thereby significantly advancing the state-of-the-art for LES.

In a modern gas turbine engine, these temperatures can exceed the blade and disk material limits by 600 \u00bfF or more, necessitating both internal and film cooling schemes in addition to the use of thermal barrier coatings. Internal convective cooling is inadequate in many blade locations, and both internal and film cooling approaches can lead to significant performance penalties in the engine.\n \nMicro Cooling Concepts has developed a turbine blade cooling concept that provides enhanced internal impingement cooling effectiveness via the use of micro-structured impingement surfaces. These surfaces significantly increase the cooling capability of the impinging flow, as compared to a conventional untextured surface. This approach can be combined with microchannel cooling and external film cooling to tailor the cooling capability per the external heating profile.

Second, satellite operations currently use a highly manual approach. The research and development of autonomous operations has been conducted recently but is still at early stage. Third, due to different characteristics of space networks, security management mechanisms and other network management functions that are widely adopted in the traditional networks are not fully suitable to space networks. In addition, several issues related to Bundle Protocol exist and need to be further investigated to enhance the performance of bundle delivery in delay tolerant networks.

Real-time monitoring of this data in nuclear thermal engines would greatly improve operational safety and performance, reduce operational costs, and significantly impact maintenance costs and reliability. Even though some extreme environment sensors become available recently, it is still impossible to directly and accurately measure the critical operational parameters of NTP engines due to the lack of extreme environment electronics for those sensors. Data from extreme environment sensors is delivered via wire-line to an external actively cooled electronics box, where it is processed. This approach presents significant drawbacks such as the need for complex shielded wiring harnesses that not only are heavy but also limit sensor location and signal quality (i.e., signal to noise ratio).

Placing the optical entry surface on the back of the wafer also improves the optical fill since it is no longer be necessary to shine light through the quench resistor network on the front surface of the detector. Lastly, back-thinning the detector wafer significantly reduces the mass per unit area of the focal plane array.\n \nVoxtel has successfully demonstrated the ability to perform wafer-scale back thinning fabrication for superior UV sensitivity.

Currently, a large portion of the mirror stroke must be used to flatten the MEMS DMs. In the case of the large-stroke segmented MEMS DMs manufactured by Iris AO, there is sufficient stroke for wavefront correction after flattening.

This Phase I SBIR will make substantial improvements in the fabrication process of MEMS segmented DMs that reduce the deleterious residual surface-figure errors.

To meet the challenges of these next generation instruments, a new class of high performance electronics needs to be developed.\n\nIn this SBIR Phase II proposal, Mosaix proposes to design and build two separate low power, and  compact single board digital poly-phase Fast Fourier Transform spectrometer (FFTS) optimized for the back-end signal processing requirements of next generation instruments. These two spectrometer designs are targeted to meet different mission requirements and leverage a common FPGA based digital electronic design and spectrometer IP core. Whilst sharing a common architecture, the boards differ in the analog-to-digital (ADC) samplers used at the front-end of the spectrometer and the actual FPGA device used for the digital signal processing tasks. The first spectrometer design is for a 8 GHz bandwidth spectrometer targeted for earth observing (EOS) missions.  The second spectrometer design is for a 750 MHz bandwidth spectrometer targeted for planetary radiometer missions. The spectrometers developed under this SBIR will be state-of-the-art spectrometers.",

In this new generation of smaller, lighter and more affordable coronagraph systems, the starlight is rejected with the aid of phase-based transparent masks capable of transmitting planetary light at small angular separation from the star. These so-called vector vortex waveplates (VVW) are complex optical components wherein the optical axis orientation is azimuthally modulated in space at a high spatial frequency. In the Phase 1 of the project, we showed the feasibility of fabricating VVWs that would meet requirements for astronomy applications due to small singularity size, high topological charge, high contrast, and broadband functionality. The breakthrough polarization conversion and beam shaping technology of printing VVWs developed in the Phase 1 will undergo further fundamental improvements in the Phase 2 of the project along with further optimization of photoalignment materials and liquid crystal polymers to fabricate and deliver VVWs characterized by: subwavelength singularity sizes; spectrally broadband/achromatic functionality, particularly, for infrared wavelengths; stability to radiation and large temperature variations; and functionality at cryogenic temperatures.

The project outcomes include innovative advances in component design and fabrication and substantial progress in development of high-resolution deformable mirrors (DM) suitable for space-based operation. Space-based telescopes have become indispensible in advancing the frontiers of astrophysics. Over the past decade NASA has pioneered coronagraphic instrument concepts and test beds to provide a foundation for exploring feasibility of new approaches to high-contrast imaging and spectroscopy. From this work, NASA has identified a current technology need for compact, ultra-precise, multi-thousand actuator DM devices. Boston Micromachines Corporation has developed microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) DMs that represent the state-of-the-art for scalable, small-stroke high-precision wavefront control. The emerging class of high-resolution DMs pioneered by the project team has already been shown to be compact, low-power, precise, and repeatable. This project will develop a system that eliminates the leading cause of single actuator failures in electrostatically-actuated wavefront correctors \u0096 snap-through instability and subsequent electrode shorting and/or adhesion. To achieve this we will implement two innovative, complementary modifications to the manufacturing process that were proven successful in Phase I. We will develop a drive electronics approach that inherently limits actuator electrical current density generated when actuator snap-down occurs, and we will modify the actuator design to mitigate adhesion between contacting surfaces of the actuator flexure and fixed base electrode in the event of snap-down.

The space station itself has a limited lifecycle as well, thus long-term and/or high-risk development programs pose issues for science 'return on investment', if the technology cannot be adequately matured before the station is decommissioned. Thus innovative systems and technologies that minimize impact on limiting resources such as up-mass, down-mass and crew time, and can do so in the near- to mid-term, are highly desirable. One such area includes the various rechargeable battery systems on ISS used extensively for cameras, camcorders, laptops, communication systems and other portable science and diagnostic equipment.\n \nA common (universal) battery charging system for ISS, with the flexibility to accommodate current and future rechargeable battery requirements for payloads and equipment, could reduce the cost of use of the ISS for payload developers. Such a system would not only simplify the safety and integration process for battery-operated ISS applications, but also reduce up-mass by making use of existing ISS resources. In its SBIR Phase I program, Aurora Flight Sciences laid the groundwork for such a system, based on the needs of current and planned ISS battery system requirements. The results of the study indicate that a universal rechargeable battery system is feasible and could significantly reduce up-mass and crew-time to support current and future ISS programs. Expanding on the feasibility study performed in Phase I, Aurora will deliver a protoflight charger system and supporting documentation at the conclusion of Phase II. The proposed system will be fully developed in compliance with NASA safety and integration criteria within the 2-year SBIR Phase II timeframe, facilitating procurement of flight and ground support hardware by NASA in a potential Phase III program.",

Unfortunately, since many tamper-detection responses involve disabling critical program information, the system designer must establish thresholds that are either set loose enough to not provide an adequate level of security, or are so draconian that the protection becomes a operational liability.  Thus either the tamper detection devices function at crippled levels, or the protected devices suffer from unacceptable failure rates in the field. CATE (Central Anti-Tamper Engine) is effectively a standardized AT decision engine which can be inserted into any number of AT activities to provide an&quot;off-the-shelf&quot;component for monitoring inputs from the various AT sensors.  By using advanced decision engine technology, CATE reduces the risk of false alarms, allowing sensors to be used with stricter response thresholds without risking a compromise of the system while minimizing the device failure rate.  The inputs, their meaning, and their relationships are unique to each AT activity, but the decision engine and supporting tools will be provided as a common platform.  CATE will make powerful decision-making available without exposing root software responsible for creating the network.",

The software design is highly modular, consisting of a flexible user interface linked to a set of hardware-optimized shared-memory Krylov solvers with multigrid and other preconditioners. During Phase I, using a benchmark of interest to the Army, various preconditioner-solver combinations were tested for optimal convergence and solution times, cache-aware data storage formats were examined for scalability, the bottleneck in MCP computing was identified, and the feasibility of a new proposed strategy was demonstrated successfully. For Phase II, the Krylov solvers and preconditioners will be optimized further using a range of information on the underlying MCP hardware. Each software module will be tested rigorously and the integrated system finally validated using applications of interest to the Army. Fast mixed-precision computations, efficient utility of the MCP memory hierarchy and distribution, flexible user interface, and dynamic solver adaptivity characterize the novel contributions of this project to the art of solving variable-coefficient Poisson equations on shared-memory MCPs.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The Department of Defense is actively pursuing the capability to assemble and launch a satellite within days, or even hours, of a battlefield commander&quot;s notification for anticipated needs and within several months to no more than a year for unanticipated needs.  The thermal control systems (TCS) on these satellites currently pose an obstacle to meeting this target.  Thermal insulation blankets are critical to an Operationally Responsive Space (ORS) satellite&quot;s on-orbit performance; yet, due to their fabrication leadtimes and delicacy in installation, they are also one of the critical elements of the TCS that must be addressed to meet ORS&quot;s aggressive vision.  Aspen Aerogels is proposing to finalize the design and demonstrate functionality of a rapid fabrication facility for aerogel thermal insulation that could provide the required on-orbit performance with reliable and robust thermal blankets that can meet the fabrication, assembly, integration and test window required for ORS missions.  In parallel to this effort, the process for preparing the aerogel thermal insulation will be optimized to reduce time and cost.  The end result will be a usable capability to fabricate and install high performance aerogel thermal blankets which could be deployed to ORS integration and test sites around the globe.  BENEFIT:  Anticipated Benefits   This proposal addresses maturation and integration of various operations required for the design, fabrication, and installation of encapsulated aerogel space thermal blankets to ensure that these critical blanket assemblies meet ORS mission timeline requirements.  The program tasks are intended to help transition aerogel thermal insulation technology into a refined, integrated capability that can be reliably implemented in a rapid timeframe after mission call up from the field.     Potential Commercial Applications   Potential commercial applications include those requiring thermal insulation in a vacuum where convection and conduction are not important and radiation dominates.  Space applications include NASA, civil and commercial sectors such as missile tracking, surveillance, astronomy, mapping, and weather monitoring. Non-space example applications include superconducting cables, cryogenic gas transportation, storage and transfer; space suits, shipping containers, and home appliances.",

Paradoxically, the attitudes of populations globally are expressed online yet this readily available data has been vastly underutilized.   To address these problems, Aptima proposes MIST (Models of Information and Sentiment Transmission).

In addition, our partners, SentiMetrix, Inc., will provide automated sentiment analysis on the same sources. These entities, sentiment, and concepts will be combined to derive&quot;memes,&quot;or units of cultural information about the attitudes and opinions present in the data. Finally, we will apply epidemiologically-inspired models of information diffusion to these memes to better understand their temporal and spatial change and spread.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Military sensor systems making use of the Common Data Link (CDL) are generating more information, thus taxing the capabilities of available spectrum for the relay of Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) data and information. We will define new sensor-to-link and link-to-ground interface models using behavioral VHDL.  These interface models will provide the capability to perform&quot;what-if&quot;analysis in a graphical environment on parametric models impacting latency and bandwidth. These models will support multiple data rates for Bandwidth Efficient (BE) rates, multiple streaming channels, and segregated control and data channels. We will use state-of-the-art tools for performing modeling, simulation, analysis, and documentation on the developed models.  With the control and data channel models developed, a comprehensive tool set will be created that provides the simulation, analysis, and documentation. The development tool for creating, managing, and executing the test benches will also be developed and refined thus providing the capability to completely simulate the BE-CDL specification. The resulting capabilities will result in more efficient and effective methods for contractors to develop and validate hardware implementations of the BE-CDL specification and allow the Air Force to continue to expand and improve its global sensor network with confidence.  Prior success and new research in our Phase I SBIR has already shown that ECI&quot;s innovative tool suite will be clearly applicable to Air Force systems, technologies, and programs.  BENEFIT:  The need for delivering a comprehensive and accurate simulation model of the data handling and control of the CDL is critical to the success of the Air Force.  Any solutions that can aid in this goal will offer tremendous benefit to the Air Force&quot;s objectives.  Models will enable rapid simulations and analysis of the trade-offs among multiple parameters of CDL component interfaces and different protocol configuration options by providing controllability and observe-ability of the key parameters and status of the interfaces. Using the BOBBIN product, the Air Force can continue to improve their ability to accurately simulate and predict the bandwidth, data rates, and latencies when increasing the complexity and size of their sensor constellations and utilizing different vendor&quot;s hardware. The results of our successful technology transition will also be usable for designers and integrators of CDL assets. The developed models will allow for a greater degree of confidence in specification and design of CDL-based interfaces. By combining an intuitive visual modeling framework with reusable and customizable models, our solution will improve the Air Force&quot;s ability to capture information about its CDL specifications, sensors, and platforms and transform this information into useful knowledge.         The BOBBIN product will be of value wherever there is a need to test and validate BE-CDL hardware, sensors, or other interfacing resources for compliance with the BE-CDL specification. We intend to focus our Phase II commercialization efforts on Air Force ISR applications.  Our first targets after the Air Force will be to introduce the BOBBIN product to the rest of the DoD community, as well as to contractors that manufacture BE-CDL compliant equipment.  BOBBIN will have significant industry applicability in the test, simulation, and validation of BD-CDL compliant hardware and software, and we will pursue licensing opportunities in these markets upon product maturity.",

        "abstract": "?Laser beacons with scalable powers are needed for ground to  deep-space optical communication uplinks. They serve as absolute reference for tracking of spacecraft during the downlink laser communication.  For such space communication link distances the beam spread due to diffraction is significant enough that only few photons are collected by a moderate size optical telescopes on the spacecraft. This necessitates photon-counting detectors suited for the space environment, along with increasing the output power of the laser beacon. Ultra low noise silicon avalanche photo-detector (Si-APD) based position-sensing detectors are used on the spacecraft to detect the laser beacons. Such Si-APDSs are also radiation-hardened and compatible with space-environment operation. It is therefore desirable to operate at shorter wavelengths ~1000nm, where Si-APDs have improved spectral responsivity. This helps to improve the SNR for tracking, and consequently reduce the uplink laser power requirements. Under Phase 2 program Fibertek will design and build a single-channel uplink laser beacon transmitter operating at 1030nm, capable of 500W average output power and 500kHz 16-PPM ary format operation. Inputs from end-user will be solicited for intended use and application, so as to drive the design requirements.

The primary innovation of the current proposal focuses on applying the Innlay surface-embedding technology to embed aircraft transparencies with inherently built-in electrical conductivity, while retaining the transparency&#039;s robustness, providing a superior aircraft transparency material. The material enhancement can be tuned for specific levels of transparency and conductivity to meet various military specifications.

Inexpensive high performance Al/Gr composites have been developed with a quasi-isotropic thermal conductivity (TC) of 600 to 750 W/mK and corresponding thermal expansion (CTE) of 7 to 3 ppm/K.  CTE matching base plates for advanced multi-channel phased array radar systems enable hard (solder) bonded GaN packages for maximum thermal efficiency.  Either liquid cooled or forced air convection cooled base plate can be used for a multi channel array with high thermal dissipation requirements.  FEA thermal modeling will be used to design of the ~8 by 12&quot;baseplate.  The goal is a two to three-fold increase in power density in wide bandgap semiconductors and to manufacture radar arrays with greater than 100 channels on a single ~page sized baseplate.   In a parallel project, baseplates Al/Gr or Cu/Gr composites mounted with high performance single use devices will be cooled by liquid to vapor phase change material at the core of the baseplate.  This combined with direct die attach enabled by CTE matching results in high performance systems for limited duration missions.  Thermal modeling will determine baseplate design and volume of PCM required.",

        "abstract": "Interceptor communication avionics embody number of challenging requirements, including surviving the MDA-STD-001 radiation environment, the necessity for small size, the use of multiple frequency bands and the need to operate in an environment where the link channels may be interrupted or compromised by electromagnetic interference associated with nuclear weapons.  In these environments the MDA links provide communication between the Ballistic Missile Defense System Fire Control (on the ground), interceptors, and satellites. Interceptors may also include Carrier Vehicles (CV) and Kill Vehicles (KV) requiring multiple links in the system. Multiple operating frequency bands are required for these links, including S-, C-, X-, and K-bands. Interceptors are generally physically small, making the size of the communication hardware (e.g. radios or transponders) critical due to limited space.  This SBIR provides innovative solutions to address the unique interceptor communication hardware challenges and provides the opportunity to build a single software-defined radio which addresses all of these issues simultaneously.

Currently, iridium-lined rhenium combustion chambers are the state-of-the-art for in-space engines. NASA's Advanced Materials Bipropellant Rocket (AMBR) engine, a 150-lbf iridium-rhenium chamber produced by Plasma Processes and Aerojet, recently set a hydrazine specific impulse record of 333.5 seconds.  To withstand the high loads during terrestrial launch, rhenium chambers with improved mechanical properties are needed.  Recent EL-FormTM results have shown considerable promise for improving the mechanical properties of rhenium by producing a multi-layered deposit comprised of a tailored microstructure, i.e., Engineered Re. During Phase I, an AMBR size chamber was produced to demonstrate formation of the Engineered Re material in both the throat and barrel regions.  Tensile tests showed the Engineered Re  material had a yield strength greater than 40ksi at room temperature.  In addition, Engineered Re deposits were produced on multiple mandrels at one time, i.e., multi-component process demonstration.  During Phase II, the Engineered Re processing techniques will be optimized. Detailed characterization and mechanical properties test will be performed.  Optimization of the multi-component fabrication technique will result in a 30% or higher reduction in chamber fabrication costs.  The most promising techniques will be selected and used to produce an Engineered Re AMBR size combustion chamber for testing at Aerojet.",

        "abstract": "With retirement of the space shuttle program, microgravity researchers can no longer count on bringing experiment samples back to earth for post-flight analysis. Locker-sized processing facilities, which were typically transported up to and down from the International Space Station during the shuttle era, quite simply consume too much volume, mass, and power to be accommodated as part of both the upmass and downmass on current space transportation vehicles. As a result, more analysis must be accomplished on ISS, which makes on-orbit analytical tools critical to the continued success of microgravity research. The Analytical Cassette transfer Tool (ACT) is a low-cost, disposable device that efficiently transfers experiment samples in a safe and contained manner from unique experiment specific spaceflight hardware to on-orbit analytical tools that enable real-time analysis in microgravity.  ACT interfaces with several flight qualified processing payloads to extract experiment samples via a needle-less septum  and then allows transfer of those samples into a number of different on-orbit analytical devices, including such instrumentation as the Light Microscopy Module, the Microfluidic Flow Cytometer, a Spectrophotometer, and/or a Mass Spectrometer. Applications in life and environmental sciences include sampling liquid cultures/suspensions or sampling spacecraft water for quality evaluation.  ACT functions within or outside of on-orbit gloveboxes to safely transfer any liquid material from one container fitted with the ACT mating receptacle to another container fitted with a receptacle. Its safe, simple, effective, and with its economical advantage, ACT is destined to become the new standard fluid transfer device for the ISS and future space research venues.  For the Phase II project, Techshot will develop a flight version of the ACT and subject it to the major spaceflight integration tests.",

Current activity is focused on extending mission times without increasing the size and weight of the portable life support system (PLSS).  Although CO2 sorbents that can be regenerated during EVA are being studied, these system add \"on back\" hardware, increasing weight and complexity, and reducing reliability.  A simpler approach is to use a membrane system to separate CO2 and H2O from the O2 environment, however separating CO2 from O2 is difficult with standard membranes.  However, developing a low pressure liquid sorbent that reversibly absorbs CO2, could facilitate the needed separation. \n\nIn the Phase I project, Reaction Systems synthesized new CO2 low vapor pressure sorbents that had good reversible CO2 absorption capacity and demonstrated high selectivity for CO2 over O2 in a supported liquid membrane tests. Therefore we demonstrated the feasibility of employing a supported liquid membrane to control CO2 in EVA.  In Phase II we will improve the performance by increasing the sorbent loading, reducing its viscosity, and optimizing the membrane support.

Moreover, we demonstrated how additional features can be developed that provides much-needed, advanced situational awareness for UAV pilots, camera operators and analysts. During Phase II we will:  (1) continue our research and development from Phase II; (2) refine our image registration algorithms and test on a variety of video data sets; (3) optimize our software and port code to graphics processing unit (GPU) hardware to demonstrate real time performance; (4) work with UAV prime contractors, AF personnel, and other UAV stakeholders to refine requirements and identify integration/testing needs; (5) work with potential end users to test the usability of our proposal user interface and overlay techniques; (6) initiate our efforts to commercial and transfer the technology to other programs and domains, and (7) prepare a detailed Phase II demonstration, briefing, and final report.

Using existing aircraft status data, users can maintain situational awareness by visually scanning the actual RAMP situation.  Co-located data and performance statistics aid decision makers working in real-time.  Simulation allows the users to benefit from multiple models being run by ARViSS to explore possibilities.    Two technologies form the basis of the ARViSS visualization and decision aiding system:  Advanced, User-centric Graphical Visualization and Stochastic Simulation.  User-centric graphical depiction of data frees the users of tabular and spreadsheet-based data from having to maintain a complex process model mentally.  The user can engage in active status monitoring, zooming in and out on details while data is represented spatially.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The noise due to jet engine exhausts of current military and commercial aircraft continues to be a major environmental concern since the advent of jet aircraft. The high frequency, intense noise, and associated vibration pose physical and environments hazards to air crews, ground support personnel, and those residing or working in the vicinity of active aviation operations. In order to identify and mitigate the jet noise sources, Spectral Energies, LLC in collaboration with Syracuse University (SU) developed and implemented a high resolution diagnostic method and acquired velocity field simultaneously with near and far-field pressure data. POD and wavelet analyses of this data helped in establishing the cause-effect linkage between the jet turbulent velocity field, the associated unsteady pressure in the jet, and the resulting near field and far field acoustic pressures. Preliminary investigation on flow control was also evaluated during Phase I program.  Based on the progress made during Phase I, the research team proposes the following technical objectives during Phase II: 1) develop and demonstrate the prototype high resolution coupled measurement device and methods from phase I; 2) establish and exhibit a methodology for the analysis of coupled pressure and turbulence data; and 3) develop new concepts for the reduction of jet noise. This research will have significant impact on civilian and military gas turbine engines and land based gas turbine power generation units.  BENEFIT:  The proposed research effort will provide new diagnostic capabilities, computational tools and methodologies for identifying the jet noise sources and methods to control them and also for analyzing pressure and turbulence data.  This research will facilitate the characterization of  noise suppression devices (e.g. plasma actuators, synthetic jet actuators, microjets), associated hardware and software that will enable the government (e.g. Air force, Navy, NASA) and aircraft engine (GE Aviation, Pratt &amp; Whitney) and airframe manufacturers (Boeing Corp. and Lockheed Martin) to address the challenges associated with gas turbine engine and jet noise. These tools are critical for increasing the acceptance rate and long-term health of engines and airframes for the warfighter. The proposed research will help to validate numerical models and to identify and validate control strategies. Such experimental and numerical tools will also lay the foundation for similar tools that would be valuable in the analysis of commercial gas-turbine combustors, internal combustion engines, and stationary power generation systems.",

During this effort we will 1) quantitatively measure spatially resolved 2D temperature in laboratory flames, 2) develop technology for simultaneously measuring concentrations of multiple species (such as OH, CH2O, C2H2, and C6H6) using fiber-based UV-LIF and PLIF, 3) further optimize the sensor components to make the system test-cell ready, and 4) demonstrate the capability of the fiber LIF and PLIF technology by making spatially resolved measurements at a rate 10 kHz or more in real combustors.  Phase-II development will primarily involve integrating the huge knowledge-base acquired during Phase I on optimal UV fibers and laser parameters and also on OH- and NO-PLIF measurements in laboratory flames into a single unit of a sensor system. The ultimate goal of this effort will be to make a transition to the development of a test-cell-ready sensor with quantitative temperature- and concentration-measurement capability.  Finally, we will demonstrate fiber-coupled, high-speed OH-PLIF measurements at 10 kHz in an atmospheric-pressure augmentor test rig and a high-pressure gas-turbine combustor test facility at WPAFB.  BENEFIT:  Phase-II development of a fiber-based high-speed UV LIF/PLIF is expected to result in a commercially viable system that permits LIF diagnostics of multiple species that was never before possible in harsh reacting flow applications.  The whole system would probably limit sales to major combustion and fuels research facilities.  However, the UV laser is the most expensive component, and it is not unusual to find such lasers in combustion research facilities that use LIF diagnostics.  Therefore, a lower-cost option with significantly higher sales potential exists. Specifically, the UV-fiber-based pitch and catch module for high-speed LIF/PLIF, which consists of the delivery, collection, and detection hardware and the software needed for the measurements and analysis.

TRI/Austin will team with the Institute for Advanced Technology at the University of Texas at Austin, with a world class pulsed power facility and gun range for testing the prototype design.  Projectiles up to .45 caliber in electrically conductive and non-conductive materials will be tested at up to C-RAM velocities (1,030 m/s).  Research and development will be conducted to shrink the propellant mechanism down to a one-use cartridge.  This program has the potential to increase soldier safety (removal of propellant) and serve as a template for exploring modification to additional gun systems to achieve variable velocity.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  A sensor concept called Enhanced GEMINI is proposed which exploits a passive visible CMOS imaging array, a new concept in very high sensitivity 3D SWIR Lidar arrays coupled with high pulse rate SWIR fiber lasers, and an extension of state-of-the art in Lamellar Micro-Spectrometers.   These sensing capabilities are used in a single compact, multimode sensor design which a) performs passive visible search out to over 800 km and active 3D search out to 5 km while searching a full hemisphere every 8 seconds, b) high resolution 2D and 3D tracking and imaging of targets entering the proximity of the host vehicle, and c) the capability for analyzing the pulse wavelengths, pulse energies, and pulse rates while in either a search/track mode or a recognition/track mode. Two sensors can provide full spherical coverage around the host vehicle.  Low SWaP enables deployment on a wide variety of hosts with minimized impact.  BENEFIT:  Two new fundamental technologies, the 3D very high sensitivity Lidar receiver and the extended spectral response Lamellar Micro-spectrometer are fundamental advances in the state-of-the-art which will have broad application.  For the Enhanced GEMINI concept these technologies enable an entirely new capability in active 3D large volume search and a capability for detection and analysis of laser illumination of the host vehicle across a very broad spectral region which can be integrated with more tradition passive search/track/identification sensors.  Accomplishing this in a low SWaP sensor installation with minimum impact on the host vehicles will enable a practical, cost effective improvement in the survivability of critical US space assets.  Further, the technologies to be developed during this project will create new opportunities for wide area security surveillance applications, for monitoring chemical contaminations, and for improved 3D Imaging.",

In Phase I OptiGrate demonstrated high quality stretching and compression by CBGs fabricated in photo-thermo-refractive (PTR) glass. Phase II research and development enabled reliable manufacturing of CBGs designed for ultrashort pulse laser systems and extended the stretching time to the unprecedented level of 1 ns while this pulse could be compressed to the level of 200 fs. Record average power of 200 W has been demonstrated. The benefits of usage of such gratings are based on a compact geometry, unprecedented stability to optical radiation, high diffraction efficiency, absence of polarization dependence and durability to environmental conditions. However the most strategic importance of this technology is its scalability to large apertures and thickness which enable scaling to higher power and longer stretching. The specific target set for Phase II.5 of this project is a demonstration of multipass CBGs where 2-ns stretching time which is combined with large aperture up to 1010 mm capable of compressing pulses with energies more than 20 mJ.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The next generation military and commercial space lift systems will utilize reusable, fly-back first stage boosters to reduce cost. These systems must be quickly turned around for subsequent missions. Reliable, nonintrusive, optical measurements to enhance engine health monitoring are desirable to support this need. During Phase-I OKSI successfully demonstrated reliable detection of metallic species on a liquid rocket engine (LRE) using passive emissive spectroscopy. As opposed to active methods (LIBS, LIF, etc.), passive emission spectroscopy is the most attractive concept due to size, weight, and power and cost (SWaP-C) as well as being fundamentally robust.  During Phase-II OKSI will develop a brassboard Optical Sensing System (OSS) which  epresents a flight qualified system (small, light weight, low power, high reliability,  ow cost). Integrated near real-time software will be developed to automatically detected  he presence of metallic species against complex plume background emission signatures  e.g., hydrocarbon molecular emission). The integrated hardware / software system will be demonstrated on controlled lab-scale engine tests where numerous failure modes can be induced. The OSS will also be demonstrated by piggybacking on sub-scale and / or full-scale static engine firings. OKSI will coordinate with organizations specializing in engine health management to establish proper interfaces between the OSS and the engine health management system. At the end of Phase-II, OKSI will be prepared to integrate the OSS with the engine health management system and conduct hardware-in-the-loop testing as well as static engine fire testing.  BENEFIT:  The next generation military and commercial space lift systems will utilize reusable, fly-back first stage boosters to reduce cost. These systems must be quickly turned around for subsequent missions. Reliable, nonintrusive exhaust plume health monitoring is desirable to support this need. The technology developed under this project will enable the detection of metallic species, which is an indication that the engine may need maintenance. As such, the system developed under this program will have direct benefit  to commercial space launch vehicles by improving the safety and reliability of the engines.  The technology also has direct applications to commercial (and military) turbojet aircraft. An enhanced engine health monitoring system technology developed can be used as part of the engine check-out procedure, and once the system proves reliable, it could actually be utilized to reduce the required scheduled maintenance (downtime) for  aircraft. Thus, in addition to increasing safety, an aircraft engine health monitoring system could also reduce operating costs.  These abilities have the potential to prevent catastrophic failures at launch and save hundreds of millions of dollars when expensive payloads are lost. Failures also cripple the US operational ability when unique payloads are lost.",

Current infrared spectrometer technologies, based on diffraction gratings or Fourier transform infrared spectrometers (FTIR), lack portability and are extremely expensive as a result of difficulties in resolving signals in this spectral range. In contrast, the photonic crystal spectrometer uses photonic crystals to manipulate infrared light with high precision, allowing significantly decreased size and cost in a package that has no moving parts, and as a result is highly resistant to environmental effects such as vibration and temperature. The infrared photonic crystal spectrometer is a compact spectral sensing solution suitable for applications where grating spectrometers or FTIR are too bulky or expensive or in extreme environmental conditions . In this project, the infrared photonic crystal technology developed in Phase I will be further developed ultimately resulting in a functional prototype spectral sensing system sensitive between 1 and 14 microns.  BENEFIT:  The anticipated results of this project are customizable IR spectrometer modules suitable for applications in plastics identification and gas monitoring, as well as other applications where a moderate number of infrared spectral signals can be used for identification and monitoring.",

Meeting the booster performance goals with innovative materials technologies is a much lower system level cost approach than by increasing the booster diameter or length.

If a conventional thermal solver is employed on a high-density CFD mesh, the time for a solution becomes prohibitive, and if existing thermal solvers are ported for use on an HPC or GPGPU and then applied to high-density meshes, convergence issues will cause computational times to be excessive. Our objective is to build upon work started in Phase I and modify the thermal solver in MuSES so that solutions on high-density meshes are feasible.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is aimed at developing a handheld system that a cancer surgeon uses to detect and eliminate microscopic residual cancer in the tumor bed after gross resection of the tumor. An integrated laser ablation system instantly removes the cancer cells identified by the imaging system during surgery, eliminating the need for repeat surgery. Effective resection of cancer is often difficult because of the need to spare essential tissue (blood vessels, nerves, brain) adjacent to the tumor and the lack of visual resolution of the tumor bed during manual resection. The integrated laser ablation system developed in Phase II will enhance the surgical technique by quickly and precisely eliminating residual cancer cells in the tumor bed. The objective of Phase II is to deliver a system ready for clinical trials, which includes: increasing the ablation speed, developing a larger field of view, and demonstrating efficacy in animal studies. After completion of this program, Lumicell will validate the performance of the novel system in human clinical trials. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project stems from improvements in patient care and reduction of healthcare costs. Currently, around 50% of breast cancer patients and 35% of sarcoma patients require second tumor de-bulking surgeries because a final pathology report returns days after the initial surgery indicating that residual cancerous cells have been left within the patient. Furthermore, 25% of the final pathology reports do not detect residual cancer cells due to sampling errors fundamentally inherent in the process. Thus, most patients require subsequent medical therapy including additional radiation or chemotherapy treatment to prevent cancer recurrence and metastasis stemming from residual cancer cells. The system is designed to find and destroy residual cancer cells in real-time at a single cell level. Tumors adjacent to critical nerve or brain tissue are particularly difficult and a laser therapy guided by the proposed imaging system would allow the surgeon to thoroughly eradicate cancer cells with minimal added work and no adverse effect on surrounding tissue. Lumicell&#039;s novel single cell imaging device combined with focused laser ablative therapy will have a significant impact on preventing second surgeries and subsequent medical therapy resulting in significant healthcare cost savings and improved patient care.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project develops novel technologies for separation and concentration of intrinsically magnetically susceptible algae for production of biofuels and biochemicals. Phase II builds on the feasibility demonstrated in Phase I using a model alga. During Phase II, an algal strain used for production of renewable biofuel feedstock will be utilized. Novel transformation vectors and tools developed for a production strain, Auxenochlorella protothecoides, will be used to make the algae magnetically susceptible. These traits provided an advantage vs. wild-type strains in growth in low iron medium for the model alga. Phase II will test modified algal strains at lab- and subpilot-scale to determine their performance in growth, and competition with wild-type and weedy algal strains. Additionally, strains will be tested for their ability to be separated or harvested magnetically. This separation will be modeled to determine cost efficacy for primary or secondary dewatering. The specificity of this separation will also be evaluated in relation to downstream use in a heterotrophic bioreactor. The OSU collaboration allows use of these strains in novel rare earth magnetic separators. The endpoint will be novel technologies to improve the overall cost structure for the production of algae-derived biofuels and biochemicals. The broader impact/commercial potential of this Phase 2 research project will be to provide improvements in the economics of producing renewable biofuels using algae as the production system. It directly addresses one of the major issues with algal biofuels, cost effective dewatering. It also provides a potential selective advantage of the modified strains by improving its ability to compete for iron in an open environment (such as open raceways or photobioreactors). The nation has a critical need to improve its energy security and reduce its dependence on fossil fuels. This research will help address both of these needs. The overall purpose of this research project is business related and focused on commercialization of this technology through integration in a biofuel production process. This research project focuses on a high cost portion of the production process, dewatering, as well as a critical unit process, the heterotrophic bioreactor. The collaboration with OSU and the Cleveland Clinic will result in training of students in this area. The company plans to publish the results of this project once proper control of the intellectual property generated is accomplished.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop a pilot-scale production system and process to enable the large-scale fabrication of continuous arrays of elastomeric micro/nano-scale fibers with complex geometry. Inspired by hairs that occur naturally on gecko feet, these micro/nano-scale elastomeric fibers demonstrate strong adhesive, shear, and peel strengths over a wide range of test substrates. Unlike other classes of adhesives such as pressure-sensitive tapes, these biologically-inspired adhesives can be repeatedly used over thousands of test cycles with very little contamination and performance degradation over the material lifespan. However, this class of material has only been able to be fabricated through expensive micro/nano fabrication processes including photolithography, chemical etching, or time-consuming batch micro/nano molding processes. In this project, a pilot-scale manufacturing system will be constructed, optimized and evaluated. A roller-based molding and peeling process for high-speed, continuous, and large-area manufacturing of high aspect-ratio and three-dimensional micro/nano-scale fibers with a compliant backing layer will be developed using elastomer materials. The broader/commercial impacts of this project will be the potential to provide a low-cost, high-volume process to mass produce continuous arrays of elastomeric micro/nano-scale fibers with complex geometry for applications in apparel, sporting equipment, healthcare, defense, industrial clamping, and consumer goods. These fibers will provide strong reversible adhesive or enhanced shear interfaces that are resistant to contamination and maintain their adhesive ability over the product lifespan.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will result in a bandage that accelerates wound healing to the surface of the eye. Eye wounds are extremely painful, can cause vision loss, and may fail to heal on their own. Trauma may occur due to household cleaning agents, traumatic impact from a falling object, or removal of a contact lens. Ocular surgeries, such as cataract and refractive surgeries, are also sources for corneal injury. Delays in healing may lead to scarring and permanent visual loss. This project will lead to the first biodegradable &quot;green&quot; corneal bandage that accelerates corneal healing. The bandage resembles a contact lens. When this bandage is placed on a wounded eye it reduces inflammation and stimulates the healing process. It is made of a novel biomaterial, which can be programmed to &quot;dissolve&quot; within hours to days providing patients with a tailored product. Completed work from Phase I demonstrated the corneal bandage significantly accelerated corneal healing rate. During Phase II further development will ready the product for human clinical trials. Results from Phase II will produce the final product design, quality system implementation, and initial development of a GMP manufacturing process. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will help the 2 million Americans that sustain traumatic injuries to the cornea each year, and the 4 million Americans that undergo surgery annually leaving the cornea wounded. Such corneal wounds cause intense pain and may lead to blindness depending on the severity. This new eye bandage accelerates corneal healing and adheres to the surface of the eye to aid in alleviating pain. The bandage is inexpensive and will result in a less expensive procedure for treating cornea trauma resulting in millions in savings to the American health care system, while allowing for the expansion of the point of care environments (i.e. clinic, home use, hostile environments). Production is fully scalable to large quantities, and can be easily packaged and distributed in a similar fashion as a contact lens. Furthermore, the eye bandage is an innovative technology, patented, and new to the medical device industry.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will expand on the successful work from Phase I project on synthesis and characterization of metal oxide nanocomposite materials that can capture HBr and be regenerated to produce bromine. The capture and regeneration capabilities of these materials are integral to the economic viability of the GRT Gas-to-Fuels/Chemicals rocess and the GRT Propane-to-Propylene Process. In the GRT Processes, natural gas alkanes are (1) reacted with bromine to form reactive lkyl bromides that are (2) reacted over catalysts to produce alkanes, aromatic compounds and olefins. The metal oxide nanocomposite was ound very efficient at sequestering HBr produced in the process as a metal bromide. The use of metal oxides allows for a very inexpensive eparation of HBr from the hydrocarbon products. Subsequent oxidation of the metal bromide produces bromine. Thus the bromine needed in 1) is generated in situ as necessary and is fully contained within the process. During Phase I, we identified metal oxide nanocomposite materials with favorable capacity and capture-regeneration cycle stability that makes industrial use economic. The proposed work is targeted at conducting further testing of these composite nanomaterials on a larger scale and in combination with other Process steps. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is that it can contribute to the urgent need for methods to economically produce renewable hydrocarbon fuels and high value chemicals that are more efficient than existing technologies. GRT is developing novel processes for the conversion of methane, ethane and propane into higher value hydrocarbons suitable for gasoline and jet fuel blend stocks, aromatic compounds or high value chemicals which can cost-effectively utilize stranded and/or small reserves of natural gas and shale gas. This upgrade of inexpensive natural gas to high value transportation fuels and chemicals at the source is very valuable because it eliminates the need for gas processing and pipeline transportation. The commercial viability of these technologies depends on energy efficiency and the capital cost of plant equipment. Improvement in the performance and stability of solid reactant/metal oxide nanocomposite materials will make substantial improvements in both of these metrics and hence in the commercial viability of the GRT Processes.",

A fundamental limitation in these systems has been the size of the optics in relation to the size of the imaging sensor. Mirror diameters in the range of 10 times the size of the sensor have been achieved. The objective of this research is to overcome the above limitation and achieve mirror diameters at the level of 3-5 times the size of the sensor, keeping ultra high resolution across the entire field of view.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on the further development of an advanced, mobile, easy-to-use, patient-oriented, advanced Home Hemodialysis (HHD) system that minimizes the use of water (less than 6 liters) and medical waste, and importantly, minimizes nutrient loss. End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a devastating, disabling disease. Many ESRD patients and their family members are severely limited in the mobility and freedom due to the time and effort of having hemodialysis (HD) treatments at hospitals and dialysis centers. Our ultimate goal is to develop a next generation lightweight HD machine (~22 kg) equipped with high precision components and an innovative dialysate regeneration cartridge (DRC). This Phase II program focuses on the construction of a prototype HHD machine that is fully equipped with necessary functions and safety devices. The intellectual merits are based on both the highly efficient and selective DRC composed of a specifically functionalized sorbent, and the compact and highly efficient HD machine that allows for a well-configured and accurately controlled dialysis treatment. This development would greatly improve quality of life for ESRD patients and their families by allowing for effective and comfortable treatment at home, or even at work or school. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project, if successful, is to reduce the economic burden of ESRD on both patients and Federal healthcare programs. As the number of HD patients approaches 3 million globally, it is becoming critical to decrease the cost and resource burden of treating these patients by drastically decreasing facility costs, use of water and energy in treatment. The second impact is to increase patients&#039; quality of life by facilitating greater flexibility in the length and place of treatment (home, school, work). This system also allows for the personalized dialysis treatment of patients through selective adsorption of toxins. The proposed mobile, semi-portable HD machine offers many advantages over currently available dialysis systems, resulting in high commercial potential. The system will enhance the scientific and technical knowledge in the fields of bioengineering of dialysis and chemistry of sorbent technologies. Given the flexibility in dialysis treatment, the quality of life of dialysis patients will be greatly enhanced. Since this product achieves two goals simultaneously, namely improved treatment and reduced cost, it has a significant advantage over many of the competitive products available today.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to develop a stretchy, disposable, textile glove intended to prevent cross-contamination with 3-log reduction against bio-pathogens in under 90 seconds. Its chlorine coating lasts for three days and unlike nitrile, latex, and vinyl gloves, is breathable, reducing dermatitis associated with continual barrier glove use. Currently antiseptic test standards for textiles, hand wash and hand rubs, AATCC TM-100, BS EN 1499 and EN 1500 are inadequate to accurately evaluate project&#039;s goal of 3-log reduction in 30-90 seconds. We developed a new protocol appropriate to these faster times and that specifically measures contact transfer - the Contact Transfer Test Protocol - that measures cross-contaminating efficacy in seconds. This new protocol can be used in the evaluation of other biocidal systems aiming for short pathogen kill speeds. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project, if successful, is an innovation in the field of cross-contamination control. While other attempts to make a self-decontaminating fabric have been made, their 3-log kill times are much longer than the 30-90 second goal of the BioTecT Glove. The new BioTecT Glove represents a significant contribution to the field of pathogen control, such as Vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (VRSA) and Methicillin-resistant staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) that persist even where strong hand antiseptic and barrier glove programs are in place. While the largest demand for the introduction of an innovative solution intended to decrease the number of facility acquired infections (FAIs) may be in the healthcare field, many other markets such as hospitality facilities, the janitorial field, and correctional institutions can also benefit greatly from this technology. From a financial perspective, the cost of an infectious outbreak to a healthcare facility can be catastrophic. Moreover, the socio-political consequences and the impact on a facility&#039;s reputation can create long-term negative impressions that may remain in the public&#039;s conscience for extended periods of time.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to develop a real-time ultrasound system for evaluating musculoskeletal soft tissue conditions by implementing the novel ultrasound post-processing software developed in Phase I into a programmable platform ultrasound system. Today, radiologists diagnose most musculoskeletal diseases by observing static MRI or conventional ultrasound images and considering key factors that support only qualitative, subjective assessments. Developing an efficient, real-time, quantitative method for diagnosing soft tissue (e.g., tendons and ligaments) injuries and monitoring healing can lead to more accurate diagnoses and reduce re-injury of incompletely healed tissues. The project will enhance the novel software technology&#039;s clinical utility and workflow efficiency. The original software will be enhanced by improving the software to automatically detect a region of interest with the ultrasound image. The registered regions of interest can be matched precisely from one patient visit to the next. Developing data mining software will further increase efficiency and accuracy by leveraging machine learning to assist with diagnostic decisions. These software improvements will be integrated with the platform ultrasound system to improve clinical workflow. The integrated product will both match the work flow efficiency of standard ultrasound and dramatically advance the utility of ultrasound within the musculoskeletal arena. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project, if successful, will dramatically improve clinicians&#039; ability to care for soft tissue injuries and will position the company to capitalize on (1) pressure to reduce medical imaging costs, (2) musculoskeletal specialists&#039; growing interest in ultrasound, especially portable instruments, (3) a major ultrasound manufacturer&#039;s focus on the large and relatively untapped musculoskeletal ultrasound market, and (4) the recent emergence of quantitative ultrasound for non-musculoskeletal applications. This Phase II project will produce an efficient, real-time, quantitative method for diagnosing soft tissue injuries and monitoring healing. In the US alone, overuse injuries (strains, sprains) are the most frequently reported musculoskeletal injuries. Annually, 18.4 million such injuries cost approximately $92 B. Patients suffering from musculoskeletal injuries currently face three challenges at diagnosis, care, and outcome. First, current diagnostic methods, including MRI, ultrasound, or physical manipulation, rely on highly subjective and observer-dependent interpretation, so accuracy varies. Second, MRI is still the standard of care, but is far more costly than ultrasound. Substituting ultrasound for MRI, where appropriate for initially diagnosing musculoskeletal conditions, could save Medicare $736 M/year. Third, the lack of an objective monitoring method to determine when a patient can safely return to activity means patients risk missing unnecessary work time or re-injury.",

        "abstract": "Tactical counter-concealment aerial sensors that are currently being developed by the U.S. Army operate at VHF, UHF and/or L-band frequencies. These radars must operate in environments in which there can be a significant amount of unintentional radio frequency interference (RFI) (i.e. communications, terrestrial broadcast, etc.), operating in close proximity to systems operating in similar radar bands and/or possibly hostile electronic attack (EA). The RFI and/or EA, which are received through an antenna&quot;s mainlobe, sidelobes, and/or backlobes, can significantly degrade the image quality and adversely affect system capability.     The primary objective of this Phase II SBIR is to develop a prototype consisting of detailed software simulation to demonstrate how well the proposed TC-CAS EP techniques would perform in complex EA and RFI environments.   The techniques deemed feasible under the Phase I program will be refined and applied to available radar test data as provided by the U.S. Army or interested prime contractors to reduce future implementation risk as TSC works toward commercialization of the most promising EP techniques for current or future low frequency Army SAR/GMTI radars.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Combustion stability is critical to the performance of augmented military jet engines.  Instabilities such as screech can result in reduced augmentor performance, blowout, or even catastrophic failure.  Screech remains a difficult problem to predict and mitigate, and its occurrence can limit the operational flight envelope of military systems.  Many of the passive techniques used to suppress combustion instabilities in stationary gas turbines are unsuitable for military propulsion systems.  Advanced active control techniques involving high-bandwidth active cancellation of instabilities have not been applied to real systems due to their inherent complexity.  In this research program, Creare and Georgia Institute of Technology propose to further develop an advanced fueling system for low-bandwidth active screech suppression.  The fueling system provides control of the spatial distribution of heat release, allowing for manipulation of symmetry and convective time delays in the augmentor without structural modifications.  In Phase I, we demonstrated the feasibility of this approach for transverse instability suppression in a single flame holder augmentor rig.  In Phase II, we will design, fabricate, and demonstrate our approach with more realistic geometry and operating conditions.  Design activity will be supported by an existing computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tool for predicting fuel distribution in augmentors.  BENEFIT:  Technology derived from this project will be in two forms.  First, we will develop a novel fueling system for low-bandwidth active control of augmentor screech.  The system will be suitable for retrofit into modern military systems such as the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter.  In addition, this research program is expected to improve the overall understanding of the mechanism(s) that couple heat release and acoustics in augmentor systems.  This new insight will help expand the flight envelope for augmented military jet engines, increase the robustness of augmentor systems, and lead to more capable, cost-effective aircraft.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Optical Physics Company (OPC) is proposing to design and build a flight ready miniature interferometric star tracker unit for cubesats (C-MiST).   C-MiST will be a stand-alone device with its own processor, built in software and a space plug-and-play architecture (SPA) compliant interface.    OPC has been developing the interferometric star tracker concept under SBIR contracts funded by both the Air Force and MDA. The Navy has also funded two different applications of this tracker technology.  Current interferometric star tracker technology maturity is TRL 4.  During the first phase of this project, OPC proved the feasibility of the specific C-MiST design by analysis and simulation.       During the Phase II project, the C-MiST design will be finalized with all components specified so they can be procured or built cost-effectively using available tools.  C-MiST hardware includes the optics, the read-out and processor electronics, and the mechanical enclosure including sunshade.  These parts will be assembled into a complete C-MiST unit and subjected to both laboratory and field tests to verify flight readiness.  Starfield image processing modules embedded in flight software and a SPA-compliant cubesat interface will be coded and tested. At the end of the Phase II project, C-MiST will be delivered to AFRL.      BENEFIT:  OPC is building three product lines around its interferometric star tracker technology.   These product lines are star trackers for spacecraft guidance, navigation and control, sensors for ISR missions for tracking dim objects of interest, and GPS independent navigation and guidance on airborne platforms.  The hardware and software developed for the self contained C-MiST package will benefit all three product lines.      At the national level, any star tracker development project should be aimed at reviving the domestic manufacturing base for this device which has been waning in the United States.  OPC has been investing in star tracker technology development with the goal of becoming a star tracker device manufacturer.  OPC is already working on realizing this vision and has formulated a funding scenario to reach this goal.",

This proposal describes a flight-capable blade health monitoring system that uses a compact and robust approach to on-wing turbine engine measurements. MSI&quot;s two-sensor approach is unique to the proposer, and provides the means to dramatically reduce the sensor count compared to other NSMS systems.  The work in this project will be planned, performed, and reviewed in close cooperation with the Propulsion Instrumentation Working Group (PIWG) and its member companies. This lays the groundwork for a transition path for this technology. The proposed technology development and validation program will bring this system to technology readiness level 7 by the conclusion of Phase II.  BENEFIT:  Improvements in on-wing blade health monitoring capability will significantly reduce the cost and risk of development and operation of military and commercial gas turbine engines, industrial gas turbines used for power generation, as well as many types of industrial steam turbines, compressors and expanders. The costs associated with maintenance, downtime, and readiness are already well established and understood by both military and industrial users. By designing the system to meet the flight system requirements of the PIWG community and validating the system with laboratory and engine tests, Mechanical Solutions is confident that a successful technology transition will occur.",

Such behavior can often be used to compromise the security of a computer system, leaving the system vulnerable to attacks that may disrupt the system&quot;s behavior or exfiltrate sensitive information.  Autonomy-oriented computation offers the potential to allow complex computer systems to police themselves, detecting intrusion, performing self-healing, and directly countering cyber threats. An autonomic computing system tracks its own state to reason about properties such as system security and integrity. When anomalies are detected, the system can react to restore itself to its intended operation.   A key first step in creating autonomic computing systems is developing self-monitoring technology.

AELEIS features an agent-based approach to autonomously mine data from multiple sources and combine the information into actionable knowledge. AELEIS processes data in many forms (e.g., reports, data logs, database entries, etc.), including textual data. The processing occurs in the background so information is available at a moments notice when the operator needs it. AELEIS uses advanced technologies, such as Adaptive Resonance Theory, Evidential Data Reasoning, and Mahalanobis-Taguchi System, for diagnostics and prognostics.

We propose to create such an Advanced Prototyping Environment (APE) based on open source components that, given a specification of required items, dynamically instantiates virtual machines to provide just the services and components needed to develop and test mission critical services, components, and complete environments (SCEs). Access is controlled via digitally-signed certificates, which determine users&quot;access to resources and SCE trust-level. Developers of new SCEs can use APE to instantiate a stand-alone sandbox on their own hardware, which provides mocked up data behind real service interfaces, providing confidence that code developed will port directly to real services. Owners of finished SCEs can use the bundled APE software/hardware to perform tests with real service interfaces. APE supports multiple groups that are testing different SCEs on its blade servers through hardware virtualization, which is a prelude to deploying SCEs to the Fleet. APE can run in a lab or even be carried onto ships for testing at sea.",

SHARP produced schedules are constantly improved by genetic algorithms which are informed by existing scheduling systems, and other automated administrative systems. Disruptions to an optimal schedule such as discovery of a needed repair after inspection are accounted for, and incorporated into the plan, resulting in a new optimized schedule. This optimization process continuously monitors all data streams, finding efficiencies in the defined business process.

Mechanics and facility managers can access schedules from a web page. A dispatcher through a web page approves repair procedures, and can also modify priority of schedules to reflect current situational needs.  BENEFIT:  The ten year induction schedule assists WR/ALC and its customers with the management of aircraft, and budgeting needs.

Diagnostics that elucidate the mechanism(s) of combustion instability are needed to increase the robustness of current engines and to develop improved design rules for future systems.  Diagnostic measurements in augmentors are challenging due to the hostile environment and limited optical access.  In this program, we are developing fiber-optically coupled, passive optical sensors for measuring heat release and fuel distribution in real engines.  The measurement is based on passive optical spectroscopy of flame emissions.  Two sensor embodiments are being developed: an imaging sensor, and a line-of-sight (LOS) probe with increased sensitivity and time response.  The sensors are intended to be flush-mounted on the internal surfaces of an engine for ground-based research.  In Phase I, we developed and demonstrated proof-of-concept prototypes for both sensor embodiments.  Sensor performance was demonstrated using a single flameholder augmentor rig with good optical access.  In Phase II, we will extend the TRL of both sensor embodiments.  We will develop an imaging sensor capable of capturing four images of different spectral bands on a single camera, and we will also investigate a high-speed imaging embodiment.  Phase II will conclude with a J-85 engine test.  BENEFIT:  The outcome of this project will be a new TRL 6 diagnostic for measuring heat release and fuel distribution in augmentors and other combustors.  This technology could potentially provide novel insight into augmentor combustion processes such as augmentor screech, ignition, propagation, and lean blowout.  Beyond Phase II, the technology could be extended into a flight sensor for active combustion control in augmentors and other combustors.  We expect to commercialize the sensor via licensing to an existing supplier of combustion diagnostic tools.  The sensor will then be available for use in a wide range of military and commercial combustion systems.",

        "abstract": "The AutoTIVA system, to be developed under this program, comes as an answer to the Army requirement for a \"deployable automated analgesia and anesthesia system\".     The AutoTIVA device concept is akin to that of an autopilot for anesthesia and sedation, where the administration of both intravenous analgesics and hypnotics are adjusted continuously in real-time, to drive and maintain patients in a pre-defined cortical activity level.     This system integrates a clinical-grade 2-channel electroencephalographic device to acquire the patient brainwaves, and our proprietary WAVcns analysis to calculate the level of cortical activity from the acquired signals. The proprietary WAVcns index is used as a feedback quantity to regulate the infusion rates of both analgesics and hypnotics. Drug delivery is ensured via two off-the-shelf syringe infusion pumps directly connected to the AutoTIVA platform.     The proposed Phase II program builds on our Phase I results, transitioning from a prototype-level system to a first commercial device deployable at the outset of the program. In addition, further enhancements of the system user interface and control mechanism will be made to address some of the limitations identified in the Phase I, and based on the feedback from our Clinical Advisory Board.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Shelters can be considered as the logistical backbone of military operations. Therefore the 500 CBSS / GBLE - AF Tactical Shelters/Radomes/Towers Program Office has determined a need to research the potential and feasibility of developing an improved shelter design that meets the needs of systems and users across the DoD. Every branch of the armed services has countless millions worth of such mission critical shelter equipment in various configurations.    To meet this need, CSSI is maturing a composite shelter design with modular panels which can be quickly swapped to accommodate configuration, mission, and/or system changes. Custom panels, developed to meet Force Protection needs such as ballistics and extreme thermal environments, can be inserted in the snap-together composite frame. This&quot;Rapid Assembly&quot;design will reduce the time required during base construction.  CSSI has developed a sound and innovative approach to manufacture and build a prototype for a baseline non-expandable 20 foot ISO shelter. Special emphasis is on achieving and ISO-stacking qualification test as well as superior energy efficiency in harsh global climates. The benefits of this new shelter asset would ripple through the entire inventory of DoD assets.    BENEFIT:  The government sector has a need for the shelter asset and once it is fully developed and certified it could be stock-listed. Given the lower price than the current aluminum container at less than half the weight, there would be an incentive for the government buyer to select this asset. Its flexibility and ruggedness would ripple through the DoD inventory. Since the shelter is virtually maintenance-free important life-cycle savings will result because of greatly reduced maintenance costs, and eco-advantages such no as need to paint, no need for paint strippers, or to fight corrosion. DoD would also benefit from reduce energy costs since the all composite shelters would exceed energy/thermal efficiency.    The transportation industry has an immediate need for shelters/ ISO containers which are lightweight and fit the logistics requirements. The benefits which could accrue are estimated in the $70M/ year range. Longer term benefits would accrue from the maritime ISO-container sales.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Infrared cameras for thermal imaging applications can operate between 2-14 microns.  These cameras produce a thermal image using two-dimensional arrays of infrared detectors (such as ferroelectric detectors or microbolometers).  Some critical military applications (such as spatial analysis of combustion processes in turbines combustors and afterburners) require the use of high spatial resolution infrared fiber bundle imagers (FBIs) due to the area of study being inaccessible to infrared cameras because of limited size and/or extreme environment.  Coherent FBIs are commonly used in the visible and near infrared (0.4 to 1 microns) to remotely transfer images to cameras.  Unfortunately, coherent FBIs for infrared imaging in the range of 1-12 microns are not commercially available.  The work conducted during the SBIR Phase I demonstrated the feasibility of developing innovative FBIs that are inexpensive, flexible, rugged, high fiber-count bundles for use in the 1-12 microns.  The FBI fabrication process will be perfected during Phase II effort to produce low-cost coherent infrared imaging fiber bundles that are 2-4 m in length, 1000-10,000 fibers in a 10 mm diameter bundle, minimum bend radius of 8 cm and attenuation less than 1 dB/m over the spectral range of 1 to 12 microns.    BENEFIT:  Fiber bundle imagers (FBIs) in the spectral range of 1-12 microns have many potential applications.  The proposed FBI is targeted primarily at military applications for infrared viewing of harsh environment and/or in tight space where infrared camera cannot be used.  The Air Force has a specific requirement for infrared viewing at turbine combustors and afterburners.  The infrared FBI has other potential uses in military aircraft for surveillance, reconnaissance, and threat warning systems.  Security Agencies (Federal Bureau of Investigation, Department of Homeland Security) and law enforcement officials could use the infrared FBI as a thermal fiber endoscope for covert surveillance from a safe distance to support hostage rescue, building surveillance, clearance, and search operations.  Also the FBI can be made small enough to apply infrared spectroscopy to the study of human and other tissues.  In-vivo biomedical imaging could differentiate spectra of cancerous tissues from those of corresponding non-cancerous tissues.",

        "abstract": "Supersonic air vehicles require nose radomes that can withstand high temperatures as well as have high RF transmission over wider radio frequency bandwidths. Typically nose radomes are built from solid laminate or monolithic ceramic materials which inherently have a very narrow frequency band over which they are RF transparent. The proposed concept leverages a qualified ceramic matrix composite (CMC) AS-N312 as the outer shell that will withstand the forces and environments. To achieve wider bandwidths, lower dielectric ceramic foam materials are added to the inner surface enabling transmission of a broader range of wavelengths. The proposed designs avoid inclusion of an inner skin that would form a more traditional sandwich structure to prevent significant shear stresses from occurring in the ceramic foams. The program will develop candidate foams, build a prototype radome using all materials consistent with high speed flight profiles, and provide test data on the RF transmission characteristics of candidate layered designs. Affordability is improved because AS-N312 is the lowest cost, qualified structural ceramic material available today, and the processes to achieve other attributes such as erosion protection and EMI filters are also fully developed and cost effective.",

Princeton Optronics has developed high power VCSEL arrays delivering hundreds of watts of power from small arrays and has developed moderate power high brightness arrays for fiber laser pumping. The technology, after the developments of phase I, is in a position so that in this SBIR it can be developed as the technology of choice for high power fiber laser pumping because of its potential very high brightness, lower cost, higher reliability and higher temperature of operation without chillers.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) II project outlines in vivo testing of semi-synthetic therapeutic protein conjugates. Low molecular weight peptide drugs have had limited therapeutic utility due to rapid clearance and, consequently must be injected very frequently. These drugs could be conjugated to a carrier protein. Attachment to large biomolecules, such as carrier proteins, improves the half-life profile of these peptides. Historically, many of these carrier proteins are recombinant genetic fusions with the peptide of interest. With fusion, the carrier?s attachment to the peptide is limited to one site, the end terminus, and that limited placement can impact drug function and thus potency. As an alternative, chemical modification to carrier proteins with small molecule drugs can also render the drug more potent and longer lasting. The scientists at Redwood Bioscience have developed a technology platform that can universally modify proteins in a controlled, site-specific manner. They have generated carrier protein scaffolds, modified recombinant Fc domains that are homogeneous and easy to chemically elaborate with therapeutic peptides. Furthermore, optimized peptide conjugation to the Fc proteins improves conjugate activity in vitro. This technology is to be further validated through an initial in vivo analysis. The broader impacts of this research are the development of best in class therapeutics and the generation of a robust protein modification platform. This work will change the utility of protein therapeutics by enabling optimization of therapeutic peptides that otherwise would not be useful as treatment for disease.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will stimulate the acceptance of carbon capture by companies that own and operate coal-fired plants. The Department of Energy considers the amine absorption of carbon dioxide (CO2) from flue gas of coal-fired power plants as the most advanced, most well understood, and most successful method for carbon capture. In this process, monoethanolamine (MEA) solvent is used in a thermal process for desorption and carbon capture. Unfortunately, the thermal process is very inefficient, requiring a 30% increase in coal usage for to capture the CO2. The Phase I research proved the feasibility of replacing the inefficient thermal process with a new, innovative photolytic process that has the potential to dramatically cut the 30% increase in coal usage by more than half. The first part of the Phase II project will focus on developing an efficient photolytic prototype reactor that will dramatically reduce the costs of capturing CO2 as preparation for field tested at a power plant. The Phase II objectives will focus first on optimizing the reactor processes that affect desorption and capture. Then, using the resulting data, the team will design and build the prototype reactor. The broader impacts of this research are that it has the potential to make carbon capture at coal fired power plants significantly more cost effective for the power producer. For example, by retrofitting the photolytic technology, a 100-500 MWe power plant could save as much as $17 MM annually. With this type of saving, an investment by a power plant in the photolytic technology is likely to produce a very high rate of return, whereby the cost of adding the photolytic reactor process could be recouped in approximately three years. The World Coal Institute reports that coal &amp; #8223;s share of global electricity generation is set to increase from 41% to 44% by 2030. In the United States, electricity generation accounts for approximately 40% of total CO2 emissions and more than 80% of these emissions come from coal fired power plants. Near-term CO2 capture technologies raise the cost of electricity (COE) produced at these plants by 60-90%, and impose a 25-35% parasitic coal-burning load. As the U.S. searches for ways to reduce CO2 emissions, maintaining coal as a viable source of low-cost electric power critically depends on finding more cost effective ways to capture the CO2 produced. The energy efficient photolytic process developed in this project has the potential of reducing the increase in the COE for carbon capture from the current 60-90% for the thermal process to less than 35%.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is targeted at the development of a novel, low-cost continuous method for the production of ionic liquids. Ionic liquids are a class of industrial chemicals with broad applications in energy, pharmaceutical, biomass and solar fields. Ionic liquids are leading candidates for electrolytes in advanced batteries and capacitors where they enable non-flammable, longer-lived batteries that store more energy than current models. While the potential of ionic liquids is significant, the current cost is prohibitive. Boulder Ionics Corporation proposes to develop a novel, cost-effective method for producing ionic liquids in industrial volumes. The highly flexible technique enables continuous production of ionic liquids with low capital cost. It eliminates the use of solvents in the synthesis process, and produces a very high purity product. In Phase II the company will develop the novel synthesis process, demonstrate low-cost ways of making key precursors, and develop techniques for purifying and measuring the purity of the products. Successful completion of the program will result in low-cost, high-performance electrolytes for advanced energy storage. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to make ionic liquids cost-effective in a wide range of industries. Ionic liquids can replace volatile organic solvents in a vast range of industrial processes, are leading candidates for biomass processing, and have broad applications in electrochemistry, advanced batteries, supercapacitors/ultracapacitors and as heat transfer fluids in advanced concentrating solar plants. In addition, our innovative synthesis technique has broad application across the chemical industry. Cost-effective ionic liquids are critical elements of the new energy economy, with applications in biomass, solar power, and grid-scale energy storage. Techniques developed in this research will enhance scientific understanding of novel chemical reactors, leading to a new generation of more efficient and less-polluting chemical plants.

The results of the Phase I study confirmed the biomechanical approach was effective in reducing PAHs at rates exceeding 99%.

The research objectives of this project are to design and develop a 2D IR spectrometer, including an efficient mid-infrared laser source, which requires no technical skills to operate. It will utilize mid-infrared pulse shaping, a newly designed optical parametric amplifier, and a mid-IR pump laser. The system will be mechanically robust and computer automated so that it will be used by 2D IR experts and non-experts alike. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the development of a commercial 2D IR spectrometer that will be used in academic, government, and industrial research laboratories worldwide with applications spanning the biological, chemical and physical sciences. 2D IR spectroscopy provides structural and dynamical information that is difficult to obtain with other techniques, such as at inorganic/organic interfaces that are important in solar cell research or membrane proteins associated with pharmaceutical targets. There are more than 15,000 research laboratories worldwide that utilize infrared spectroscopy of some type, and 2000 labs that utilize ultrafast spectroscopy. Thus, the commercial potential is substantial. The development of this laser technology has important societal implications due to the wide range of scientific and industrial topics that this technology can be applied.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop spin-coatable liquid precursors for extremely high etch resistance pattern transfer layers (hardmasks) to enable novel devices in advanced integrated circuit manufacturing. The approach is to employ the fully inorganic metal oxide dielectric precursors demonstrated during the Phase I project to provide unparalleled etch selectivity for lithography spin-on hardmask layers. Such materials enable new architectures and deep etches required for future device generations which demand increasingly complex integration of materials to compensate for the limited etch selectivity of conventional organic patterning materials. The expected outcome is one or more inorganic spin-on hardmask materials ready for scale up to manufacturing. The broader/commercial impact of this project will be the potential to provide materials to improve performance of integrated circuit devices manufactured at dimensions below 22 nm. This project addresses key challenges in the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors related to patterning requirements for future high performance electronic devices. The aqueous precursors are synthesized from environmentally benign raw materials, thereby reducing the environmental impact relative to conventional organic materials. The materials and low temperature processes developed in this project will also lay the foundation for broader applications in electronics, energy, and optical coatings.",

QM Power, in conjunction with development partner Dell Engineering Services, will complete the design, analysis, prototyping and system integration of its generator technology into the PoD and will evaluate various accessories which allow the user to input mechanical energy via a crank, gravity assist mechanism or other methods. Research results from the Phase I effort indicate that utilizing QM Power generator technology in an auxiliary power/recharging system has the potential to reduce human input requirements by over 30% compared to state-of-the-art product offering now available. The broader impacts of this research are that the PoD will enable users to obtain critical power on demand and provide substantial environmental and public benefits (reducing grid dependence, disposable battery issues and providing power to emerging markets that lack access). Mobile devices have become increasingly power hungry while advances in battery energy density have not kept pace. As a result, the length of use, mobility, and ease use of these devices have been hampered.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to further quantify the mechanical performance of mycological bio-composites that address the automotive and structural core industries, while concurrently scaling and demonstrating material production. The engineered composites market continues to grow steadily because of the high strength-to-weight and stiffness-to-weight ratios of these systems, as compared to conventional engineering materials. Engineered woods are ubiquitous in the construction and furniture industries, but due to domestic indoor air quality regulations (Toxic Substances Control Act), these materials are being phased out or are forced to use expensive formaldehyde-free adhesives. Similarly, the automotive industry is under regulatory pressure in Europe to find alternatives to fire-retardant foams that cannot be recycled due to inorganic filling agents. The technical results from the Phase I effort have demonstrated bio-composite materials which can compete both economically, and on mechanical performance, with the aforementioned competitors, while meeting these legislative demands. A preliminary cost analysis based on the process economics of our existing production facilities projects retail costs 45% and 35% below the current state-of-the-art in the automotive and furniture industries, respectively. We will work with key industry partners to meet performance metrics and demonstrate quality pilot production. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project would be a customizable bio-composite for a broad range of markets, including automotive, transportation, architectural, furniture, sports, and recreation. These materials are truly sustainable, since both the laminates and cores used in the sandwich structure consist of renewable materials. They also require significantly less energy to make than other biocompatible composites, because the material is grown instead of synthesized, and the material is completely compostable at the end of life. The outcome of the proposed development and demonstration will ensure that the bio-composite properties meet the requirements for the target markets. Furthermore, over the course of this grant, and in cooperation with Rensselaer and Union College, we will demonstrate and scale the best manufacturing processes to a pilot stage capable of manufacturing high volumes of quality product. Since these materials leverage regional lignocellulosic byproducts from domestic agriculture and industry, a regional manufacturing model is presently being pursued to reduce transportation and feedstock costs. This will not only bring additional value to U.S. agricultural markets, but will spur rural economic development through domestic manufacturing. Finally, these advanced biological materials represent a new paradigm in manufacturing, offering safe, biodegradable alternatives to traditional petroleum-based alternatives.",

If successful, it would be transformative in the clinical diagnosis of allergy diseases by enabling rapid evaluation at the doctor?s office in a format that is significantly preferable to skin-prick or challenge testing. The broader impacts of this research are the development of next generation diagnostic devices. These devices will enable the diagnosis of many different conditions and diseases with just a small drop of blood, right in a doctor?s office. Disease diagnosis from blood often requires that the blood sample, typically one or more test tubes full of blood, be taken from a vein in a patient?s arm and sent to a clinical laboratory. This is uncomfortable for the patient, requires them to wait days for results, is expensive, and is less safe than the approach being developed by Virogenomics because a large amount of blood that must be transported and handled. The Virogenomics platform will use just a drop of blood and will provide results while the patient is still in the doctor?s office. This diagnostic test works similar to the blood-glucose monitors diabetics use to monitor their blood sugar but is much more flexible in regards to the types of tests that can be done. In addition to allergy diagnosis, the proposed diagnostic platform would have application in many other fields that affect our health, such as diagnostics for autoimmune diseases, infectious disease and cancer.",

Iron and zinc phosphate chemicals are currently widely used in surface treatment processes, which require from 7 to 10 process steps, consume energy to heat treatment baths, and produce a large quantity of waste that must be treated. This adds cost, and results in phosphate discharge to the environment. Based on the Phase I project, a chromate- and phosphate-free pre-treatment chemical will be further developed in this project. This chemical reduces the number of pre-treatment process to less than 5 steps, can be used at ambient temperature, and produces 90% less waste. It is expected to demonstrate enhanced performance in corrosion protection and paint adhesion over similar products. The broader commercial impacts of this project will be to dramatically reduce cost, complexity and negative environmental impact of metal surface pretreatment in manufacturing processes without compromising performance. Potential applications will be in automobile, aerospace, steel (coil coatings), consumer electronics, appliance, and many other industries. An important societal impact will be the better protection to workers in plants, as this process is not toxic and does not require elaborate waste disposal procedures. This project will also enhance the scientific understanding of mechanisms by which pretreatments contribute to the protection of metals.",

The use of inexpensive production tools for music creation has reached a critical point and an opportunity now exists to facilitate a global, open, and free musical exchange directly between producer and consumer. Cloud computing offers the ability to facilitate this exchange in a highly scalable, capable, and cost efficient manner. Cloud computing also enables a cloud-based music consumption methodology which eliminates the consumer burdens of file management and backup while increasing accessibility.

Proof-of-concept has been demonstrated for a novel method of imaging DNA replication in vivo that is non-toxic and does not interfere with cellular metabolic processes. The method utilizes the unique specificity and high rate of reaction of bio-orthogonal ligation chemistry, and it has shown that in vivo labeling of DNA molecules with this novel bio-orthogonal mechanism yields fast, precise labeling of cell proliferation of cells in their natural environments. Most importantly, the method is minimally invasive, results in reliable incorporation of both the nucleotides and the label, and does not require cell lysis, DNA strand separations, or any of the abrasive treatments characteristic of cell proliferation assays currently on the market. The company plans to develop new methods for the usage of its technology with Fluorescently Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) protocols and testing different formats, such as tissues and different cell lines, for the applicability of this method. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project, if successful, is a Fluorescent Imaging Kit that can be routinely used with such advanced techniques as high content screening, high throughput screening for drug-discovery, and ADME-TOX assays, as well as with more traditional cell biology and molecular biology settings. The unique advantage of the proposed product is that it allows cell monitoring over prolonged time periods, up to several days. The product will have applications in multiple scientific disciplines, from cancer biology to stem cell biology, and streamline experimental protocols. The proposed assays are especially tailored to be fully compatible with high content screening, one of the major technologies at the forefront of personalized medicine, most notably in the field of oncology, and as such it will directly contribute to the advancement of new therapies, better diagnostics, and more efficient treatment plans. The method also will allow cutting costs of reagents by eliminating the need to repeat experiments multiple times to monitor different markers, and by streamlining research aspects of early stage drug discovery.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project proposes a robotic hand based on a novel torque-switching mechanism and patented miniature motor controllers. The mechanism actively channels motor torque along different transmission paths and enables dependant and independent (time-discreet) control of both finger joints in a robotic hand to perform both power and pinch grasps. There is a growing need in industry for adaptable and flexible manufacturing capabilities in a dynamic environment. Industry generally uses single-axis grippers and end-effectors that are modified to pick up specific items in a highly-controlled environment. This requires exchanging multiple customized and expensive grippers via tool-changers. This project?s goal is to produce a paradigm shift in the materials-handling industry by introducing a highly flexible, affordable, and lightweight robotic gripper that can grasp and manipulate objects of varying size, shape, and stiffness. The Phase-II project objectives are to design and develop a prototype 3-fingered gripper using a novel torque-switching mechanism, optimized motors, multiple feedback sensors, and miniature control electronics, and to test and evaluate the prototype gripper in an industrial setting. This program will result in a compact, lightweight, and affordable robotic hand capable of grasping and manipulating a large range of objects. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project addresses the shortcomings of gripper devices available today which discourage the use of robotic systems, thereby undermining manufacturing productivity. The proposed solution improves manufacturing competitiveness by enabling easier adoption of robotic work cells in conventional markets such as light manufacturing and emerging markets such as the food and beverage industry. The societal impact will be felt in the field of education where robotics is recognized as a strategic motivator for children and young adults to enter into technical fields. Most robots are too large and dangerous to bring into a classroom. The proposed robotic hand will be very portable, safe, and exciting for both educators and students. A significant increase in gripper dexterity will make it an even more attractive motivator in the classroom and other secondary educational programs and workshops. A potential secondary application for this innovation is a more dexterous and lightweight hand prosthesis which could have a major societal impact. Finally, the ability to transmit torque through different paths in a miniature package and allow control of different functions with a single small actuator enables lightweight yet versatile machines and could have impacts beyond the field of robotics.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop and commercialize an integrated system to actively stabilize an optical microscope to the precision required by today&#039;s cutting-edge imaging methods. Microscopy in the biological sciences is undergoing radical advancement on several fronts. &quot;Super-Resolution&quot; (SR) techniques circumvent the diffraction limit on resolution once thought to be insurmountable, and promise the ability to image the structures and processes of cell biology at the molecular level. This will usher in profound advancements in the understanding of the inner-workings of the cell. However, significant interrelated barriers remain in the path towards widespread use of SR techniques: (1) they are technically challenging and (2) expensive to implement; and (3) they place physical demands on the microscope platform it was not designed to meet. Foremost of these demands is that SR methods require control over the movement of the biological sample and the stability of the microscope system with nanometer precision. This commercialized integrated system is designed specifically to address these issues and remove these barriers. It uses a 3-axis, piezo-driven nanopositioning stage to control sample motion and actively maintains the stability of the system using the image as the reference point for this stability. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project lies in making SR methods routinely useful to working biologists. These &quot;game-changing&quot; tools will advance our understanding of the molecular bases of disease pathologies, and enable far more exacting methods aimed at their treatments. The new insights will range from those in molecular virology and the development of safer and more effective vaccines, to the molecular mechanisms of neuronal signaling and learning and memory. In fact, it is hard to imagine an area of cell biology that will not be impacted by these emerging SR techniques. One of the pioneers of these methods has likened them to the Hubble telescope: they enable people to see things they simply could not see before. This analogy goes further: there is only one Hubble telescope, and currently very few SR-capable imaging systems, due to both the technical and economic barriers to their routine use. And while SR methods expose the physical limitations of microscopes in an acute manner, their stability and image acquisition requirements are not unique. Thus, this commercial system will be much more broadly useful: it will also enable focal-stability and molecular tracking at the nanometer-scale for any long-term imaging experiment.",

This media addresses issues caused by nutrient-related pollution, which significantly affects drinking water supplies, aquatic life and recreational water quality. Phosphorus comes primarily from agriculture and waste treatment sources, including on-site generated wastewater and is the limiting nutrient that usually controls eutrophication in temperate climates. Better, low maintenance/ lower cost approaches are needed to reduce discharge levels. In Phase I, the feasibility of a high performance phosphorous removal media was demonstrated, showing a sorption capacity that is significantly greater than other media reported in the literature. The feasibility of phosphorous recovery and media regeneration was also shown. In Phase II, the sorption of the media will be improved further and will be tested in both the laboratory and as add-on tertiary systems that will be designed, fabricated and operated in the field with the help of commercialization partners. Scale up of manufacturing and regeneration processes will be examined. Successful completion will lead to a superior phosphorous removal media and data required for commercial introduction of products that are needed for wide scale commercialization into the market. The broader impacts of this research are that phosphorus originating from smaller on-site wastewater systems and water runoff from agricultural and other locations is becoming recognized as a major cause of impairment to streams and lakes and degradation of the water bodies like the Florida everglades. Efficient, low maintenance technologies are needed to reduce discharge levels and a lack of effective solutions exists today. Removing phosphorus is common at municipal wastewater treatment plants where chemical flocculation is available, but such approaches are impractical for dispersed sources of generated wastewater. Lower cost approaches are also desirable for these municipal treatment plants. This new media will have a much higher capacity and longer life. This will provide an economic alternative to mitigate the negative effects that phosphorous has on the environment and will offer ways for recovering the economic value of the phosphorous, a non-renewable resource that is necessary for food production and which is becoming limited in supply. Further development and optimization is warranted to move toward verification in field trials that will accelerate the commercial use of this new phosphorous removal technology.",

Because of its flexibility, modularity, and reconfigurability iMobot is an ideal platform for many research and teaching programs at colleges and universities. iMobot allows researchers to study artificial intelligence, swarm technology, robot collaboration, mobile networking, sensor fusion, gait simulation, and programming for re-configurability. Each module has am open architecture, with a processor capable of embedded Linux. Users can customize software and accessories for their specific needs. Proposed product feasibility research includes adaptable connectivity between modules, intelligent plug-and-play sensors, a robust and lightweight chassis, along with re-configurability. In this proposed Phase II project, a professional design team will develop necessary technology related to assembling into clusters including mechanical design, electrical interface, sensors, algorithms, control and control software and customer interface. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is great. This proposed project will be one of the first attempts to scale up an intelligent reconfigurable modular robot for commercial deployment. The initial market for iMobot will be for university research and teaching. With a standardized hardware base using an open architecture users will be able to more widely share their work with each other, and create a valuable open educational resource. The future release of different iMobot versions will be for life-saving rescue and search operations in the first responder system, and for K-12 education. Robotics is an interdisciplinary field. The unique full mobility and reconfigurability of iMobot are very appealing. Modules can be used alone or in collaboration with others, making it a flexible and scalable educational tool. Because of the homogeneous nature of modular robotics, the cost of manufacturing is reduced through production of a large volume of similar parts. By introducing students to interesting robotic projects with affordable hardware platforms, which involve a variety of math, physics, information technology, and engineering principles, we can excite their imagination and give them confidence to pursue STEM careers, especially for underrepresented and economically disadvantaged groups.",

The design and use of novel probes to study structure and function at the molecular and subcellular level in living cells is a topic of great importance, with a growing need for new approaches and tools to visualize not only the distribution of molecular species in cells, but the manner in which they interact. Protein-protein interactions and other dynamic events within cells have been largely invisible, but will be increasingly observable with new imaging modalities. In particular, lanthanide probes, with the dramatic lowering of background achieved through time-gating can enable new microscopic imaging, if successfully coupled with cell penetration and molecular targeting and recognition. This new scientific capability is certain to have significant commercial appeal and adoption in the basic science and medical research markets.",

Components printed with existing conductive inks are challenged by repeated flexing cycles that can break conductive paths. In this project, a graphene filler technology and a novel formulation will be used to achieve the combination of electrical, mechanical, and environmental durability properties specified for the flexible printed electronics at a price point that enables high-volume applications. The broader/commercial impact of this project will be the availability of a conductive ink that meets performance requirements of next-generation printed electronics. The printed electronics market is growing across multiple sectors driven by applications including radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags for tracking inventory, smart packaging for anti-theft and anti-tampering purposes, smart cards and printed displays. Conductive inks are a critical component in printed electronics, and limitations of existing conductive inks have curtailed market growth. The new graphene-based conductive inks are expected to demonstrate flexibility and mechanical robustness that improves lifetime and performance of printed electronics, while providing significant cost advantage over silver-based inks currently widely used in printed electronics industry.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop an on-line analyzer to enable the increased use of alternative fuels in cement manufacturing, and thus reduce energy costs. Cement manufacturing is highly energy-intensive, accounting for a significant portion of fuel use in the world. The rising cost of energy has motivated cement manufacturers to use alternative fuels available at low or no cost (e.g., tires, municipal waste etc.). However, the use of alternative fuels creates manufacturing problems due to the lack of adequate and timely analysis feedback. In this project, a Rapid Clinker Analyzer (RCA) will be designed, built and evaluated to demonstrate that the system captures and analyzes data in a much faster and cost-effective manner to allow cement manufacturers to analyze product clinker in near-real time. The broader/commercial impact of this project will be the potential to significantly increase the use of alternative fuels in cement manufacturing. Widespread adoption of this technology will result in significant savings to cement manufacturers, while greatly reducing the use of fossil fuels. In addition, the shift to alternative fuels will reduce landfills, and thus mitigate negative environmental impacts of waste products. This new technology will also provide a unique advancement in analyzer technology because of the more rapid performance and smaller sample required.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a revolutionary approach to the lens and opto-mechanical design and fabrication process for long wave infrared (LWIR) imagers with the goal of reducing cost, size, and weight. To date, the high cost of sensors has made LWIR imagers accessible only in markets where performance -not cost - is the driving factor, allowing expensive and bulky optics to reign. New process improvements are significantly reducing the size and cost of LWIR microbolometer sensors, making optics the limiting factor for weight, size, and cost reduction. The research objectives are to extend the technology developed in Phase I and validate the final manufacturing and testing process for the optics and camera assembly to show that the final architecture can meet the market requirements for module volume, weight and price when scaled to high volume production. The development will scale the process to larger arrays and will take the necessary steps to evaluate the solutions mechanical reliability. The solution will be implemented and tested through arrangements with industry partners. The anticipated result is a demonstration of an LWIR camera that meets the needs of the infrared (IR) vision enhancement and thermography markets. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to extend the sale of IR imagers into cost-sensitive commercial applications. Currently IR imagers are targeted for expensive military applications, but there is a large need for reduced cost systems in safety, security, and industrial markets where thermal imaging offers enhanced viewing over the visible spectrum. Thermal imagers provide visibility in complete darkness, which enables imaging in adverse conditions needed by automotive collision detection, search and rescue and security applications that require identification of humans in conditions of no light. In industrial use, LWIR thermography can improve energy efficiency by identifying thermal leaks and can predict imminent process faults. The impact to society is as ubiquitous as the commercial opportunities and constitutes an increase in emergency search effectiveness, city street safety, and energy conservation. The scientific and technological understanding cannot be understated: technological innovation occurs most rapidly near manufacturing capability. Already, labor costs are driving current labor-intensive IR lens fabrication overseas. The proposed innovations remove the labor-intensive component, bolstering the US as the dominant manufacturer in this emerging market while enhancing science in parallel process development, material property innovation, and IR sensor performance.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Current and future space systems will continue to grow in complexity and capabilities, creating a formidable challenge to monitor, maintain, and utilize these systems and manage their growing network of space and related ground-based assets.  Integrated System Health Management (ISHM), and in particular, Condition-Based System Health Management (CBHM), is the ability to manage and maintain a system using dynamic real-time data to prioritize, optimize, maintain, and allocate resources.  A complete, modern CBHM system comprises a number of functional capabilities: sensing and data acquisition; signal processing; conditioning and health assessment; diagnostics and prognostics; and decision reasoning.  In addition, an intelligent Human System Interface (HSI) is required to provide the user/analyst with relevant context-sensitive information, the system condition, and its effect on overall situational awareness.  During Phase I, the CEI team researched and designed a network architecture encapsulating intelligent software agent technology for CBHM data collection, processing, and space system management: LAASAM.  The architecture significantly enhances an analyst&quot;s ability to make timely, effective decisions and take actions to protect, and maximize the utility of, US Space Assets.  In Phase II, the CEI team will develop a prototype system based upon that architecture and demonstrate its CBHM and space situational awareness capabilities.  BENEFIT:  CEI has developed software and hardware technologies for a variety of government programs, and the team has transitioned over 37 products to production for use in DoD and Government systems.  CEI also has experience commercializing technology developed under Government-funded programs.  Products are packaged as COTS items, listed on a catalog price sheet, supported with technical application notes and marketing materials, and made available for sale to both the commercial and Government markets.  CEI will promote technologies developed under this effort as part of its standard commercial product marketing and sales activities.  As further evidence of CEI&quot;s success with commercialization of SBIR technology, the Small Business Administration recently presented CEI the 2011 Tibbetts Award.  This prestigious award is presented to small businesses that represent excellence in achieving the mission and goals of the SBIR and STTR program, stimulate technological innovation, and increase commercialization of Federal research.    The LAASAM technology developed under this program will realize condition-based health management for enhanced situational awareness of a wide variety of space-based assets and supporting ground equipment.  A key platform target for Phase III transition is the next generation Global Positioning System Control Segment (GPS OCX) program awarded to Raytheon.  Raytheon anticipates leveraging CEI&quot;s LAASAM architecture to help address the program&quot;s requirement for condition-based health management.  GPS OCX is the 3rd generation GPS information processing system and requires extensive provisioning, health monitoring, prognostics, and distributed diagnostic capability.  LAASAM also has commercial applications.  Major market segments include the oil and gas industry, network management within the telecommunications industry, transportation/logistics providers, and commercial space. The CEI marketing team has made contact with key players in the oil and gas industry and is executing a marketing plan to develop these commercial sales opportunities during Phase II.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  There are currently no antennas available for handheld receivers or other military systems that efficiently cover the full GNSS spectrum with broad, stable patterns and consistent performance over frequency.  During the first phase of this program we designed, optimized and built working hardware of a wideband design covering the full 1160  1600 MHz spectrum.  The antenna is very compact and can fold and stow inside a handheld receiver.  The antenna is configured with a Low Noise Amplifier and power biasing circuitry, and can also be configured to support dual polarizations.  The RF performance and efficiency push the Chu-Harrington limits for this size aperture.    FIRST RF has paid careful attention to the integration details, manufacturing approach and overall affordability of the antenna.  The design adheres to our core manufacturing principles, which means the design can remain cost competitive with overseas manufacturers in a production environment.  In Phase II, FIRST RF will optimize the RF design through computer modeling and simulation, and engineering prototype construction.  We will advance the design through to a TRL 6-7 by performing environmental and operational tests. These include thermal, vibration and EMI tests as needed.  BENEFIT:  There are currently no antennas available for handheld receivers or other military systems that efficiently cover the full GNSS spectrum with broad, stable patterns and consistent performance over frequency.  The proposed technology offers the RF performance and stowability required for handheld applications, as well as the stable amplitude and phase performance over frequency and angle required by CRPAs.  The antenna can be configured to offer dual Right Hand and Left Hand Polarization for earth science and other missions.  Finally, the technology adheres to manufacturing principles which render it cost competitive with price targets for volume electronics manufacturing.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Voss Scientific proposes to develop an Automated Susceptibility Test Assembly (ASTA) which will be capable of efficiently determining preferred electromagnetic (EM) source waveforms for inducing effects in target electronic systems.  This novel adaptive approach will potentially discover unique waveforms that substantially reduce the intensity of the microwave illumination required to cause upset in electronic systems.  The potential benefits of this technique include smaller High Power Microwave (HPM) sources, longer stand-off ranges, more reliable results, improved hardening methods, and reduced collateral effects on unintended targets.  By reducing the required intensity, missions scenarios which were previously impractical will be within reach.  ASTA system utilizes a fully integrated, computer controlled hardware set, highly agile in both the frequency and time domains, to generate the irradiating EM fields.   The hardware is controlled by an intelligent test automation application, which employs a novel rule-based execution scheme that combines both traditional test matrices and optimization algorithms. A broad suite of diagnostics will be implemented for damage assessment, including sensors, custom software resident on the asset, remote EM emission sensing, and asset specific diagnostic boards.  The Phase II work will conclude with a demonstration of an automated test at L-band on multiple versions of fully instrumented assets.  BENEFIT:  The capability to explore the RF illumination parameter space with both increased breadth and detail using an automated system will provide substantial benefit to both the military HPM community and the commercial electronics industry.  The primary benefit to the military is the capability to identify and exploit susceptibilities, allowing performance of previously impossible HPM and EW missions.  ASTA testing can also provide the information needed to improve RF shielding and hardening for US systems, providing an increased confidence level on battlefield operations.  In addition, the customized waveform produced by the system is unique to the target asset class.  This greatly reduces the probability of undesired collateral effects on unintended targets.  The commercial EMI industry will also benefit from improved hardening capabilities provided by this approach and by the general test automation methodology.  The improved efficiency and reduced manpower required for susceptibility and EMI compliance tests will be an advantage to both military and commercial users.",

To achieve these objectives, the design, assembly and deployment of unmanned spacecraft supporting DoD space missions must be radically overhauled to resemble a modular production and integration process.  One significant focus of the current ORS need is to address thermal management systems.  In this Air Force Phase II SBIR, IST proposes the continued development and validation of a reconfigurable, versatile and rapidly installable thermal control system (TCS).  IST&quot;s active thermal tile (ATT) TCS is designed to be highly compatible with current and future ORS platforms, has built-in failsafe electronics, is robust to launch conditions, and efficiently and effectively performs thermal transfer.  Not only will the ATT system meet the operational and performance requirements set forth by the ORS office, it will eliminate the need for specific thermal analysis and design of each component interface, in-series development with other systems, design of unique spacecraft-level TCS, and detail verification.  The proposed Phase II effort will focus on completion of the IST ATT system such that cost, form factor and architecture versatility for the ORS mission are optimized.  BENEFIT:  The ATT technology represents a fundamental building block for future DOD small tactical satellites, whose use is expected to increase drastically in coming years as the US military moves towards more responsive and/or expendable space assets.

Our proposed Near-Optimal Matrix Completion (NOMC) target to provide a leading approach that can improve the matrix completion accuracy. Two types of data matrix are considered. The first type is that the matrix is low rank or can be explicitly transferred to a low rank, i.e., a Euclidean distance matric converted from object locations. Our primarily experimental results for such a type demonstrate that NOMC recovers a low-rank matrix with only 10% samples while achieving the Frobenius error less than 10%. The second type is that the matrix is high rank, such as an arbitrary image. Our initial result shows that NOMC reconstructs the original image with high quality from the downsampled image while 50% image pixels are randomly removed. This also says that NOMC could reconstruct the image clearly even if 50% image pixels are randomly lost, removed, contaminated, or corrupted.

The flight test demonstrations will include autonomous testing that utilizes the G &amp; C algorithms implemented onto custom autopilot hardware. Barron Associates has teamed with Virginia Commonwealth University UAV Group to develop a low-cost integrated navigation hardware/software solution. In addition to the flight test efforts, Barron Associates will perform a manufacturing analysis to determine unit production costs.",

        "abstract": "Skeletal muscle injury is a significant challenge to warfighters due to the severity of the injuries often caused by Improvised Explosive Devices.  Currently, there are few viable clinical treatment options for these types of injuries.  Keratin hydrogels offer a solution to these challenges as carriers of cells and growth factors.  Human epithelial keratins are the major structural proteins in cells and form a cytoplasmic network of intermediate filaments. Human hair keratins are genetically similar to epithelial keratins and their intrinsic characteristics make them unique candidates for biomaterial-based carriers of growth factors and cells. In the Phase I project, we showed that keratin hydrogels provide sustained release of growth factors and maintain cell viability in vivo.  This Phase II proposal will build on these findings and move toward a product that facilitates skeletal muscle regeneration. The Phase II objectives are to optimize formulations of keratin for delivery of cells and supporting growth factors (FGF and IGF-1), to test the safety and immunogenicity of these formulations, and to assess the functional muscle recovery in two rodent models of muscle loss. Completion of the Phase II objectives will yield a keratin hydrogel formulation optimized for in vivo regeneration of injured skeletal muscle.",

        "abstract": "The necessity of Trust has been pressed upon the United States Department of Defense as a consequence of the globalization of microelectronics development and manufacturing.  Many of the microelectronic devices used in DOD systems and much of the software used in the design of such systems are either manufactured overseas or otherwise have foreign influence on their development.  Even when devices are designed in the US, they are commonly fabricated overseas.  The urgent question is thus raised: how does the DOD trust the increasingly more complex microelectronic devices fielded in critical systems?  Given the massive scale of the global shift to non-U.S. microelectronics fabrication, it is prohibitively expensive for DOD to solve this trend exclusively through the use of Trusted Foundries and U.S.-only design and manufacturing facilities.  Luna Innovations Incorporated has an arsenal of proven tools that provide trust in the development tools and manufacturing chain of FPGA devices.  In this project, Luna will extend those capabilities to robustly support trust evaluation of Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) created by untrusted fabrication facilities.  Luna has been involved in Trust research for seven years as a prime contractor on both Trust-related SBIRs as well as the ongoing DARPA Trust BAA.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  This Phase II SBIR Project is aimed at development and successful demonstration of a working prototype of an active non-lethal infrasound avian denial system using infrasound energy based upon the Phase I results. The primary purpose of the system is to deny birds access to critical areas around aircraft and other high value system and avoid collision between aircraft and birds during daily flight operations without impacting mission requirements through detection and denial actions. Those actions have the side benefit of preventing other forms of damage caused by birds nesting and perching in unwanted areas. The system meets the technological challenge of detecting birds flying into an area where there is the potential for collision with an aircraft using a passive infrasound capability for detection of their presence then using non-lethal active infrasound capability to effectively repel the birds. The infrasound frequency range will not interfere with any current operational aircraft or ground-based sensor systems and shall not be able to target personnel.  BENEFIT:  The system developed for military aircrafts can be used as a non-lethal avian active denial system at commercial aviation facilities in areas that have high concentrations of birds that pose a threat to aircraft from bird-strikes and/or aircraft/facility damage, communication towers, energy wind-driven windmills and harbors and shipyards. The system can be adapted for protection of farms and crops, reduction of feral pigeon population in public squares, deterrence of feral pigeons from nesting on ledges of historic buildings and protection of open swimming pools and recreational areas, including man-made ponds.",

        "abstract": "Motion sickness is of concern in the transport of troops, be it by air, by land, or by sea. Motion sickness affects the ability to function at the peak of performance, which is particularly important for troops immersed in theatre. Despite the potential difficulties that can be incited by motion sickness, armed forces are frequently subjected to situations that can bring on motion sickness. Driving under indirect-vision driving (IVD) conditions is particularly disposed to result in motion sickness. To date the only proven methods for reducing symptoms of motion sickness are pharmacological and thus, are of limited use to armed forces. Pharmaceuticals must be taken in advance of transport, a luxury of time our troops dont always have. Moreover, they typically have associated cognitive effects which last long after transportation is completed. Our promising on-demand, non-pharmacological method of mitigating motion sickness, will be of considerable aid to our troops driving under IVD conditions, enabling them to reach destinations and complete missions without the adverse and prolonged effects of either motion sickness or traditional treatments. We completed a fully functional prototype of the system during the Phase I effort and are poised to demonstrate its efficacy in laboratory and field tests.",

In Phase II, we propose to optimize this design between the three competing factors resistive losses/coolant requirements, cable size, and flexibility. The cable system will be designed to deliver the 5-6 mega-amps required by tactical railguns. The cable terminations will be designed to integrate with the limited space allowed at the launcher for these electrical connections.

For the same reasons, assuring safety after cleaning decontaminated sites can be challenging. Currently available technologies require considerable labor, and results typically cannot be obtained before 24 V 48 hours up to 7 days. Therefore, a system that can detect the effectiveness at a shorter period in a less labor-intensive manner can lessen the burdens of decontamination. Desired traits for such a system are: 1) suitable simulants for B. anthracis spores, 2) various materials for spore strips, 3) simple and rapid, 4) quantitative, and 5) portable. Our rapid and quantitative biological indicator system with B. thuringiensis Al Hakam spore strips will assess the viability of the spores quantitatively within 1 V 4 hours. The materials for spore strips will have various porosities and hydrophobicities. We expect that the size of the system will be 30 cm (W) e 25 cm (D) e 10 cm (H) with the weight around 3 kg.

The microchip was demonstrated to be appropriate for acquisition of THz-frequency spectroscopic features from bio-molecules (e.g., DNA, RNA, proteins) in solution and solid forms. Spectroscopic characterization of biological species inside nanofluidic channels with high sensitivity and high spectral and spatial resolution was demonstrated. In Phase II, a completely functioning nanofluidic sensor platform will be developed, tested, and refined in combination with a THz spectroscopic system. The focus of Phase II will be further developments on the inexpensive nanofluidic technology toward future commercialization  and fabrication of an associated interface device to provide a packaged platform, readily interfaced with THz spectroscopy instruments, including commercially available systems.

In Phase II, ITC proposes to determine the best concentrator alternative and develop a robust TaSC prototype demonstrator that is mounted on a Light Tactical Trailer and includes a near-commercial 3.5-kWe free-piston Stirling engine from close collaborator Infinia Corporation. As a result of leveraging the advanced status of ITC/Infinia CST system technology development, this Phase II demonstration system embodies all of the Phase II and most of the Phase III goals identified in the original OSD SBIR topic.

        "abstract": "An automated, closed loop individualized system for administration of analgesic and anesthetic medication to patients is proposed in order to ensure vigilant, optimized care, especially in special circumstances when a large number of trauma patients must be treated simultaneously by a limited number of medical personnel. The result is improved pain management, safety, outcome, and reduced complications such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The Deployable Analgesia Administration System (DAAU) optimally sets the infusion rate and rapidly delivers an initial bolus, based on a population pharmacokinetic approach and employs feedback from vital signs monitoring and automated mental status assessment, as well as a novel means to actively query the brain to monitor analgesic/anesthetic depth, in order to safely oversee infusion. A staged product development is proposed, moving from automatic analgesia/anesthesia delivery to the conscious patient, to infusion of medication into patients whose level of consciousness is diminished either by their injuries or requirement for surgical depth of anesthesia.  Phase II consists of (1) verification of biomarkers which reflect patient status and their incorporation into medication infusion algorithms, (2) construction and verification of function of a Deployable Autonomous Analgesia Unit (DAAU) prototype, (3) preclinical verification of safety of DAAU in established animal models receiving analgesia/anesthesia from the DAAU, (4) further investigation of a noninvasive sensor for monitoring analgesic/anesthetic depth (as the DAAU adjusts infusion), (5) risk management, and (6) testing to assess ease of use and setup.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, many human-computer interaction and virtual environment systems have incorporated haptic devices. However, the range of environment properties and types of interactions enabled by existing haptic interfaces are very limited. Haptic feedback is typically restricted to that provided by artificial materials (e.g., mannequins) or resolved forces (e.g., use of PHANTOM-type force feedback haptic interfaces in virtual reality simulators). The user normally grasps a stylus or places a fingertip in a thimble, which is represented as a tool in the virtual environment. There is a need for medical simulators that integrate the cutaneous sensations of direct interaction with typical kinesthetic feedback in order to provide a complete haptic experience. To address this need, Intelligent Automation, Inc. (IAI), in collaboration with Dr. Allison Okamura at Stanford University, Tangible Haptics, and Dr. Carla Pugh (Northwestern University), proposes to extend our Phase I successes developing a hands-free kinetic system for medical simulation, KineSys MedSim, that accurately simulates kinesthetic and cutaneous properties (e.g. stiffness, friction, texture, temperature, etc.) of skin, bone, muscle, and internal organs (which may have hard inclusions such as tumors). The proposed innovation in this SBIR effort will provide a solution for next-generation surgical simulators.",

The functions performed by the iPTK will include sensor motion compensation, clutter suppression, on-line statistical modeling, multiple-target track-before-detect filtering, and data visualization. These functions will implement algorithms based on optimal Bayesian mathematics and semi-parametric spatial-temporal image processing techniques, building upon successful development and demonstration in Phase I.

By the end of Phase II, the iPTK will have been matured to a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 6. Extensive testing and performance evaluations will be included in Phase II, to enhance and demonstrate the capabilities of the iPTK.

Multi-spectral ZnS has high transparency in a wide spectral range (0.4 m to 12 m). It is the material of choice for long wave-infrared and semi-active laser domes. The current method of preparation typically uses Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD). However ZnS CVD has relatively low hardness which limits its use especially for air-borne military systems where particle or rain erosion may occur. A sintered compact powder by hot pressing nanoparticles prepared through a green process will eliminate the use of toxic chemicals and decrease the cost of ZnS while improving its mechanical and optical properties. During the Phase I project Lynntech developed a low temperature, green process for production of ZnS nanoparticles. This process is easily scalable and its simplicity will have an impact on the final goal cost of $500/kg of ZnS will be achieved. The goal of the Phase II project will be to demonstrate synthesis rates between 2-10 kg of nanopowder material on a daily basis with emphasis on purity (99.99%) and uniform size distribution.",

Silver-Zinc batteries provide high energy and power density cells, and since the electrolyte is a water-based alkaline fluid, provide a comparatively safe battery. A disadvantage to this technology is large format cells, which are required to provide high power, do not provide comparable cycle life performance to competing systems. There are two main issues. One is the negative electrode, having redox products being zinc and zinc oxide, experiences non-uniform re-plating of the zinc upon charging. The mass tends toward the bottom of the current collector as the cell accumulates cycles. The other issue is the separator, commonly used cellophane, experiences degradation due to the strongly oxidative positive silver oxide electrode. The primary work will be to advance from the Phase I to the Phase II the further refinements of circumventing the shortcomings of silver/zinc. This includes incorporating binders with the negative electrodes to limit dissolution of the electrode while cycling and developing a non-cellulosic cellophane replacement. Also included will be advances in thermal pathway to remove heat from cells during discharge and providing an advanced silver/zinc battery management system.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  A proposal for a Phase II effort that continues the development of a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) based tool for the prediction of bulk residual stresses, started under the Phase I effort, is presented.  The key objective in this proposal is to improve the numerical heat transfer methods explored in Phase I via experimentation,  theoretical development, and validation.  Small scale boiling experiments are suggested for improving the understanding of sub cooled oil boiling heat transfer.  In particular, specific experiments are proposed for improving the understanding of nucleate site density, bubble departure size, transition boiling characteristics and film boiling vapor thickness.  The experimental activities will provide an additional foundation that will be used to improve the understanding of the physics of boiling oil and help determine improved sub grid scale heat transfer relationships.  Additional data for validating the methods will be collected in a pilot-scale facility on a full-size and representative part.  An initial release of the software tool is expected at the end of the project, providing a solid foundation for a commercial CFD-based software product.  BENEFIT:  The primary benefits of the research outlined in this proposal is the development of an engineering software tool capable of predicting heat transfer on a forged part during the quenching process.  Currently, there are no Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) software tools available for reliably approximating heat transfer during an oil quenching process.  The proposed simulation tool is expected to improve the quality and reduce the costs of manufactured metal parts.  In particular, it is expected that the software will provide the necessary tools for engineers to reduce post-heat treat machining and improve the uniformity of part material properties.    The commercial product resulting from the proposed research will be the foundations of a software tool  that can be applied to a number of parts manufactured for private and military applications.  Parts for the military such as turbine disks, large bulk heads, helicopter gears and large gun barrels are some of the items that would benefit from design work that included the application of the software.  The automotive industry utilizes large quantities of heat treated parts.  Since the corporate culture in this industry is to design in part quality rather than inspecting for the desired part quality it could also benefit from the proposed design tool.",

These video sensors provide considerable amounts of data for exploitation, suitable for various types of assisted and autonomous processing including target tracking, aimpoint generation, forensic analysis, and behavioral characterization. Generally the smaller UAVs do not have existing sensor models and sensor pointing direction may not be well known. These limitations make associating accurate position information with the full motion video (FMV) difficult using current techniques. Under previous SBIR funding, ISL developed the Full Motion Video Georegistration Application (FMVGA) to automatically produce georegistered FMV, i.e. a three-dimensional geoposition coordinate (latitude, longitude, and elevation) associated with every pixel of the video without the requirement for an associated sensor model or platform position information. In the proposed program, ISL will implement improvements identified by users during the evaluation process.

The one limiting factor restricting the speed at which a scramjet can operate relates directly to the time it takes for the fuel and air to mix and burn.  Using hydrogen as the fuel source brings this time to a minimum.  Due to the low density and storability issues associated with high pressure gas and cryogenic liquid many government programs have limited the operational speed to circumvent the issue.  The Team recognizes the unique requirements for the development of H2 compounds that can conform to any tank geometry and provide long shelf life without the need for additional support hardware.

        "abstract": "Bistatic radar processing by airborne signals intelligence (SIGINT) and other intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance (ISR) platforms affords covert, passive exploitation of adversary or own-force radar systems to improve tactical situational awareness and fused intelligence products. Traditionally these bistatic signals have been ignored or unexploited by existing SIGINT/ELINT. The bistatic signals, however, contain a rich set of radar returns from both targets and cultural and natural features (i.e., clutter) that can be used to improve emitter geolocation as well as provide covert surveillance of enemy aircraft. Exploiting the bistatic signals, however, requires both novel signal processing algorithms and advanced processing architectures that can meet the challenging computing requirements for extracting the information contained in the bistatic returns. Under a successful Phase I effort, ISL established feasibility of the bistatic processing concept by showing that advanced intelligence products can be extracted from the bistatic clutter returns in a computer with a form factor that is appropriate for integration on an airborne SIGINT collection platform. The proposed Phase II program will refine the processing concept developed in Phase I and show that it can be implemented in low-cost hardware.",

        "abstract": "To address the NAVAIR need for advanced avionics data recorders, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) developed a new Automatic Real-Time, Reconfigurable interface Generalization Hardware (ARRGH) multiprotocol data recorder. The Phase I ARRGH design is based on innovative integration of hybrid transcoding hardware, RAID-based mass storage, and intelligent transcoding heuristic software. This 40 W (50% of competition) 11 lb (about 1/3 of competition) design offers seamless on-the-fly rerouting and data translation of input signals to/from the data recorder irrespective of interfaces involved. A plug-and-play self-sealing (environmentally protected) removable memory unit (RMU) allows rapid upgrades to avert obsolescence by leveraging commercial solid-state memories. The TRL-4 Phase I prototype includes shell adapters ensuring form-factor compliance with a variety of current data recorders (including the RM-6000f on F/A-18). It provides 1TB of removable memory, sustained write speeds of 550MBps (2700MBps burst) and has a built-in self-test, thus meeting NAVAIR (PMA-265 and others) performance requirements. In Phase II, POC will advance this development to produce a fully functional ground-tested year-1 prototype and a TRL-6 flight-test-ready year-2 prototype, define a platform integration roadmap, and initiate device certification. Successful Phase I demonstration has enabled POC to attract prime contractors as potential Phase II/III commercialization partners, including General Dynamics.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase-II project develops advanced technology capabilities for constructing and deploying client-adapted automated language translation systems within commercial settings that are used by globalizing enterprises and the language service provider companies (LSPs) that provide translation services to such enterprise clients. The developed technology leverages databases of previously-translated material in order to produce client-adapted high-quality fully-automatic translations for commercial language service providers (LSPs) and their enterprise clients. This approach provides a scalable and less-costly solution for creating and deploying client-specific customized Machine Translation (MT) engines. Once deployed, these customized MT systems expand the capabilities of clients to translate volumes of content that are not feasible to translate using current methods. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project lies in the impact that it will have on the broad commercial translation industry. The technology developed in the project is likely to significantly reduce barriers to wide-spread adoption of MT technology by the broad LSP industry and their enterprise client-base. The 2010 commercial translation market is a $26 billion industry, growing at a healthy pace. Current commercial MT offerings are expensive and too difficult to deploy for most enterprises and service providers. Free web-based translation services serve casual users, but do not meet the quality and security needs of enterprises. The technology developed in this project and the cloud-based delivery model support scalable, easy-to-integrate MT services, which are highly attractive to a broad range of potential clients. This approach will support cost-effective content generation into multiple target languages at a massive scale, a capability that is essential for globalizing US enterprises in order to compete in the information-rich market place of the 21st century.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project aims to develop a commercial optically-resonant nanotweezer chip and corresponding instrumentation. The nanotweezer technology, originally developed at Cornell University, uses localized optical forces to directly manipulate biological (nucleic acids &amp; proteins) and non-biological (nanoparticles) materials as small as a few nanometers in size. Efforts will be focused on developing a commercial system which facilitates the study of single-molecule interactions, as this sector has immediate market appeal and is experiencing very high growth. At present, research into the understanding of how single molecules interact is greatly impeded by the lack of a fast and simple technique which can: (1) capture and suspend small molecules in free solution for an indefinite period of time, (2) effectively &quot;concentrate&quot; the set of molecules of interest to a point where protein-protein or other multi-molecule interactions can be studied, and (3) allow rapid modulation of the external environmental conditions. The nanotweezer product line to be developed here, consisting of optical chips which carry the core technology, as well as a driving instrument, represents a quick and cost-effective system that allows researchers to solve all three of these problems simultaneously. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be a commercially-available product that can directly manipulate extremely small biomolecules and particles, and could be transformative to scientific and industrial advancement in a number of areas including: (1) the understanding of faulty protein-protein events and other single-molecule interactions, (2) the analysis of individual nucleic acids for rapid sequencing, and (3) the directed assembly of new forms of nanomaterials for energy production. The importance of the first item (which is the target application for the initial version of this platform) is highlighted by the large number of sufferers of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer&#039;s and Parkinson&#039;s, which are diseases that have been linked by protein misfolding events. The development of tools that can facilitate experimental studies of how single biomolecules and small aggregates interact can reveal information about the fundamental molecular processes that lead to these deficiencies. The nanotweezer technology has a series of key advantages over existing commercial methods that can enable researchers to better understand these phenomena in environments closer to the physiological state. We believe that these advantages will create a significant commercial advantage over competing products.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)Phase II project will develop a low-cost smart-window technology. This project will utilize contemporary display industry fabrication and processing technologies to create unique large-area optical films. These films will be subsequently used to construct energy-efficient smart windows that modulate transmission or reflection of light on command. Windows, skylights, and other glazings made with this technology will have the ability to darken on command. In this Phase II project, window-size prototypes will be designed, constructed and evaluated. Production, material costs, and prototype operation will be considered. Successful fabrication of these prototypes will enable smart windows to be manufactured in an electrochemically passive manner, simplifying their installation in existing windows, minimizing up-front costs, and ultimately reducing energy bills. The technology is also uniquely capable of being applied as an aftermarket or retrofit solution. The broader impact of this project will be a potential savings of billions of dollars in energy costs in the United States alone, and a reduction of carbon footprint. Buildings are responsible for seventy percent of the electricity consumed in the United States. As part of a daylighting /natural heating strategy, smart window technologies have received much attention for their ability to reduce building energy consumption. Unfortunately, existing smart window products suffer from severe limitations in lifespan, scalability and cost. The technology to be developed is a radically different approach to smart windows because instead of electrochemical processes, it utilizes stable films. This affords more chemical stability, longer life, better manufacturing scalability, power independence (via manual operation), and lower costs to the consumer.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will commercialize the world?s first cloud-based emotion measurement platform. Today, the majority of market research is expensive and slow, relying either on subjective self-reports or costly, obtrusive lab-based technologies. The proposed emotion measurement platform aims to democratize market research by translating nonverbal facial expressions into intuitive emotional insights. It also drives down research costs and improves market reach through the use of widely available webcams as the means to record faces. This platform enables businesses of any size to capture consumer?s emotional reactions as they engage with their brands, particularly in the areas of advertising, product design and packaging. For example, brand managers, marketers and agencies can optimize ad effectiveness by evaluating viewers&#039; tacit, moment-by-moment emotional response, in real-time over the web, and through the platform?s emotion norms database. The technical objectives of this project focus on implementing automated facial analysis as a scalable cloud-based software-as-a-service platform, building the emotion norms database, and deploying the platform with leading market research partners. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to disrupt longstanding methods in market research by objectively measuring people?s emotional experiences a) unobtrusively b) in real-time, c) at scale, and d) cost-effectively. While this differentiated emotion measurement technology can be leveraged in several target markets, the company?s initial focus is on measuring advertising effectiveness and media research to deliver actionable insights to leading media and market research companies. In addition, the proposed cloud-based emotion measurement platform has the potential to significantly accelerate research in behavioral sciences by enabling the crowd sourcing of huge corpuses of naturalistic and spontaneous responses to a wide range of interactions and experiences from online learning to social gaming. It also allows entirely new research questions to be asked, and tackled with ecologically valid data, such as whether individuals on the autism spectrum respond differently to content. Thus, in line with the origins of this technology, our product accelerates psychological and clinical research on social-emotional intelligence. The long-term vision for this software as a service platform is to ?emotion-enable? the Internet, giving consumers and organizations the ability to add emotion context to all online interactions.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase 2 project targets the realization of a cost-effective solution for achieving increased data throughputs in the crosstalk-constrained copper-medium-based cellular and access backhaul networks, to address the growing demand for capacity experienced in them. Existing equipment, confined to the use of twisted-pairs due to the unavailability of fiber in most locations, often avoids the use of spectrally efficient VDSL, whose high-capacity comes at a cost of vulnerability to interference. The technology developed in Phase 1 of this project, and its implementation in hardware and software as part of the Phase 2 project, will effectively address this vulnerability of VDSL and recover most of its potential capacity through crosstalk cancellation. The company?s key innovation is in non-iterative, low-latency, reduced-complexity, dynamic interference cancellation algorithms, which greatly enhance performance while requiring less than 10% of silicon-area increase in existing VDSL2 multi-channel solutions. The project will involve both research and development aspects, as well as system implementation challenges associated with the minimization of complexity and power consumption. Based on the Phase 1 project?s successful validation of the technology?s critically needed throughput enhancements and its commercial potential, it is anticipated that this technology will be widely incorporated in copper-based equipment. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is in extending the useful life of the existing in-ground copper infrastructure, thus allowing equipment providers to continue to focus their resources on delivering ever-increasing bandwidths, while also offsetting the high expense of new fiber deployment. Benefits are also realized through the company?s partnerships with universities, where the company works closely with key faculty and with students, provides seminars, and has an ongoing internship program that results in the full-time hiring of graduates. According to publicly available reports, mobile data traffic in North America is expected to increase by a factor of over 20 by the year 2015. This massive increase in data consumption, brought on primarily by the rapid adoption of smart-phones and bandwidth-intensive applications, is already placing an enormous burden on the backhaul infrastructure, which carries telecommunications for cellular, internet and landline voice traffic. Resolution of the bandwidth congestion requires significant improvement in telecom infrastructure including backhaul and access, both of which are largely copper-based in North America. The company?s interference-mitigation technology will address this problem in a cost-effective manner by allowing the growing demand for bandwidth to be satisfied with the existing infrastructure.",

Neptune represents a significant technological innovation in infrastructure information management; it will be a domain trend setter by delivering critical infrastructure information through one intuitive, powerful, comprehensive and affordable product. Current utilities software systems are complex standalone systems, typically used by technical experts. Information retrieval from these systems requires significant resources and technical expertise that are not available for most utilities. This project will design, develop, test and deploy production-ready Neptune product that will provide instantaneous access to infrastructure information through Google Maps-like interface to a broad range of users from field staff to executive management. Neptune will remove the technology barriers of entry, enhance the capture and retrieval of enterprise knowledgebase, and help extend the useful life of our infrastructure. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project lies in the urgent need for utilities and public works agencies that protect public health and safety to efficiently manage their aging infrastructure with budget shortages. Our nation?s infrastructure deficiencies threaten public safety and welfare as well as our economic growth and competitiveness. The EPA estimates over 240,000 water main breaks and 170,000 sewer main breaks annually in the United States. Estimates for fixing our infrastructure run into hundreds of billions of dollars. To prioritize infrastructure maintenance, utilities must analyze diverse datasets including hydraulic models, GIS, SCADA, maintenance, emergency response and project documents. Available software are complex and expensive and presents a huge barrier to entry for most small and medium utilities. This is putting their residents and environment at increased risk. Through its simple interface and SaaS delivery model, Neptune will be accessible and affordable to all infrastructure agencies. It will communicate the importance of infrastructure investment to elected officials and public.

Current spectrometer technology, based on diffraction gratings, has pushed the limits of current manufacturing in terms of miniaturization, and has already benefited from economies of scale. In contrast, the photonic crystal spectrometer does not use diffractive grating optics, allowing significantly decreased size and cost. The photonic crystal spectrometer is a compact spectral sensing solution suitable for applications where grating spectrometers are too bulky or expensive and dye filter arrays do not offer the needed performance. In this project, the photonic crystal spectrometer module developed in Phase I will be further developed and customized for visible and UV applications. Low-resolution implementations targeting molecular absorption/emission applications will use extensions of the technology developed in Phase I. In addition, a new technology will be developed for high-resolution implementations targeting atomic absorption/emission. The anticipated results of this project are customizable spectrometer modules suitable for applications in water, biological, and chemical analysis, as well as other applications where a moderate number of spectral signals are indicative of state. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes the expansion of low-cost spectroscopic techniques to applications which have previously been infeasible due to limitations in range or resolution of commercially available technologies. The commercial potential includes new handheld and portable instruments for chemical, photometric, and biological sensing. Photonic crystal spectrometers can be integrated into compact form factors that enable in situ measurement for manufacturing process analysis and in-process feedback control. Applications include solid-state lighting characterization and testing, emissions control, portable sensing, and personal health care. The electrochemical pH and oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) measurement market, a proxy for the pH sensing market addressed by this technology, was valued at $112 million in 2006.

In Phase I, the measurement requirements were analyzed and used to develop a numerical model of the performance of a prototype system. In addition, an eye safety analysis was conducted and a conceptual design of the ALV prototype was developed. Studies were conducted with a breadboard in order to demonstrate improvements in spatial and temporal resolution of the system and to obtain more data to further refine the system requirement and algorithm. In Phase II, the ALV design will be finalized and a high power, narrow-pulse laser design that we have developed for another application will be adapted and optimized for this application.

With the impending induction of the JSF/F-35B into the US Navy in the near-future, concerns regarding noise emissions have taken added prominence. Unique to the JSF/F-35B is the requirement for it to operate in short takeoff and vertical landing mode on smaller ships, with the exhaust nozzle being vectored vertically downwards to produce lift. Jet impingement on the deck gives rise to resonant tones that are produced by a powerful acoustic feedback loop formed between the ground plane and trailing edge of the exhaust nozzle via the ambient medium. Similar noise issues also exist with regards to exhaust impingement on the jet blast deflector (JBD) on carriers. CRAFT Tech and Purdue University are implementing an innovative high-fidelity LES method for characterization of the noise sources associated with high-speed impinging jets. The farfield noise emissions are obtained with an integral technique that has been extended for jet impingement, including the effects of noise scattering from surfaces.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION  provided by applicant   andquot ClotFoam R andquot   is a novel adhesive sealant composition and second generation hemostatic agent  This biological agent was designed to arrest moderate to severe blood loss arising from intracavitary traumatic injury or intraoperative hemorrhage without compression  stitches or staples  Control of Intraoperative hemorrhage in laparoscopic surgery which is increasingly becoming a suitable alternative to open surgery can be extremely difficult  and often results in conversion to open laparotomy  Intraoperative hemorrhage during liver resection and other laparoscopic procedures remain a major risk which affects both immediate and long term results  There is no available non compressible product to control hemorrhage in cases of high volume intraoperative bleeding in laparoscopic procedures  Therefore  a non  compressible hemostatic control in laparoscopic surgery will result in reduction of blood loss  postoperative pain  hospital stay and complications following these procedures   Also  there are no available hemostatic products for use in trauma outside the operating room  Hemorrhage  resulting from traumatic injuries  is a major cause of death in accidents  and the primary cause of death on the battlefield  Over     of the trauma cases admitted at hospitals in the United States is due to road traffic accidents  Hemorrhage is the primary cause of death on the battlefield in conventional warfare  The vast majority of these deaths occur before the injured can be transported to a treatment facility  Tissue adhesives and sealants have been developed to control bleeding  but  since all existing haemostatic agents for abdominal intracavitary bleeding are designed to be used in the operating room  not in an emergency at the site of accident or in the battlefield hemorrhage is often fatal  With early and effective hemorrhage control  more lives can be saved than by any other measure   Proof of concept studies supported by the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute and by the Department of Defense  DARPA and the U S  Army  in the swine model  have established the remarkable sealing properties of the agent  ClotFoam employs a new technology that bypasses the traditional mixture in situ of thrombin and fibrinogen  which translates in greater clotting efficacy and safety  The agentandapos s competitive advantages over available technologies include a wide range of applications and uniqueness for use in cases of high volume bleeding  and its rapid effect  ClotFoam R  is also a plasmin depleted aprotinin and thrombin free fibrin sealant presenting no risk of autoimmune reaction to blood products  ClotFoamandapos s fibrin components can be stored in a refrigerator at   C ready to use  There is no need to unfreeze  mix or dissolve the components  Unlike other fibrin sealants  it does not present a risk of thrombin self cleavage and fibrinogen proteolytic degradation  which can severely reduce the efficacy of the agent over time  Its production costs are much lower than available fibrin sealants   GLP preclinical studies by the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute have compared the hemostastic effect of ClotFoam against GelFoam  Pfizer   without compression or sutures in three surgical protocols producing moderated to severe venous and arterial bleeding  The study has established the efficacy and safety of the agent  and produced the necessary data to submit an Investigational New Drug Application  IND  to the Food and Drug Administration  toward the conduction of clinical trials   The goal of this project is to conduct clinical trials with the non compressible hemostatic agent ClotFoam R  as required by the Food and Drug Administration  FDA   for advancing the development of the sealant toward Biologic License as a general hemostatic  The research strategy to obtain approval for ClotFoam R  as a general non compressible hemostatic agent is to establish efficacy and safety in three distinct protocols that cover different body organs and tissues as well as applications  These protocols include  laparoscopic partial nephrectomy  laparoscopic liver resection and post traumatic  hemodynamically stable and non coagulopathic   spleen laceration  Significance  The proposed technology will significantly improve the treatment of civilian and military trauma injuries related to peritoneal hemorrhage  allow safe evacuation of the injured to definitive care centers  and reduce casualties of combat  It will allow for expanding the use of minimally invasive surgical procedures and provide a method to stop bleeding in laparoscopic surgery  ClotFoam R  could have an important impact in emergency medicine  trauma and surgery  as well as a substantial share of the $     billion a year U S  projected market for second generation surgical sealants  The core fibrin component technology developed by our company could be used by other surgical sealant and wound healing products manufacturers  considerably expanding the option for the treatment of blood loss and wound healing  Substantial economic activity will be generated from the global provision of this core component ClotFoam R  is a novel adhesive sealant composition designed to stop moderate to severe blood loss arising from traumatic injury or intraoperative hemorrhage without need of compression  Achieving hemostasis as primary treatment without need of compression is essential for treating traumatic wounds  and facilitates the use of laparoscopic procedures  The control of hemorrhage in laparoscopic surgery which is increasingly becoming a suitable alternative to open surgery can be extremely difficult  and it often results in conversion to open surgery  This technology addresses important unmet needs  as there are no available products to control hemorrhage in cases of high volume intraoperative bleeding without the use of compression  A non compressible hemostatic control in laparoscopic surgery will result in the reduction of blood loss  postoperative pain  hospital stay and complications following these procedures  Nor are there available such hemostatic products for use in trauma outside the operating room  Hemorrhage  resulting from traumatic injuries  is a major cause of death in accidents  and the primary cause of death on the battlefield  Over     of the trauma cases admitted at hospitals in the United States is due to road traffic accidents  The vast majority of these deaths occur before the injured could be transported to a treatment facility  Various types of tissue adhesives and sealants have been developed to control bleeding  but none of approved sealants are designed to be used as primary treatment without need of sutures or stitches  or in cases of moderate to severe bleeding  All existing haemostatic agents for abdominal intracavitary hemorrhage have been developed for minor bleeding in the operating room not in an emergency at the site of accident or in the battlefield  where hemorrhage is often fatal  With early and effective hemorrhage control  more lives can be saved than by any other measure  The agent ClotFoam has remarkable sealing properties  and competitive advantages over available technologies  Unlike other fibrin sealants  it is effective as a primary treatment and reduces the use of sutures saving time  and facilitating minimally invasive surgical procedures  The agent does not present a risk of immunological reactions  it is safe and its production costs are lower  The goal of the project is to conduct clinical trials with\nthe novel hemostatic agent  ClotFoam  as required by the Food and Drug Administration  FDA  for advancing the development of ClotFoam

        "abstract": "The primary goal of this project is to develop a set of design tools for the development of next generation power and load management strategies and devices to integrate distributed generation and load management into modern vehicle power systems. It is intended to facilitate design and operation of power systems with distributed resources, integrating multiple generation alternatives, accommodating all operational modes and load demands and even component failures. The proposed power management systems will enable efficient, optimal and fault tolerant operation with appropriate cost-benefit tradeoffs and provide a secure information gateway to enable flexibility and adaptability to changing operational needs. We also propose to consider new distribution system topologies and new protection/isolation strategies to enhance overall stability and reliability The proposed effort is based on a new analysis and design technology that enables inclusion of both discrete and dynamical components (allowing incorporation of widely ranging time scales in modern Shipboard Power Systems) which enables the design of controllers that respond to discrete events such as operational mode change, load level of a component/subsystem or availability of generation resource, while respecting the inherent dynamic constraints of the system. The methodology and computer tools we propose will not only enable the design of new distribution system topologies and strategies for the system operators but also controllers capable of autonomous action if the time scale of the situation requires it. These basic ideas and some of the associated computational tools have been previously developed by Techno-Sciences, Inc. under contracts and grants from ONR, DOE, NAVSEA and NASA. In the Phase I effort we have developed a concept of operation, developed an optimization scenario and demonstrated the results on a developed benchmark simulation of the DDG 51 architecture with a Hybrid Electric Drive to demonstrate how the tools will be used in a prototype form. All pertinent component models were created and implemented in the proposed framework. We have also created the operational interface and data-logging tools to achieve a first level of validation. In the Phase I option effort, we can achieve limited hardware in the loop testing and In Phase II, we expect to expand the design tools for such a class of systems. We will also transition the tools to first level of verification to low power hardware in the loop tests and begin the transition to a land based test facility for more significant testing by the end of Phase II performance period. The software will be modular and easily extensible to accommodate the requirements of supervision and reconfiguration of such power systems.",

        "abstract": "Future performance goals for ballistic missile defense systems necessitate the development of zero-erosion throat materials for boost and tactical solid rocket motors. Increasing demands imposed by advanced solid propellants used in systems such as throttling divert and attitude control systems (TDACS) require zero-erosion materials for pintles and throats capable of surviving ultrahigh temperature thermal, chemical, and mechanical environments. The use of robust materials with broad operational capability leads to simpler and lower cost designs. Current Aerojet TDACS divert valve pintle designs employ a Novoltex silicon carbide (SiC) composite. As the system is upgraded and higher temperatures, pressures, and burn times are required, a refractory ceramic matrix composite (CMC) with a use temperature well beyond that of SiC will be needed. In previous work for DoD and NASA, Ultramet has fabricated a variety of carbon fiber-reinforced refractory CMC engine and airframe components using a rapid and low-cost melt infiltration process. CMCs based on various combinations of SiC, zirconium carbide, and hafnium carbide have been subjected to ultrahigh temperature testing in liquid and solid propellant combustion environments at NASA Glenn Research Center, the Air Force LHMEL facility, and ATK-GASL with surface temperatures as high as 5200 degrees F. In each case, the material exhibited high structural integrity and virtually no erosion while at a substantially lower density than refractory metals such as tungsten and rhenium. The potential exists to adapt and optimize this technology for fabrication of components used in advanced TDACS under development by Aerojet. In Phase I, Ultramet established the initial feasibility of a melt infiltrated carbon fiber-reinforced zirconium-silicon carbide (Zr Si C) matrix composite for use as a TDACS divert valve pintle that offers substantial use temperature, manufacturing, and cost advantages over conventionally fabricated composites based on SiC. The project combined detailed structural and thermal analysis of the pintle by Materials Research and Design (MR &amp; D), design support and guidance from Aerojet, and advanced composite material development at Ultramet. In Phase II, pintle materials and processing optimization will be expanded, in conjunction with comprehensive thermostructural analysis at MR &amp; D and Aerojet design requirements input. The ultimate Phase II objectives are to demonstrate cost-effective manufacturing of zero-erosion Cf/Zr-Si-C composite divert valve pintles and establish their performance through two stages of hot-fire testing at Aerojet in a 5-inch pressure-controlled end-burning test motor under anticipated SM-3 Block IB and/or Block IIA TDACS operating conditions. Following successful Phase II results, Aerojet intends to rapidly transition to Phase III testing of full-scale pintles under the Block IIA program, quickly bringing the technology to TRL 6.",

One practical approach to achieving sufficient mechanical strength is through the use of hydraulics. However, the low energy efficiency of current, conventional approaches to mobile hydraulic power systems poses a significant limitation to the development of strong, dexterous mobile robots. Vecna proposes to solve this issue of efficiency through a system- and component-level analysis of hydraulic systems. In contrast to other approaches which consider either software or hardware designs, this analysis will examine the intersection of intelligent control policies and novel hardware design and configurations to determine their advantages for energy efficiency and recovery. Phase II work will build on Phase I designs and test results in actuator development, valving strategies, and novel compliant control policies.",

Part I of the Base effort will focus on enhancing the algorithms that we explored in Phase I, leading to a complete end-to-end software pipeline that will be evaluated on laboratory test data. Part II of the Base effort will focus on the construction of an economical SmartPhone based prototype, including custom optics, ruggedized housing, and a self-contained power system, with physical elements developed by our partner ICx Technologies. This prototype will be evaluated in the field by our team of biologists led by Dr. Phil Leitner. Our Option effort will focus on the construction of a more traditional military oriented field system based on the TRSS Imager-II platform from our partner Level 3 Communications. At the conclusion of Phase II, the Edwards Air Force Base Environmental Management team will have an animal monitoring capability well beyond any that exists today.  BENEFIT:  The immediate benefit for the DoD is clear  this effort will produce an animal monitoring capability that is able to detect, track and recognize threatened and endangered species at stand-off ranges that do not interfere with the habitat of the target creatures. This valuable tool can be used for proper land management and to ensure compliance with federal and state laws protecting certain species. Beyond this immediate use, several important commercial areas exist. Biologists can utilize this system for large-scale fieldwork  its low price making it attractive to academics with limited budgets. In the broader surveillance space, the ability to classify targets is of much interest to solutions providers, and brings this technology to broad markets far removed from the study of animals.",

Nano-particulates typically have disadvantages in processing as they have a strong propensity to agglomerate and can dramatically increase the viscosity of mixing. The chemical compatibility of the nanoparticle with the other elements of the propellant is important for dispersion however the high surface area of the nanoparticles makes using a surfactant or dispersant prohibitive. For minimum signature propellants based on nitrocellulose and other organic/hydrocarbon fuel and/or binders the solution is to use polymer nanoparticles that share similar structural characteristics with the main components. In the Phase I program, Luna Innovations prepared multifunctional polymer nanoparticles that are readily dispersed in nitrocellulose/nitramine based propellant mixtures and these blends exhibit higher relative burn rates than their unmodified counterparts.

        "abstract": "Radomes are key components of future Air and Missile Defense Radar (AMDR) systems and are aboard almost every surface vessel in the Navy. These structures provide protection for the radar face, but the long-term environmental instability of existing radome materials can interfere with the transmission and reception of radar signals. In particular, changes in temperature, moisture absorption, and incident radiation (RF, UV, IR, etc.) can all induce changes into the radome and thereby decrease the performance of the radar system. The objective of this work is to demonstrate the feasibility of producing radomes using low-cost benzoxazine materials. Benzoxazines exhibit good moisture resistance and thermal stability as compared to the epoxies and vinyl esters currently used in radome construction. The results of this work are expected to provide the Navy with a cost-effective means of improving radome performance, while also extending the operational lifetime of these components.",

While this testing ensures that a piece of equipment is shock resistant and will not pose a danger to other shipboard equipment, it is expensive and requires a one-use expenditure of the device under test. A shock sensitive circuit breaker (SSCB), designed to open when it detects a shock event of a given magnitude, will greatly simplify this testing. It will also have direct applications on board in-service naval vessels as a safety device. The SSCB will be designed to meet military standards for shock, vibration, and environment to ensure its reliable and safe operation. It will fit into existing standard form factors and be compatible with existing standards for shipboard power. The SSCB will also provide facilities to quickly and visually determine its status (on, off, or tripped), reset the breaker, monitor and control the system remotely, and to command the breaker to perform a self-test.",

        "abstract": "Eclipse has a variable transmittance coating to meet the requirement for a single day/night visor for aircrews. The Eclipse Electrochromic Device (EclipseECD) is well suited for light modulation applications. The EclipseECD modulates transmitted light intensity over a broad range (80% to 20% transmission) by changing optical density under an applied electric field (1.5V).  This process is reversed by changing the polarity of the applied field.  This technology has a variety of uses beyond just visors but in all cases a proper sealing method for long term durability and survival is required for any sort of commercialization.  The use of flexible and semi-rigid polymer substrates (such as polycarbonate flight visors) offers numerous advantages in terms of processing and applications.  However, for electro-optical use, the primary limitation is that moisture and/or oxygen rapidly diffuses through these substrate materials, leading to performance degradation and shortened lifetime. Thus, the objective of this follow-on Phase II effort is to tailor the EclipseECD for long term environmental stability.  The advanced packaging system developed during this program shall extend the fully-functional lifetime of the EclipseECDTM by significantly mitigating the effects of harsh environments that exist outside of laboratory conditions.",

The desired end-state for this project will be TRL 7 at AEDC providing test personnel and facility engineers with improved searching and data correlation capability to better identify and discover knowledge about turbine engine propulsion and flight testing (such as its performance assessment) and anomaly detection (within the test article or the test cell or wind tunnel infrastructure). From this data, AEDC and engine/flight stakeholders will be able to make assessments related to specific component behavior within the systems and comparisons of the data with other system tests for which records exist.  BENEFIT:  The expected benefits include increasing AEDC&quot;s ability to provide insightful analysis at all stages of an engine and flight acquisition program thus reducing risk while eliminating waste and unnecessary costs that contribute to the USAF and DoD&quot;s longer-term goal to generate greater efficiencies and capabilities ($100B cost savings in the next 5 years). While TDAAS will first be deployed for engine and flight test data, the capabilities themselves are not system or platform specific.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Ridgetop will develop an innovative Robustness Assessment for Design (RAD) tool for aircraft electrical power systems (EPS) to meet system safety, reliability, maintainability, and energy optimization requirements in each design stage by calculating system-level robustness.   The design employs flow graph models for components at different hierarchies. The measurement of robustness takes into account the topology of the interconnected components, the degradation of the components from aging, and the environmental effects from field reliability data.  In addition, factors associated with the following data are taken into account:  X Real field data  X Empirical data  X Thermal and power data  X System weight and failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA).  The data are measured in multi-level hierarchical systems starting from the component level, and moving to the PWB level, the module level, up to the system level. The models can be connected in series, in parallel, and in combinations of both to conduct extensive Swhat-if analyses that optimize the design for overall system robustness improvement. The result of this SBIR program is a more accurate and modern alternative that maximizes system effectiveness, provides a reduction of energy consumption, and increases system robustness through more accurate estimates than those using conventional mean time between failures (MTBF)-type reliability calculations.    BENEFIT:  The anticipated benefits that Ridgetops technology offers are electrical power systems lifecycle improvement and continue level of performance in environment variations while optimizing energy. The main markets that will benefit from Ridgetops technology are the commercial aircraft, commercial aircraft maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO), and potentially the automotive markets. In the military industry, the markets that will be benefited from this technology are the aerospace and defense and the unmanned aerial vehicles markets. This tool supports the demands for more reliable, robust, and energy optimized designs of electrical power systems.   The competitive advantage of this technology over other electronic design automation (EDA) tools available in the market is its ability to provide more accurate estimates of systems-levels robustness over conventional mean time between failures (MTBF)-types of reliability calculations, which are largely based on parts population methods. Higher reliability, increased robustness for a variety of platforms, and energy efficiencies are the principal benefits that this tool offers.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  In Phase I, Cybernet worked with the Air Force to design and create an automated monitoring system for gathering census data about potentially endangered species to assist with compliance with the Sikes act.  This Animal Detection Module (ADM) features visible and infrared cameras, a relational database for stored still pictures, video, and metadata, and Cybernet&quot;s cutting edge image processing software.  The ADM is capable of detecting the movements of small animals at more than 100 yards distance, discerning their distinguishing features, identifying their species, and recording video footage tagged with appropriate meta-data.  The recorded data can be transferred from the field and analyzed for more information, such as gender, age, and health of the observed animals.  By identifying the number of a particular species seen in a given area, the Air Force can make better land use choices regarding Edwards Air Force Base and its Mojave Desert habitat.  This technology is also of interest to other Federal and State land agencies, such as the Michigan department of Fish and Wildlife, for their state park census needs.  Cybernet proposes to develop the Phase I work into a fieldable unit and proceed to Operational Test and Evaluation at Edwards AFB.    BENEFIT:  Our first planned product is the fieldable, productized version of the Phase II prototype system.  This will be sold as a stand-alone wildlife&quot;camera trap&quot;.  There are 440 military bases in the continental United States, many of which are now de-facto refuges for wildlife.  In addition, the US Department of Transportation requires wildlife surveys before they can plan new road construction.  The US Environmental Protection Agency requires that environmental impact is assessed before any construction takes place on undeveloped land.  This indicates a sizeable market for sensor systems of this kind.  Fort Irwin, California is an Army base that shares the same habitat and regulations as Edwards Air Force Base, so would be a logical choice as a second customer.  There are myriad potential commercial and DoD applications for this technology. Our primary approach will to provide the Air Force with an advanced, robust animal tracking and identification solution, but useful for other applications as well. This will include both the computer vision algorithms that provide position/orientation and identification information, as well as the interface and database integration necessary to implement a useable product.",

        "abstract": "Advances in secure virtualization provide the potential to deliver the benefits of virtualization enjoyed by commercial sector to the security-critical networking domain. While traditional virtualization technologies do not provide a sufficient level of trust to be used in security-critical scenarios, several state-of-the-art secure virtualization solutions have emerged that would support these use cases. The proposed research aims to develop an architecture for secure virtualization that can be applied to secure networking capabilities with the goal of improving the agility of secure networks while simultaneously reducing their space, weight, and power SWaP requirements.  To accomplish these goals, the Virtual Secure Enclave (VSE) capability will be used as a representative use case for which a secure virtualization architecture will be developed. VSE is a newly developed high-value capability that faces challenges due to SWaP resection in potential target platforms. The successful development of a virtualization solution for VSE will both enhance the VSE capability improving its likelihood of its adoption, as well as rationalize the use of secure virtualization in the secure networking domain.  Following the VSE specific analysis, a generalized secure virtualization architecture for secure networking capabilities will be abstracted and additional potential applications will be identified.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to advance the development of the Morphable Payload Support Enabled Through Interface Standardization (MENTIS) technology proven feasible in Phase I. MENTIS provides a standard payload interface (SPI) between a small unmanned aerial systems (SUAS) platform and its payload that meets the USAF need for a scalable, open-architecture SPI. In Phase I, POC designed three MENTIS devices for a large variety of SUAS platforms; one of these designs led to a bus-powered TRL-4 prototype (1 x 1 x 3/4 in.) that was tested to demonstrate capability of correcting for connector mismatch, providing transparent connector pinout remapping and supporting transcoding to overcome signal and data format incompatibilities. In Phase II, POC will finalize the MENTIS design and fabricate the three prototypes defined in Phase I. We will test these devices and perform a flight test of one of them. The Phase II results will be a TRL-6 prototype ready for transition to productization and certification. POC will also initiate the process of instantiating a payload-interface-standards working group. Results to date have already attracted support for Phase II/III commercialization of the MENTIS technology including support from a UAS manufacturer for flight testing of the MENTIS in Phase II.  BENEFIT:  Successful completion of the MENTIS technology will benefit the nation by providing a standard payload interface solution that will directly simplify vexing interface issues that plague avionics, marine, and military applications. Currently, this market niche is filled by custom-fabricated one-off solutions, which adds significant cost and support requirements to the end user. MENTIS will eliminate the need for multiple diverse technologies, and allow the resultant funding savings to be redirected to research and development efforts. The government will benefit from improved technologies, increased tax revenue, savings in military spending, and reduced unemployment rates made possible by newly enabled business ventures. Commercial sectors will benefit from more straightforward and rapid data interfacing capability coupled with reduced developmental costs for end products.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will continue the development and commercialization of spider silk fibers commenced in the Phase I effort. Spider silk is a unique material in nature that is currently inaccessible on a commercial scale. Spider silk and other protein polymers are broadly useful in fields ranging from specialty textiles, to medical devices and advanced composites. The critical limitation in producing artificial spider silk fibers has been the lack of availability of bulk silk material and the knowledge of how to appropriately process the polymer into a product of native quality. This project will continue prior work to deliver scalable quantities of material through microbial production of spider silk protein using a commercially viable cost structure. In addition, this project will examine the key parameters for processing silk polymer into fibers whose properties surpass those of native spider silk. The ability to produce prototype silk fibers from recombinant protein will enable the initial steps towards commercializing spider silk fiber-based products. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is important to the adoption of a job-creating bio-based economy in the United States. The ability to produce protein polymers has bedeviled biological researchers for decades. Many important structural proteins and enticing commercially-useful materials have remained effectively impossible to produce. The advent of cutting-edge techniques in synthetic biology, microfabrication, and materials processing now make the production of protein polymers and the processing of them into beneficial technologies a realistic goal. Potential applications of protein-based polymers include a full range of sophisticated materials that are furthermore &quot;green&quot; and sustainable. Spider silk polymers, due to their mechanical properties, can potentially be used to create the next generation of ballistic fibers in the production of armor for military, law enforcement, and private users. In addition, the ability to produce advanced polymers independent of petroleum sources is a key goal of the emerging bio-based economy. Lastly, many protein polymers (including silk) are biocompatible and biodegradable and thus can form the basis for new classes of medical materials used to replace or re-grow connective tissues with implants or devices.",

The new surface will be specifically designed for reverse phase protein microarrays to enable detection of rare molecules in complex biological mixtures. Discovery and quantification of rare molecules in complex mixtures is essential to improve the understanding of disease mechanism and progression, and responses to treatment regimes. Current surfaces used in these applications have properties that exhibit limited sensitivity of detection due to optical interferences, low protein binding and accumulation of nonspecific interactions. This project will optimize and introduce the application of a new track etched , nitrocellulose composite membrane for protein array applications. Manufacturing processes for the new composite will be developed to generate multiple forms of the composite to allow it to be incorporated into a variety of binding assay formats. This effort will also shed light on important properties for generating ultrasensitive binding surfaces. The result of this project will be an optimized composite membrane with characteristics and manufacturability suited for the most sensitive binding applications, such as reverse phase protein arrays. The platform initially will be optimized for fluorescent detection of rare molecules in complex cell lysates. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be to provide a family of discovery and diagnostic tools that will expand the understanding, detection and treatment of human disease. The current focus in translational medicine for therapies in clinical trials is to identify expression patterns of proteins (biomarkers) in individual patients. These measurements allow the monitoring and understanding of individualized disease progression and responses to treatment. They will provide the data necessary to create targeted, personalized treatment regimens. Protein arrays have found utility over the past decade as research tools that provide multiplexed detection and quantification of protein expression. However, the full potential of these tools as diagnostic platforms that provide patient-specific information and guide drug treatment has not been realized due to insufficient binding capacity, limited dynamic range and poor sensitivity. This project defines a new composite surface that has a significant increase in both binding capacity and sensitivity when incorporated into multiplexed immunoassay systems. The composite can be included in a variety of platforms to enhance discovery and quantification of important markers on an individual scale as well as high throughput systems for broad diagnostic application.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop technologies to enable commercialization of nanoscale Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA). Conventional DMA works by applying an oscillating stress to a sample and measuring the time-dependent strain. Analysis of DMA data gives information about material stiffness, viscosity, thermal transitions and activation energies, for example. DMA is a critical and widely used tool to measure the viscoelastic properties of bulk materials, but it suffers from three key limitations: slow speed, limited frequency range, and the lack of spatially-resolved information. Large and growing material classes employ nanoscale composite structures to achieve desired material properties. No current tool can rapidly examine the temperature-dependent viscoelastic response of these materials on the scales they are being engineered. To address this unmet need, we will extend successful Phase I research to develop instrumentation based on atomic force microscopy (AFM) using rapidly heatable AFM cantilever probes. Specifically, the nanoscale DMA platform will provide: (1) variable temperature DMA in seconds; (2) measurement frequencies three orders of magnitude higher than conventional DMA; (3) spatial resolution down to&lt;100 nm; and (4) sensitive and spatially-resolved measurements of glass transitions on wide range of commercially important polymers not previously measurable. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will stretch across multiple industries and academic research areas. Metrology and characterization are foundations of successful materials science and materials manufacturing. The lack of materials characterization tools at the nanoscale has been identified by the chemical industry as a key bottleneck for the rapid development of new materials. This proposal aims to fill a major gap in required instrumentation. With the ability to measure temperature-dependent viscoelastic properties at the nanoscale, materials scientists and engineers will be able for the first time to directly investigate local material stiffness, energy absorption, and damping in heterogeneous materials over a wide range of operating temperatures and frequencies. In addition to spatially resolved measurements, the dramatic measurement speed improvements (a thousand-fold improvement over conventional DMA) will enable higher measurement throughput, lower cost per measurement, more frequent sampling and better measurement statistics. Based on interactions with customers in diverse industries, we have already has already identified strong market pull in areas including epoxies, polymer blends, multilayer films, medical devices, semiconductor packaging, and aerospace markets.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a computer-aided mosaic design and robotic assembly system for automation of a centuries-old manual process. Despite their prominence in art and architecture, mosaics are arduous to design and assemble. Labor-intensive methods have stubbornly resisted automation, adding considerable cost and delay to projects. Artaic&#039;s Phase I research proved feasibility of computer-aided design software to create renderings and digital blueprints of artisanal mosaics by introducing a streamlined, procedural workflow for tile layout that closely mimicked the workflow of mosaic artists, and did so over 10x faster than manual methods. The goal of the Phase II research is to demonstrate the speed, effectiveness, utility, and artistic quality of this mosaic design and robotic assembly system. The key Phase II objectives are to: (1) demonstrate a prototype artisanal mosaic design system and; (2) demonstrate a robotic mosaic production system, that will be: (3) validated for accuracy, speed, and quality through user assessment, and; (4) evaluated for economic and commercial potential. Anticipated technical results will enable a revolutionary advancement from manual to automated processes in mosaic design and production, comparable to the displacement of film by digital camera technology. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project lies in art, design, construction, and architecture. Software and robotic automation will lower the cost of mosaics and increase its traditional societal impact of adorning public, commercial, and residential spaces. Artists, designers, and builders will have a significantly faster method to produce artisanal mosaics without the high cost and time associated with manual design and production. The efficiencies made possible by this proposed computer-aided mosaic design and manufacturing system will enable Artaic to expand into the global multi-billion dollar tile market and develop a domestic workforce to compete against global manufacturers of handcrafted mosaic artwork. Additionally, the computational demands of the rendering algorithms developed during Phase II will give impetus to further development of advanced GPUs and CPUs -- with companies such as Intel, Nvidia, and AMD providing solutions for increasingly more advanced rendering algorithms. Perhaps the most significant societal benefit from the development of this technology is its potential to make artisanal mosaic design and production accessible and affordable to the general public, and because this research enables any Photoshop artist to become a mosaic artist, it also hold significant promise as an educational tool in our nation&#039;s schools.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will continue the development, validation, and full-scale testing of a new patent-pending nanoparticle-reinforced composite product for the repair and rehabilitation of piping and other civil infrastructure systems. The overarching goal of the research is to develop and demonstrate a composite system that can be used to repair pipes without requiring expensive, and sometimes dangerous, cutout and repair of pipe sections, while also meeting Department of Transportation (DOT) requirements to qualify it as a permanent rather than temporary repair. In order to meet these requirements, a composite wrap system is needed with fatigue properties that are much better than current systems. Test results obtained in Phase I demonstrate that the fatigue resistance of our new nanoparticle-reinforced composite repair system outperforms traditional pipeline repair composite materials currently on the market. The specific goals of Phase II will be: 1) validation of initial results from Phase I; 2) extension of property testing to prepare for full-scale testing under American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) PCC-2 requirements; 3) design of a manufacturing machine to produce the new composite product and 4) completion of full-scale testing to prove compliance with DOT regulations. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be to significantly improve the safety and reduce costs for repair of DOT-regulated and industrial pipelines through the development of a high-strength, fatigue- and corrosion-resistant pipe repair system with a design life over 50 years. There were 6,042 &quot;significant incidents&quot; related to pipeline damage from 1988 to 2008, resulting in 427 fatalities, 1,805 injuries and property damage totaling $3.8 billion. Composite repair products currently used to prevent pipeline failures are economical, easy to apply, and can be used to repair other civil infrastructures such as bridge columns and piers. However, current composite repair systems for pipelines qualify only as a temporary repair due to their susceptibility to fatigue, and therefore require eventual replacement via cut-out. Development of a composite wrap system that qualifies as a permanent repair would have a transformational impact on the pipeline industry, placing the commercial potential of this product at $50-100 million, even with a relatively small market share. In addition, with the availability of stronger and less expensive field repairs, pipeline companies are likely to become more proactive with their composite repair programs, resulting in an overall reduction in catastrophic failures and incidents.",

Internet updatable software, executing under a multi-processor, fault tolerant brace operating system, samples the brace&#039;s 40 sensors to monitor leg posture and activate clutch state transitions. Novel brace concepts include soft/flexible tissue interfaces that adapt to brace misalignment, a joint configuration that provides greater range of motion compared with existing braces, and a fitting scheme with potential for self-fitting capability. Three research objectives are planned: optimize the brace design for comfort level while minimizing interference with Activities of Daily Living (ADL); build/test five prototype braces; and conduct human subjects testing with disabled volunteers to assess brace safety and benefits. Primary biomechanical benefits include dynamically adapting to the user&#039;s leg strength to provide full support at all knee angles and reducing the total force across the knee joint by up to an order of magnitude during mobility activities. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project stems from creating a brace that offers biomechanical benefits that substantially surpass those of existing devices without interfering with non-mobile ADL. Anticipated benefits include: allowing Knee Osteoarthritis (KOA) patients to walk with less pain; improving walking/stair-descent safety; adapting to the user&#039;s preferred step-length/walking-speed; reducing the effort needed to walk; and allowing a full day of mobile ADL (including a 20-mile walk) on a single battery charge. This will have a transformative effect on the existing leg brace market (120K offloading braces/yr alone) and improve Quality-of-Life for as much as 40% of the world&#039;s population suffering mobility dysfunction. The benefit for KOA patients includes a new treatment alternative for multicompartmental or obese KOA patients or for patients who cannot have knee replacement surgery. The benefit for walking/stair-descent safety includes potential for reducing the incidence of falls. Falling accounts for two thirds of accidental deaths and is the leading cause of restricted activity days amongst America&#039;s elderly; persons with leg weakness have a four- to fivefold increased risk for falls; directly addressing leg weakness therefore has potential to increase longevity and reduce healthcare spending.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)Phase II project is designed to commercialize a consumer self-serve, automated kiosk for the evaluation, buy back, and collection of used electronics directly from consumers. Prototype kiosks deployed during Phase I provided convincing proof of the feasibility of the baseline technical approach to the visual and electrical inspection technology, robotics, and the market. Financial metrics achieved were many multiples better than industry leading kiosks such as Coinstar or Redbox. Further R &amp; D is required to achieve enough reliability in the automated inspection systems and the kiosk hardware to lead to the permanent removal the kiosk attendants in field that currently serve as the fail-safe mechanism in the current prototype systems. Broad commercial success relies on the development of a robust, designed-for-manufacturability (DFM), designed-for-serviceability (DFS), commercially reliable kiosk with a minimum retail field life of 5 years that incorporates needed improvements learned from Phase I including refinements to the visual inspection system and algorithms, electrical inspection system, test station robotics subsystems, ergonomics, GUI, and channel management systems. ecoATM also hopes to further develop the system?s capability to offer personal data erasure and expand accepted device types to potentially include digital cameras, portable game players, printer cartridges, laptops, eReaders, and tablets. The broader impact of ecoATM?s patented system is that we finally achieved the threshold of consumer convenience and financial incentive required to inspire mass consumer participation in electronics recycling. Our pilot market tests indicate that we harvested 20 times more used phones than the next closest competitor in the test areas. As ecoATM scales nationally we will divert mass amounts of toxic eWaste from our landfills, and put huge sums of cash back in the hands of our customers and the retail locations hosting the kiosks, providing stimulus and incentive for these stakeholders to help forever alter the current wasteful lifecycle of consumer electronics. On average, each ecoATM collects enough eWaste to offset its own annual energy consumption after just 5 days placement resulting in 360 days of CO2 offset. An average ecoATM collects over 7,000 phones per year, which according to the EPA calculator is equivalent to taking the CO2 of 35 houses off the grid for a year. National and global media have taken notice of ecoATM already and even the United Nation?s Low Carbon Leadership Program recognized ecoATM as one of the best ideas in the world for the reduction of CO2 on a global basis.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The ultimate goal of this effort is to improve the performance of the Space Surveillance Network (SSN) including improved space catalog accuracy through more and more complementary tracking, better responsiveness to real-time changes, better tracking of small debris in LEO through efficient use of applicable sensors, efficient tracking of DS frequent revisit objects, handling increased number of objects and new types of sensors, and taking advantage of improved communication and control to globally optimize the SSN schedule.    The next logical step is to develop the full-scale family of SSN schedulers in our current Aurora framework and integrate them with the appropriate SSN systems.  These include the GIG-enabled Tasker Optimizing Scheduler and the scheduling portions of the Next Generation Tasker (NGT), including a LEO frequent revisit optimizing scheduler, a DS frequent revisit optimizing scheduler, and a Global Master Allocator Optimizing Scheduler.  This will require early, frequent, and long-lasting contact with the Next Generation Tasker (NGT) initiative led by the Air Force Space Command (AFSPC/A9A, letter of support from Colonel Visel included) to ensure full understanding of the requirements, constraints, opportunities, and integration issues.  We also will provide advice and support to the NGT initiative from a resource optimization and scheduling perspective.      BENEFIT:  The most direct target for the results of this effort is, of course, the SSN itself including both the Next Generation Tasker (NGT) and the GIG-Enabled Tasker.  Attached is a letter of support from Colonel Visel which says, in part,&quot;Our interactions have convinced us that there are several areas in our NGT effort that could benefit from Stottler Henke&quot;s expertise.  Specifically, we see applicability for their Aurora tool to solve constrained scheduling problems in both frequent-revisit and catalog-maintenance sensor tasking.&quot;By both demonstrating significantly improved performance during Phase II and ensuring that the ultimate results can be integrated into the operational scheduling systems, the Air Force will have a strong incentive to operationalize the Phase II development of the proposed Schedulers.  Beyond the Air Force there are several commercialization possibilities available in the government and private sector.  The algorithms developed here could be marketed to our existing Army and Navy sensor customers interested in sensor scheduling and coordination.  Finally, there are the commercial applications for the technology developed for the Scheduler.  We are already marketing Aurora, our general intelligent planning and scheduling framework, and customizing it for a variety of domains.  The additional capabilities developed for SSN scheduling can be synergistically marketed to the same clients.  For example, the bottleneck avoidance algorithm proposed to be fully developed here would be applicable to many Aurora customers.  We anticipate that this effort will result in additional scheduling algorithms that we will be able to incorporate into our existing scheduling products, thus increasing the benefits they provide and their value.",

In Phase 2.5, Mainstream will work to integrate the TMS with other laser subsystems and perform multiple rounds of thermal and environmental testing.

Working with the AFRL program office, in Phase I, Voxtel has developed a novel ROIC architecture that simultaneously provides the system with standard video imaging data, temporally resolved pixel flagging, and high dynamic range temporal profiling of high energy events within the field-of view. The ability of the HEET-ROIC design to perform temporally resolved flagging of high energy events, using in-pixel discrimination, enables the system to identify and set a region-of-interest around the pixel of interest within several microseconds of the rising edge of the event This fast response time, coupled with the fast temporal sampling of the ROI window (&gt;15 kHz), allows for proper system identification of the high energy threat with minimal system processing time. The Phase II work plan includes the design, fabrication, and electrical evaluation of the full-format (640 x 512) HEET-ROIC design. Following electrical evaluation, the HEET-ROIC will be optically demonstrated through hybridization to a compatible infrared detector array.  BENEFIT:  The transient event capability added to the staring, imaging mode of an ROIC has widespread application. Applications including threat warning systems for fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft. Other applications include active (ladar)/passive imaging, tracking, surveillance, and charged particle detection. Other applications include medical sensors and vertex detectors for use in high-energy physics.",

Once developed and thoroughly validated, the methodology would be used in cost effective development of CMC components by the Air Force and its major aerospace engine suppliers.  The proposed methodology is based on a mechanistic (physics-based) model that includes direct consideration of defect and damage mechanisms, and environmental degradation relevant to CMCs.  In Phase I the feasibility of using methodology to model effect of defects and to do life prediction of CMC materials has been demonstrated by comparison with limited amount of experimental data.  The proposed Phase II effort aims to extend the applicability of the model to a variety of conditions relevant to aircraft operating conditions.  The resulting enhancements will be experimentally validated and demonstrated.  BENEFIT:  Due to the proliferation in potential applications of ceramic matrix composites in military and commercial aerospace engines and in industrial gas turbine industries, the proposed dual-use high technology product has an immediate and expanding market. One benefit of the proposed product is in improving the process of evaluation of as-manufactured CMC parts to sufficiently meet desired structural life.

The first task focused on finding methods for extracting the Discrete Event Set (DES) from sensor data. The DES approach is unique. It works on different types and sizes of diesel engines with little or no modification because it relies on the exact sequence of events that must occur for any diesel engine to run. The DES is extracted from sensor data using discrete wavelet transforms, and is compared to a baseline model of the four cycle diesel engine.   The second task involved evaluating traditional sending unit data from instrument panel gauge. This type of evaluation provides additional details which the operator cannot see, even if they were to monitor the gauge continually. Successfully completing these two tasks has addressed any technical uncertainty about our approach to the challenging problem of automating the evaluation of diesel engine generator conditions.",

Such receivers are needed to enhance the capability of small platforms such as missile interceptors and unmanned aerial systems (UAS). In downward-looking surveillance and targeting applications, high resolution 3D data can penetrate obscuring camouflage and ground cover to acquire and identify hidden targets. The reduced pixel dead time of the linear mode APD, relative to Geiger APD arrays, greatly improves the penetration of obscurants through obscurants, including canopies, and enables sensors to resolve objects closely spaced in range. The capacity of linear-mode APDs to measure signal amplitude also provides an additional dimension of target information to support image processing and analysis.   After a detector optimization process, aimed at reducing dark counts and enhancing responsivity, a high gain, low excess noise APD array will be hybridized to a custom LADAR readout integrated circuit. The focal plane array will be tested and characterized, and integrated with LADAR receiver electronics.  BENEFIT:  The single-photon-sensitive APD technology is ideal for applications where laser power is limited and high-resolution 3D imaging is needed for enhanced situational awareness or navigation.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Innovative research and development leading to a dual-use advanced technology product is proposed.  The product is a methodology and associated software for a damage-based non-linear deformation model to study the effect of manufacturing defects and service-induced damage in Ceramic Matrix Composites (CMCs).  Once developed, the model would be used in conjunction with non-destructive evaluation (NDE) methods to predict the effect of defects and damage on structural properties, component life and residual strength.  The primary focus is on 2D SiC/SiC and S200 CMCs for the gas turbine components.  However the methodology would be applicable to a much broader class of CMCs and components for military and commercial applications.  An innovative mechanistic (physics-based) modeling approach is proposed. The approach includes direct consideration of relevant defect and damage mechanisms. During Phase I models to describe the effect of defects such as matrix porosity and fiber fracture were developed and it was also demonstrated how the quantitative model inputs can be obtained using NDE techniques such as X-ray CT-scan. In Phase II we propose to continue the development and validation of the methodology in order to extend the applicability of the model to a variety of conditions relevant to aircraft operating conditions. NDE and laboratory test data needed to validate the model will be obtained under subcontract with Triton Systems, Inc. Pratt &amp; Whitney.  BENEFIT:  Due to the proliferation in potential applications of ceramic matrix composites in military and commercial aerospace engines and in industrial gas turbine industries, the proposed dual-use high technology product has an immediate and expanding market. In conjunction with NDE techniques the proposed product will benefit these programs by improving the process of evaluation of as-manufactured CMC parts to sufficiently meet desired structural properties and design goals. The proposed product will also be useful in in-service component inspection and evaluation to estimate residual properties. SAI will market the methodology, the software and technical expertise (services) to these and other industries.",

This work will enable easier maintenance and evolution of legacy code bases by also providing the capability to enhance existing legacy code bases with new capabilities written in modern languages that seamlessly interoperate with the existing legacy code.

Currently, the high volume of near-constant incoming intelligence imposes a substantial burden on the analyst to review and digest the raw intelligence causing analyst overload and fatigue, which could lead to missed intelligence. Generalized Ontology Discovery Enabling Semantic Search (GODESS) addresses this urgent need by analyzing the data&quot;s structure and the analyst&quot;s information needs to produce an attributed semantic network extracted from disparate, multi-source document stores containing incomplete, inconsistent and sparse data. At the core of GODESS is the Infinite Relational Model (IRM; Kemp, 2010), a Machine Learning Algorithm that automatically discovers systems of related concepts and entities structured in the data to learn ontologies that are optimal for representing the knowledge encapsulated in the database. GODESS relearns the ontologies as new data sources become available, making the approach tractable for environments with continuous, high-volume information flow. The emergent ontology effectively&quot;connects the dots&quot;for analysts, providing them with a complete picture of ambiguous entities and hidden relationships appearing in the datastore, thereby increasing the relevance of semantic searches performed on the database.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Thin film solar arrays using advanced Inverted Metamorphic solar cells can offer a significant increase in efficiency and specific power over conventional planar solar arrays for future spacecraft.  The flexible low-mass solar cells require an equally flexible robust replacement to the conventional coverglass technology to fully realize both low specific power and deployment flexibility.  This SBIR develops a flexible Conductive CoverGlass Replacement (CCGR) technology that will protect the solar cells from harsh spacecraft environments, while maintaining transparency through End of Life and assuring sufficient conductivity to mitigate ESD effects, so as to ensure that the high efficiency promised by IMM cells can be realized.  The approach uses advanced nanotechnology to enhance the electrical conductivity and environmental robustness of space-qualified silicone materials.  In this program, the properties of metallic nanoparticles will be evaluated and integrated with POSS nanoparticles to form a multi-functional coating that will provide electrical conductivity and resistance to radiation and atomic oxygen.  Methods for integration onto thin film solar cell modules will be developed, and flight-representative test articles will undergo radiation exposure and thermal vacuum qualification tests.  The result will be thin film modules that incorporate CCGR technology that are ready for space qualification testing.  BENEFIT:  The anticipated benefits of the IMM solar cell module with Conductive Coverglass Replacement include much higher specific power, in terms of Watts/kilogram and stowed volume efficiency, in terms of Watts/cubic-meter.  This can enable a high power array that can package into a smaller envelope and be launched on smaller, lower cost launch vehicles.  The research will also increase solar array robustness at reduced cost by providing a contiguous flexible shield instead of individual cover-glasses on the cells.  This technology can also apply to other thin film solar cell technologies, and as a replacement for conductively coated glass in other applications, such as Optical Solar Reflectors for thermal control surfaces.  The nano-structured material may also benefit other applications where enhanced electrical conductivity or selective absorptance may be needed, including structural grounding, thermal transport, and thermal control surfaces.",

The hybrid solution combines mechanical pointing with electrical pointing to support communication links over a full hemisphere while maintaining a very low profile. The proposed work is targeting a SATCOM On The Move antenna design for Ka band, full duplex operations. This solution lowers the active RF module count from many thousands for a comparably performing conventional phased array to 256. The FIRST RF hybrid scan solution provides very low profile (&lt;4 inch height), two-axis fast steering, full hemispherical coverage, very low scan loss, and extremely low RF module count. The proposed Phase II program will fabricate and test a modular piece of the full size system demonstrating the performance benefits.  BENEFIT:  Military aircraft require SATCOM capability to share data as it is collected or to provide secure over the horizon communications. Current solutions are either very expensive phased arrays, two-axis gimbaled reflectors with large drag, or hybrid scan solutions with improved drag but unreliable pointing agility to overcome platform dynamics.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  QuinStar Technology proposes to develop a low noise amplifier (LNA), operating at E-band frequencies (81-86 GHz), with SOA noise performance, enhanced linearity and low power consumption. This will be accomplished by employing a combination of SOA device technology and innovative circuit techniques. The key to the noise performance is the short gate length (35 nm) devices fabricated with InP HEMT semiconductor materials. For this technology, we propose to team with the industry leader, Northrop Grumman. Based on their models, simulations indicate MMIC noise figures of 1.1 dB at E-band frequencies. To enhance the amplifier linearity and reduce its power consumption, we are proposing two circuit innovations: a cascode circuit configuration to improve the amplifier linearity, and biasing the amplifier stages in series (current reuse) to reduce power consumption. Neither of these techniques has been attempted before at these millimeter-wave frequencies. Simulations indicate that we can simultaneously improve the amplifier linearity while reducing the power consumption. In fact, simulations indicate that we can reduce IM products by 30-40 dB, resulting in an OIP3 of 27 dBm with a power consumption of only 16 mW. Finally, this amplifier will be packaged using QuinStar&quot;s SOA low-loss E/W-band waveguide packaging technology.  BENEFIT:  Future MILSATCOM terminals require low noise, linear amplifiers for space based receivers operating at non-traditional millimeter-wave frequencies such as E-band (81-86 GHz). Linearity (high OIP3) is required in order handle advanced spectrally efficient modulation schemes such as 16-QAM, and low power is required both for power consumption reasons and to reduce self-heating. In addition to space-based SATCOM applications, this ultra low-noise technology is expected to find applications in other space applications including broadband RF cross-link communications in constellations, as well as airborne including very high altitude long duration reconnaissance UAVand terrestrial applications. Specific examples include the Joint Arial Layered Network (JALN), the ICD effort from STRATCOM and AISR. Further, this low noise MMIC technology can be readily applied to other military missions at adjacent frequencies such as V/W-band. QuinStar is currently producing the transceiver for the AARGM missile program, and this low-noise technology, if successful, will be applied to the AARGM missile receiver, thereby improving its performance and reducing its cost.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project builds upon earlier work to develop an information security ratings service. When businesses connect their networks with partners or share data with them, they are often poorly informed about the potential risks they assume. Businesses have 3rd party relationships for a variety of operational reasons and these partnerships almost always involve sharing sensitive and confidential data. Data shared can be customer information, intellectual property, social security numbers etc. Businesses are worried about losing data through breaches in partner networks as they face the consequences - financial, legal, and regulatory. Existing risk management techniques are based on annual audits and only provide a snapshot of a partner&#039;s security posture. However, new vulnerabilities are discovered everyday and the industry needs a solution that enables a business to continuously monitor changing risk posture of all its partners and proactively manage assumed risks. The Phase II research objective is to build a scalable fully-automated ratings system. The research will focus on identifying and incorporating new data sources, improving the statistical properties of the ratings model, and making the ratings predictive of future behavior. Historically, credit scoring has been a &quot;cost and time-saving technology&quot; that has provided tremendous value to lenders and borrowers alike by reducing costs, predicting future performance, and improving credit accessibility and affordability. Unlike credit scoring, no industry standard scoring service exists to rate business with respect to their information security risk. With Saperix&#039;s ratings service, businesses and government will have the potential to reap the same time and cost savings that lenders do from credit scoring services. If the research is successful, Saperix&#039;s solution would provide market incentives for improving security outcomes, which would be a significant change in how security investments are viewed by businesses.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Large numbers of intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) sensors spanning a number of different phenomenologies (e.g., radio frequency and optics) are currently employed in support of the global war on terror. While these sensors provide data streams that contain a wealth of valuable information for the warfighter, the growing collection capability is effectively overwhelming intelligence analysts and systems which limits the amount of intelligence that can currently be extracted from existing sensor data. It is likely that opportunities to extract additional intelligence such as high-fidelity enemy movement patterns by fusing or associating data among disparate sensor types are being lost because tools do not exist to fuse the data without significantly increasing operator workload. Thus an opportunity exists to develop new analysis/fusion capabilities that can draw from diverse information sources and associate the data thus creating intelligence from previously unrelated products.  BENEFIT:  The primary commercialization path for the technology developed under the proposed effort is with Department of Defense program offices developing advanced ground station capabilities that exploit data from multiple ISR sensor sources. The new techniques developed under this SBIR will allow operators to focus more of their efforts on the intelligence extraction problem such as monitoring the activities of individuals of interest as opposed to spending their time on tedious tasks such as manual association of data among sensors to identify tracks of interest",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  TRS Technologies, Inc. proposes to develop nonlinear dielectric ceramic capacitors for discharge pulse power application and reduce the production cost of cofired multilayer capacitors.  In the phase I program TRS developed a new antiferroelectric composition showing energy density&gt;4J/cc at a field as low as 200kV/cm and demonstrated that high breakdown strength can be achieved from antiferroelectric and paraelectric ceramic test capacitors.  Paraelectric capacitor with a small electrode area resulted in energy density ~22J/cc indicating high energy density possibly achieved when processing conditions are optimized.  In this Phase II program we propose to reduce the production cost of multilayer ceramic capacitors and to modify the process to find the optimum properties for pulse power application and research on scale up of the process for larger size and high volume prototype multilayer production.  BENEFIT:  The proposed program will enable development of cost efficient high energy density multilayer capacitors with high application voltage and high energy density for use in pulse power application.  Successful development and commercialization of these capacitors will, in turn, enable development of compact, light weight pulsed power supplies for a wide range of applications including military directed energy systems based on aircraft, ships, and ground vehicles.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The Phase II program will further develop the Carbon Nano Material (CNM) technologies developed during Phase I to improve EMI shielding, impact resistance, mechanical properties and embedment of conductors.  The efforts culminate in two full scale test articles.  Because the CNM technologies need to be inserted early in a systems design phase, Aurora proposes to use the Quiet Tactical Unmanned Air System fuselage for the full scale articles.  The first article is a control and built using traditional composite materials and methods and is used as a baseline.  The second article integrates the CNM technologies and is used for testing, comparison to the baseline and technology demonstration.  Both articles will be subject to EMI, electrical resistance and structural testing in order to characterize the actual performance of the CNM technologies as initially tested in Phase I.  Prior to the fabrication of the full scale articles, numerous coupons will be built and tested in order to further characterize the materials and processes.  BENEFIT:  CNM enhanced composites provide increased shielding effectiveness, damage tolerance, mechanical properties and the ability to embed conductors.  These are fundamental challenges/opportunites for most composite aircraft and the developed CNM technologies are applicable to most carbon composite aircraft.  The technology is particularly applicable to UAS due to their size range, sensitivity to weight, and EMI shielding needs.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Two optical methods are proposed for the detection of a range of types of damage on coated and uncoated airfoils in advanced gas turbines by means of borescope inspection of on-wing parts. The techniques are low coherence interferometry imaging of bulk TBC optical properties and luminescence piezo-spectroscopy for imaging of residual stress in the thermally grown oxide layer at the ceramic-alloy interface. The Phase II Work Plan consists of a detailed set of tasks involving design, component testing, construction, and testing of the prototype instrumentation.  BENEFIT:  The proposed instrumentation provides a significant advance over currently employed visual inspection of gas turbine airfoils. For instance, with thermal barrier coatings (TBCs), these techniques allow the detection and quantification of incipient spalls, delamination, and changes in TBC porosity which typically go unnoticed with visual inspection methods. The proposed methods are well suited for use with borescopes and thus provide a large potential to be developed into commercial optical diagnostics instruments for use during maintenance and inspection of on-wing airfoils in advanced gas turbines.",

        "abstract": "Superconducting electronics have the potential to revolutionize digital communications and to improve real-time situational awareness in the battlefield environment, but must operate at cryogenic temperatures. Commercial cryogenic refrigerators are large and inefficient and are unable to meet typical field requirements. Our approach is to develop a tactical hybrid cryocooler that is optimized for operation with cryogenic electronics. The hybrid cryocooler utilizes the Stirling and Brayton refrigeration cycles in an optimum manner that provides high efficiency at all temperature stages. In addition, the expansion work of the refrigeration cycle, which occurs at cryogenic temperatures, is utilized directly to power the cryogenic electronics. This new and innovative feature mitigates the losses associated with (1) transferring the expansion work to ambient temperature where it is typically dissipated, and (2) the parasitic heat loads from the electrical leads that bring power to the cryogenic electronics from ambient temperature. The net result is an extremely efficient system. During the Phase I project, we finalized specifications for the refrigeration system, performed trades to optimize the cycle configuration and operating conditions, designed the mechanical and electrical components, and performed analyses to support our design. During Phase II, we will build and test a critical cryocooler component.",

Ultra-low areal density (0.03 g/cm2) self-assembled TR nanocomposites offer EMI SE double that of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) products and can be repeatedly strained to 50% elongation without loss of shielding. NanoSonic&quot;s nanoparticles are synthesized in-house with proprietary surface chemistry for use in our electrostatic self-assembly (ESA) process that mitigates oxidation and promotes long-term shielding.  Furthermore, our elegant, layer-by-layer, spray ESA process enables the production of uniquely layered structures that offer selective, narrow-band EMI SE and dual-use radiation shielding against gamma rays (137Cs). TR shall be optimized for performance as specified in MIL-STD-464 and representative high power radio frequency (HPRF) environments to increase the current TRL from 4 to 7.  NanoSonic&quot;s CAD models and milled GENEC structure generated during Phase I shall be used to determine the RF energy coupling into the PGM cavity during Phase II.  TR coatings shall be integrated onto representative U.S. PGMs to ensure protection of guidance and control components against HPRF energy threats including high power microwaves and validated by our Phase II defense prime partners to reach TRL 9.  BENEFIT:  NanoSonic&quot;s Rad Hard Thoraeus Rubber shielding materials are being optimized as non-invasive, lightweight, EM hardening materials for aerospace platforms.  Thoraeus Rubber nanocomposites will be primarily transitioned onto U.S. precision guided munitions (PGM) and circuitry to ensure protection of guidance and control components against high power radio frequency (HPRF) energy threats including high power microwaves and as specified in MIL-STD-464.  TR materials would later be developed for commercial applications such as lightweight RF protection for server farms, home computers, and sensitive electronic control systems or System Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems.  Additional military applications for various forms of Metal Rubber nanocomposites include thermal control switches, actuators, lightning strike protection, and RF shielding for large area structures and sensors.

Trident has established a process and methodology, called Safe Test Boundaries (STB) that improves retesting modified baseline systems. The methodology defines a safe test boundary around the modified and impacted cooperating units interacting with the baseline system. Trident is supporting the Navy in its&quot;Open Architecture&quot;initiative which promotes the reuse of design artifacts. In many cases those artifacts are stored in repositories across the Navy. To promote reuse of these artifacts, the Navy is reimplementing the&quot;Software Hardware Asset Reuse Enterprise&quot;(SHARE), which was initially deployed in August of 2006. SHARE is allowing a user of any repository to search the entire set for artifacts that match the requested criteria. When desired artifacts are found they can be retrieved and modified for use in the new system. Modified components, however, need to be retested This project integrates STB into SHARE so that programs reusing assets from SHARE can understand the full LOE when incorporating the asset into their system. By making STB accessible from SHARE, programs will be able to assess the impact of proposed or requisite coding changes.",

These methods cannot directly capture 3D flow effects that influence the aerodynamic characteristics of advanced planforms, complex tip-shapes and low aspect ratio wing/tail surfaces. CFD codes have been coupled to comprehensive codes to provide this capability, but these coupled solutions are too computationally expensive for daily design work.  The Phase I effort demonstrated the potential of lifting surface blade models to partially bridge the gap between lifting line models and full CFD solutions without excessive increase in computation time.  The lifting surface model developed in Phase I was shown to better predict lift, drag and pitching moment than lifting line models near the tip of the blade and where strong blade-vortex interactions occurred.  The proposed Phase II effort would further enhance and accelerate this lifting surface blade model and then provide comprehensive documentation of its effectiveness in modeling fixed and rotating wings in both steady and unsteady flow.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Content Distribution Systems (CDS) achieves significant success in commercial applications by applying a group of replica servers over the Internet to copy and distribute the content from origin servers effectively. To clone the success of CDS for military applications, two critical concerns must be addressed: survivability and security. In this research effort, IAI and its collaborators propose to develop a Survivable and Secure Content Distribution System (SS-CDS) for robust, secure and flexible content distribution over complex and dynamic tactical networks. The major advantages of SS-CDS include: 1) high survivability by minimizing the dependence of central servers; 2) a layered Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) model for content distribution and security services; 3) a security framework that accommodates standard security solutions as well as computational and communicational light-weight security mechanisms; 3) robust handling mechanism to support node dynamics; 4) semantic model for service description situational awareness with respect to the operational environment, mission, and supporting network infrastructure. In Phase I, we have designed the system architecture and performed feasibility studies. In Phase II, we will implement a system prototype and test the system in terms of efficiency, scalability and robustness.  BENEFIT:  We anticipate that by the end of our Phase II effort we will have matured SS-CDS sufficiently and we will be able to demonstrate its functions to evaluate the near real-world use of content distribution. The system is capable of operating over heterogeneous dynamic networks with disconnected, intermittent and limited communications and meets military security requirements. The commercial market of SS-CDS is huge. With enterprise and personal computing platforms becoming more mobile, the demand for survivable and secure content distribution solution is significant. SS-CDS can be used by all companies and organizations interested in secure content distribution over dynamic and mobile networks. Its potential market size is large and its possible customers are innumerable.",

        "abstract": "A fundamental shift in weather forecasting&quot;from a deterministic approach to one that embraces communication of forecast uncertainty&quot;is crucial to advancing the science of weather prediction. The most promising technique today for generating probabilistic forecasts is the combination of ensemble forecasting with statistical post-processing to help quantify weather-related risk. The importance of this capability to the success of U.S. military operations and weather-sensitive businesses cannot be overstated. In particular, using probabilistic forecasts to quantify anticipated weather impacts, in conjunction with techniques for quantifying a users risk tolerance, can yield a powerful decision support tool that substantially enhances the risk analysis process. Toward that end, Impact Computing has teamed with the University of Washingtons Department of Atmospheric Sciences to create an innovative Weather Impact Probability Forecast (WIPCast) solution, building upon the seminal work of Dr. Tony Eckel in the domain of probabilistic forecasting and its practical application. The ultimate objective of the proposed Phase II effort is an operational version of the WIPCast system, building upon our successful Phase I design and prototyping activities. Specific Phase II technical objectives consist of addressing Phase I open issues, addressing key requirements of the operational system, and laying the groundwork for WIPCast productization.",

Given the long life of U.S. systems, alternatives to primary batteries as power supplies for AT systems must be developed. Energy harvesting-based power supplies represent one such alternative.    Energy harvesters (EH), while attractive, tend to have low outputs which create a major challenge in storing generated charge. Quiescent storage environments further challenge energy harvesters. EnerPak, a sophisticated and efficient charge management and storage system, substantially aids in overcoming these challenges. Phase I results demonstrated that a novel vibration harvester (VH) design in conjunction with an improved EnerPak was capable of providing much of the needs of a moderate power AT system.     In Phase II, the vibration harvester design will be refined. Further improvements will be made to the charge management system. Extended VH/EnerPak power and aging lab testing will demonstrate lifetime performance. A prime contractor will provide evaluation of the complete VH/EnerPak/AT system.    TPL is the inventor of EnerPak, holds two patents on the hybrid storage device configuration, and has extensive field testing with EnerPak devices.      BENEFIT:  The developed VH/EnerPak product will make a substantial contribution to achieving long life power needs for AT systems. EH/EnerPak power sources will find numerous military applications in unattended ground sensors and surveillance systems, wireless structural health monitoring systems, extension of battery life, and others. The principal commercial use for energy harvesting-based power supplies such as EnerPak will be in the wireless sensor network market, where the EH power supply market is projected to reach $4B by the end of the decade.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The key innovation of this proposal is the development of a powerful virtualization solution that supports agile mission assurance by facilitating automated management of virtual networks and underlying shared substrate. Our comprehensive solution provides virtual networks with the capability to rapidly adapt to new conditions using information such as link metrics, ongoing traffic flows and incoming traffic constrains.  Our design applies to a wide range of environments, including dynamic mobile wireless environments such as Tactical Edge. More specifically, our flow management mechanisms, such as dynamic performance-aware channel splitting and migration will support selection of links that best suit preference of incoming and currently active flows.  Additional mechanisms such as intelligent virtual router migration facilitate deployment of new virtual routers for purposes of maintenances and horizontal network growth.  Our proposed solution relies on simple yet powerful control applications that leverage our enhanced virtual routing tables containing status information about the underlying substrate. Our flow management applications will use this information to support the dynamic performance-aware and preference-aware management of traffic flows. In concert, these mechanisms will provide a comprehensive management solution that will support secure, reliable, mission-oriented communications over virtual networks including connectivity with the nodes at the tactical edge.  BENEFIT:  Our proposed virtualization techniques address some challenging problems in virtual networks and provide a feasible solution for resource management and allocation in these networks. We expect to produce a mature software tool equipped with the proposed techniques for military, as well as civilian applications. The proposed solution has tremendous application potential for military information systems. The proposed architecture, channel splitting and migration techniques, enhancement of virtual routing table, and virtual router migration technique can be applied to essentially all military networks.  Our proposed techniques in virtual network management can also be applied in a wide range of application scenarios. Essentially, any kind of computer network can potentially benefit from our technology. The size of the market is extremely large and may grow rapidly as the world becomes more and more digitalized and connected. As efficient connectivity and communications becomes more critical, we expect that the aggregate market size will be similar to or larger than that of military networks.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  UV-curable powder coating is an attractive technology which produces a high quality coating with far less environmental impact than conventional coating processes. Powder systems are solvent-free and thus they reduce air pollution emission and reduce waste by eliminating the disposable of leftover wet paint.  UV-curable powder coating combines the benefits of conventional powder coating, with the advantages of the rapid, low temperature radiation curing. Therefore, the Air Force is interested in replacing standard solventborne aeospace coatings with new UV-curable powder coatings for use on DoD aircraft.  However, UV cured coatings generally have a medium to high gloss finish, while the military requires a flat matte finish.  TDA has recently developed a new nanostructured flattening additive that can be used in UV-curable powder coating formulations to reduce gloss. In Phase I TDA formulated these new flattening agents into a UV-curable powder resin.  These flattening agents had good processability and application performance, and were able to reduce the 60degrees gloss from 80 to 5 with excellent film formation (no orange peel).  In Phase II TDA will optimize the UV powder coating formulation, and carry out a full coating evaluation.  The goal of the Phase II is to demonstrate that the new direct-to-metal UV-cure powder coating can meet the performance requirements for use on military aircraft and is ready for commercial production and sales.  BENEFIT:  Flattening agents could be employed in a wide variety of military coating applications. Beyond matte UV-cure powder coatings for aircraft this technology could also be applied to make CARC powder coatings.  Additionally, commercial users may be interested in matte textures for furniture and other decorative materials.",

        "abstract": "Teleoperation of high speed ground robots is very difficult. People use an enormous amount of proprioceptive cues to estimate safe travel speeds and compensate for motion jitter. Simply moving the controls off-board takes away those cues, and makes the task much harder. Worse, the reality of radio links dictates that latency will appear between the time at which a movement is commanded and the time when the video display reflects the resulting vehicle motion. To solve this problem, MIC will apply two complementary techniques to improve the vehicle safety and operator experience of high-speed teleoperation with variable latency. First, we will develop a horse-like semi-autonomy system to change the experience of teleoperating a high speed robot from requiring constant control into something akin to driving a horse and buggy. Second, an enhanced display pre-processing system will synthesize missing images during periods of packet loss or high latency by projecting the vehicles movement and warping the last image to create the missing frame, and stabilize the images to remove high-frequency motion. These processes will be combined into a Supervised Autonomous Mobility Control (SAM-C) software subsystem hosted on a JAUS compliant computing device meeting Army standards for robotic systems.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Mayflower proposes an autoconfiguring router technology, namely the Mission-Oriented Router with Protocol Heterogeneity for Dynamic Airborne Network (MORPH). MORPH is a comprehensive autoconfiguration technology that allows the airborne network to automatically set itself up to facilitate the full networking functionality. This goal is much broader than the traditional view of autoconfiguration that primarily focuses on automatic acquisition of IP addresses. Facilitating fully autoconfigurable AN routers not only involves these traditional IP autoconfiguration concepts but also the autoconfiguration of protocol implementations and other factors that are sensitive to network&quot;s operational environment. There are many challenges to deal with to realize this goal. In Phase I, Mayflower has developed a composite of MORPH technology components that facilitates innovative AN router autoconfiguration, efficient routing protocol discovery, automatic routing protocols selection, and policy-aware routing protocol optimization and reconfiguration. We have also implemented and demonstrated the functional components of aforementioned capabilities in the Mayflower Tactical MANET Test bed (TMT). In the proposed Phase II SBIR program, the Mayflower team will augment and enrich the MORPH technology, test and demonstrate it on the Mayflower Tactical MANET Test bed, and will ensure its commercialization via Air Force field test and demonstration in Phase III and beyond.  BENEFIT:  There is significant interest in autoconfiguration capability in the realm of disaster relief network where multiple parties may operate jointly with network merging and disconnecting during the relief effort. Moreover, the disaster relief first responders from different agencies and countries may use different network access devices with different protocols, and therefore form a heterogeneous network. In addition, there is a growing need for truly autoconfiguring networking capabilities in the home networking area as well as for small enterprise applications. The proposed MORPH system can provide a plug-n-play networking capability for these networks.  The autoconfiguring router technology, MORPH, can enable rapid deployment the airborne networks without the lengthy mission planning. The ability to autoconfigure the airborne networking assets without manual intervention can significantly shorten the network deployment time. Networks can merge and disconnect during the operation without any preplanned complex reconfiguration requirements. The ability to auto-discover, auto-select, auto-configure, auto-tune, and switch the routing topologies (or even switch the routing protocols) based on the communication requirements and current networking conditions with adherence to prevailing policy would represent a key enabler in Network-Centric Warfare.",

Bedford Signals proposes to solve this problem by combining our capabilities in high precision high bandwidth custom DSP hardware with our expertise in digital filtering and calibration. Specifically, we completed a comprehensive study of hardware architectures, FPGA building blocks, filter architectures, filter design algorithms, and calibration/equalization algorithms.

Through both detector characterization and system modeling, we demonstrated the feasibility of using a Compton Camera based on inorganic scintillators as a means to rapidly image high explosives and other organic materials at intermediate to long ranges, when they are impinged upon by a high-flux neutron stream. In particular, we evaluated five different scintillation materials- NaI(Tl), Ba2, LaCl3(Ce), bismuth germanium oxide (BGO), and CsI2, and two different configurations- cylindrical bar detector and pixellated planes. The experiments confirmed the analytical prediction that a compact (less than a cubic foot of detector material) bar-detector comprised of NaI(Tl) is a feasible method of rapidly imaging explosives at intermediate ranges (10s of meters). What remains is to optimize the light propagation characteristics of the crystals (via the boundary reflectors) and to couple the entire system together into a Phase II prototype.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  SSCI proposes to investigate and finalize the design of a SAR imaging approach that provides the SAR user community with good quality complex SAR imagery from phase-history data having temporal and/or frequency data gaps. These data-gap interruptions maybe planned or spontaneous, cooperative or non-cooperative and may result from both friendly and/or hostile radio frequency interference (RFI). We will implement a MATLAB-based algorithm test bed to simulate and optimize the performance of the&quot;gap-filling&quot;approach  the proposed solution will automatically detect and characterize the gapping pattern and will adapt the gap-filling algorithm to the gap pattern, optimizing the image formation process for utilization in various SAR image exploitation modes, including coherent/non-coherent change detection and target recognition by image analysts and/or automatic algorithms. SSCI will evaluate and characterize the effects of the phase-history data gaps on SAR image quality and image utility. Studies will be performed to quantify the quality of complex image features (coherence, mean absolute phase difference (MAD), phase difference standard deviation (PSD), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), etc.) using a statistically significant imagery database; statistics and distributions of image quality features vs. gapping pattern parameters will be obtained from test bed studies. SSCI will demonstrate algorithm performance using previously collected SAR phase-history data; if SAR data containing real data-gaps is unavailable, equivalent data will be formed from real, non-gapped phase-history data and used in the demo. If previously collected SAR data containing real data-gaps is unavailable, SSCI proposes to subcontract with Raytheon Missile Systems of Tucson, AZ to obtain appropriate airborne data for a demonstration using gapped phase-history data.  BENEFIT:  One important advance in the development of modern airborne radar systems is the utilization of active array antennas which allow the radar to accommodate multiple modes for search, track, SAR imaging, etc. Many modes may compete for radar resources, resulting in severe timeline demands due to multi-mode operational requirements. The radar may not be able to dedicate an uninterrupted period of time required for SAR data collection, thus it may be necessary to interrupt the SAR data collection randomly or periodically to perform other radar modes. Such interruptions will leave data-gaps in SAR phase-history data which can significantly degrade the quality of the resulting SAR imagery. SSCI&quot;s approach to SAR image reconstruction from gapped phase-history data will provide the user community with very good quality complex SAR imagery  and the resulting imagery may be utilized for advanced exploitation modes such as SAR change detection (coherent and non-coherent), CFAR target detection, target recognition, interferometric SAR, etc. SSCI&quot;s imaging approach works against temporal and/or frequency gaps, including periodic and randomly located phase-history gapping patterns. The utility of military and civilian SAR imaging radars will be greatly enhanced using SSCI&quot;s&quot;state-of-the-art&quot;image-reconstruction algorithm for mitigating interruptions in SAR phase-history data.",

At the heart of many of these optical sensor systems are mid-wave infrared (MWIR) focal plane arrays (FPA) for their ability to provide high-resolution images regardless of the daylight conditions.  Larger arrays are required to attain higher resolution and expanded capabilities.  However, such dramatic improvements have resulted in lower yields due to manufacturability.       Industry has demonstrated techniques to provide fault tolerance to the FPA, however, improvements can be achieved.  As a direct result, this Phase II plans the integration of fault tolerance technologies into the readout integrated circuit (ROIC) of the FPA to overcome yield difficulties.  Schematic designs of fault tolerant circuit technologies, simulations, and performance verification will be performed. Physical layouts of the verified circuits will be conducted and fabricated using a suitable foundry process, resulting in a ROIC hybridized with a mid-wave infrared detector array.    BENEFIT:  The technology developed under this SBIR would enable the development and fabrication of larger, more capable mid-wave infrared focal plane arrays with intrinsic fault tolerance to overcome manufacturing issues.  It is anticipated that this technology would provide direct benefits to many DoD applications where improved FPAs are needed.  In addition, fault tolerant ROIC technologies would also benefit commercial applications, including general surveillance, topographical surveying, identification, etc.",

First, FIRST RF will enhance the current vest-integrated ground-radio (VIG-R) antenna to realize the instantaneous bandwidth required by the SINCGARS radio to provide full channel hopping capability. During the Phase I effort, FIRST RF demonstrated great success for a wearable VHF antenna solution by optimizing antenna topology and matching networks. In order to fully demonstrate the required instantaneous bandwidth, FIRST RF will implement passive matching techniques and further optimize antenna topology to simplify integration into the Improved Outer Tactical Vest (IOTV). Second, FIRST RF will evaluate the specific absorption rate (SAR) experienced by the user to ensure potential health risks are eliminated. Leveraging past development efforts, FIRST RF has established the professional experience and the tools to accurately determine radiation exposure levels through both simulation and measurement. Lastly, FIRST RF will adapt our expertise for rapid antenna development that was exercised on our FRF-105 product line to fast track the deployment of the VIG-R antenna. Field-ready hardware will be delivered for evaluation and will demonstrate both electrical and integration requirements are satisfied.",

The generator will have a total volume less than 9 cubic meters, total weight less than 300kg, and generate more than 1.5kW at wind velocity of 10 m/s. The design is highly mobile with minimal setup effort because of the wide acceptance angle for wind direction. It is also inconspicuous because of the minimal acoustic and electromagnetic disturbance to the surrounding environment and its ability to be camouflaged. Depending on the available wind resource, the generator will operate in standby or power-generating modes, and it will always have a net-gain in energy (power generated is always greater than consumed). In Phase II, the numerical analysis, design, prototype fabrication, wind-tunnel testing, and field testing will be performed for portable prototypes of the non-rotating wind generator.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  In a Phase I project, the problems with optical performance and low threshold for damage limiting the advancement of mid-infrared (mid-IR) wavelength high power laser systems based on metal-ion doped chalcogenide materials, was addressed through the replacement of multi-layer thin-film coatings with optically functional surface relief microstructures.  Anti-reflection (AR) textures, known as Motheye structures in the literature, were fabricated in ZnSe windows exhibiting reflection losses below 0.2% over a 1500nm wide spectral range in the mid-IR.  AR microstructures (ARMs) were also demonstrated in chromium-ion doped ZnSe (Cr2+:ZnSe) and ClearTran ZnS.  In standardized pulsed laser damage testing at a wavelength of 2.1m, damage thresholds for ARMs treated Cr2+:ZnSe and ZnSe windows were found to be three to seven times higher than the 2J/cm2 often reported for thin-film AR coatings.  Continuous wave (cw) laser damage testing at a wavelength of 1.94m conducted by IPG Photonics indicates that ARMs-treated Cr2+:ZnSe windows can survive power densities up to 0.5 MW/cm2, a level equivalent to untreated material and about 50% higher than the damage threshold of thin-film AR coated Cr2+:ZnSe.   The proposed Phase II project will further quantify the power handling and transmission advantages of ARMs technology in multiple chromium and iron doped material configurations through pulsed and cw laser damage testing and product integration trials in collaboration with IPG Photonics.  A plasma-based etch process developed in the Phase I work that was found to be useful for removing residual sub-surface optical polishing damage, will be further investigated for its effectiveness at enhancing the damage resistance of all components in pulsed mid-IR lasers. Microstructure-based reflectors built in chalcogenide materials will also be designed and prototyped to serve as the high reflector (HR), output coupler (OC), dichroic splitter, and polarizer components needed to form a mid-IR laser.  Multiple microstructure-based laser components will be delivered to AFRL for further evaluation.  Commercialization efforts will include side-by-side comparison testing of microstructure-based components with thin-film coated components integrated within existing and planned laser products offered by IPG Photonics.  BENEFIT:  It is anticipated that a 5X increase in laser power handling capacity combined with enhanced operational lifetime will be achieved through the use of microstructure technology in place of thin-film coatings in solid state laser systems.  In particular, the broad-band performance of ARMs will benefit tunable metal-ion doped ZnSe and ZnS lasers that find a wide range of applications throughout the mid-IR spectral region.  Air Force platforms such as manned and un-manned aircraft requiring more reliable, higher power, wavelength agile mid-IR laser sources include laser communications, countermeasures (CIRCM), target designators, weapons, rangefinders, remote chemical sensors, and infrared scene projectors. Commercial applications include environmental chemical monitoring, industrial welding and cutting systems, and food processing.  Significant advances in medical devices for surgery, noninvasive treatments, breath diagnostics, and imaging await higher power laser sources, as do astronomical instruments for spectroscopy, planetary exploration, earth and solar observations, and optical telecommunications.  Although the proposed effort will immediately benefit metal ion doped ZnSe and ZnS laser materials, the robust nature of ARMs can be extended to any current or emerging laser technology such as quantum cascade lasers, zinc germanium phosphide lasers, and semiconductor microchip lasers, as well as silica and chalcogenide glass optical fiber laser delivery systems.",

In order to mitigate this significant national risk, the Air Force Space Command is leading efforts to improve space situational awareness and early determination of space threats.  To address space operations capability gaps, Modus Operandi&quot;s objective is the development of BackSweep, an innovative, net-centric architecture and prototype tool for automating the retrieval of relevant contextual information related to anomalous space-related events, helping warfighters understand the potential causes and impacts of these events.  BackSweep will use semantic technologies and probabilistic models to formally represent and reason over the environmental, mission and system contexts of space assets. BackSweep&quot;s advanced contextual reasoning capability will significantly reduce an analyst&quot;s workload, enhance his space situational awareness, and improve his threat assessment effectiveness.  BENEFIT:  Benefits of BackSweep include: 1) quick identification and retrieval of information pertaining to anomalous space events for operators and analysts; 2) automated analysis of the potential causes of the anomaly and ranks them by likelihood, allowing the operator/analyst to focus on the most likely causes first; and 3) presentation of the results of the analysis in existing collaborative tools and a more powerful analysis tool that lets the user drill down into the contextual data.  Potential commercialization opportunities exist in other all-source intelligence analysis programs of record, such as the Distributed Common Ground System (DCGS) family of systems, and in the private satellite market.",

The grating topology has been thoroughly characterized, grating efficiency measured and the grating performance -- in an imaging spectrometer -- fully characterized as well.  The performances exceed those of holographic grating in all performance aspects and produce 3X improved efficiency.    Under Phase-II we will manufacture several convex blazed gratings and spectrographs that cover all the common EO/IR spectral bands including UV-VNIR, SWIR, MWIR, and LWIR.  We will demonstrate the performance of the full spectrometers in these ranges; all these sensors will be based on OKSI&quot;s HyperScanVNIRmicro system, which is light weight, small size, developed for UAV type applications.    We will work with several prime contractors that have assessed our work and are now interested in the new capabilities this program offers; this will help transition the technology to commercial use.  We are also working with a manufacturer of CubeSat to develop a low SWaP-C hyperspectral payload for space-borne applications in nano-satellites.  BENEFIT:  As hyperspectral technology is maturing and entering operational service in greater quantities, perfor-mance and cost are still major drivers.  This SBIR demonstrated under P-I, and will produce in P-II proto-type components that significantly improve performance at a drastic cost reduction compared with pres-ently manufacturing technology.    Hyperspectral sensors are being inserted into military operations in theater and we will support such ac-tivities.  In addition, OKSI will revamp its family of HyperScan instruments to cover the full range of EO/IR spectrum.  These instruments are&quot;turn-key&quot;commercial products, and the SBIR will allow us to provide improved capabilities at lower cost.  Finally, we will develop HSI sensors for the growing CubeSat market that provides low cost access to space for both government, and academia.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Coordinate Registration (CR) of OTHR targets requires accurate real-time ionospheric modeling coupled with HF propagation calculations to convert radar-measured target signal delays and beam steers to geographical position.  Our team is the developer of the most sophisticated CR capability currently in existence, CREDO (Coordinate Registration Enhancement by Dynamic Optimization).  CREDO uses OTHR vertical and oblique backscatter soundings to model the ionosphere using Tikhonov Regularization, a constraint that produces the smoothest ionosphere that agrees with all input data to within measurement error.  Recently we extended CREDO to utilize Known Reference Points (OTHR returns from known geographical coordinates, including FAA ground tracks).  When multimode returns from the same target can be identified, an additional strong constraint on the ionospheric model is imposed; skywave propagation must connect all modes to the same geographical location.  In Phase I we incorporated this multimode constraint in CREDO&quot;s optimization algorithm and demonstrate resulting CR accuracy improvement.  In Phase II we will use this improved ionospheric modeling to develop a multimode tracker using NWRA&quot;s SIFTER extension of track-before-detect, with tracking performed in geographical coordinates instead of radar coordinates.  This approach removes the requirement for explicit mode linking, eliminating the longstanding problem of misidentified modes.  BENEFIT:  The incorporation of additional ionospheric data beyond conventional OTHR vertical and oblique backscatter soundings improves the fidelity of real-time ionosphere models, resulting in improved OTHR Coordinate Registration accuracy.  Skywave representation of Known Reference Points such as FAA ground truth targets is one example of such extra ionospherically-related data.  Identification of skywave modes that belong to the same target (called&quot;family members&quot;in ROTHR terminology) allows the incorporation of an additional strong constraint on the derived ionosphere model; skywave propagation in the model must properly co-locate family-member modes geographically.  This was addressed in Phase I.  The Phase II development of a geographic-space tracker eliminates mode-linking errors (the cause of the largest CR errors in OTHR) and provides enhanced sensitivity to low RCS targets (e.g., small boats or cruise missiles), extending the applicability of NGOTHR to important Homeland Security issues.  Improved CR accuracy will enhance the applicability of OTHR as a wide area surveillance asset for Air Force and Homeland Security applications with dramatic cost savings over alternative microwave radar solutions.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The Air Force, other government organizations, and security-critical software development companies could be more cost-effective by using COTS and open-source software in their information and weapons systems. However, these software sources have significant safety and security risks; the software must be carefully assessed and certified prior to use. Due diligence requires even contracted software to be carefully assessed for safety and security risks. We propose to build an assessment process that combines screening tools and existing detailed analysis tools. The result will be a tool-supported assessment process that enables software assessors to prioritize their detailed analysis efforts, that incorporates security policies in the assessment, and that unifies all the artifacts from human and automated reviews. The proposed tools will solve key challenges such as prioritizing assessment efforts, relating coarse screening results to fine-grained risks, creating assessment tools that accurately predict levels of risk, and auditing tools that can usefully summarize results from disparate automated tools. Organizations responsible for assessments will benefit from a more efficient assessment process, an integrated but extensible set of tools for assessments, and higher confidence in the end result.  BENEFIT:  A process and tools for assessing the safety and security aspects of executable binaries is useful for any organization that is concerned about the quality of its software and protecting the information it holds. However, military organizations and companies that supply military software have a particularly strong concern for software security. It is known that hostile actors are targeting high-profile and high-value miltary targets. In addition, safety and correctness of software is also important. Faults in embedded software (e.g. weapons systems) can have grave consequences; even faults in desktop systems can lead to inaccurate information or delayed responses in critical situations.  Commercial companies have corresponding conerns. Security breaches are highly costly and detrimental to a company&#039;s business. Safety errors in code can create major liabilities for the company and risks to human life.  Thus military and commercial companies would benefit from the tools proposed here: unified assessment processes that enable documented, prioritized software assessments of safety and security risks; adherence to stated security policies; and an integrated set of detailed automatic assessment tools.",

We propose to develop a very lightweight, solid hydrogen fuel cartridge based on ammonia borane (AB). Our innovation is a unique packaging and thermal control system that will produce hydrogen on demand through controlled thermal decomposition of AB. This approach can enable solid hydrogen fuel cartridges for individual soldier power systems that meet the Armys challenging goals for hydrogen storage density.

As part of the base effort if resources permit, OPT will perform initial design studies and computational analyses for development of an even smaller capcity X-Pump for potential use the ONR Advanced Desalination FNC demonstrator. Pump design shall be capable of operating under technical guidelines identified in the SBIR Topic N101-082 solicitation, with the exception that the volume occupied by the pumping system (i.e., pump, motor, ancillary components) shall be no larger than 3.5 cu. ft. (threshold), with an objective pumping system volume occupying 2.5 cu. ft. or less.",

        "abstract": "Uniquely identifying an individual based on biometric information can currently be performed by using fingerprints, facial images and eye scans.  These techniques frequently require the cooperation or at a minimum the acknowledgement from an individual that information is being gathered from them.  An urgent need arises for non-cooperative surreptitious biometric collection tools.  Such a biometric that can be collected from a distance (space and time) is an individual&quot;s scent.  For individual identification, one needs to look at the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the scent that reflect the individual&quot;s gene expression.  The Phase I effort established an initial list VOCs that are known to be genetically regulated, established concentration levels to sensed, formulated an algorithm to uniquely identify an individual and demonstrated feasibility that a gas chromatograph coupled with a differential mobility spectrometer (GC/DMS) can provide the needed selectivity and sensitivity in a small, robust and relatively inexpensive package.   The Phase 2 effort will produce algorithm software to uniquely identify an individual based on their genetically controlled VOCs as measured on a GC/DMS tool.  We will design a study to verify and validate these algorithms. We will construct two GC/DMS prototypes demonstrating improved state-of-the-art of IBIS technology.",

        "abstract": "Accurate Automation Corporation proposes an innovative application of virtualization tools to complex information systems, especially the Joint Multi-mission Protection System (JUMPS).  The program includes three parts.  1. A plan will be developed and implemented to facilitate the operation and to manage the growth of the JUMPS. This plan will leverage Virtual Machines (VMs), which abstract applications from the hardware on which they run.  Hardware changes and growth will be achieved with few or no modifications to the VMs and their applications.  Furthermore, VMs will improve application availability and will provide fault tolerance.  2. A new class of application tool will help the JUMPS program address the diverse requirements of a large number of user agencies. Each agency will tailor&quot;minion&quot;apps within the constraints of a common JUMPS software library.  Minions will be delivered to host sites where they&quot;look after&quot;the interests of the agency. Minions address the issue of limited bandwidth by improving peripheral access to central resources.  3. A management tool will optimize system performance while considering potential attacks, thereby improving survivability beyond the level provided by the enterprise virtualization tools.  This management tool is necessary because the U.S. Army faces a substantially greater threat environment than a typical enterprise organization.  The method differs significantly from typical approaches to network optimization because the potential actions of adversaries are considered.  Accurate Automation will virtualize the JUMPS in a way that manages growth, including the diverse requirements of an expanding user-base, thus minimizing programmatic risk, while simultaneously addressing the severe threat environment in which the U.S. Military operates, thus minimizing physical risk. Accurate Automation has demonstrated a solid understanding of the virtualization tools and is technically competent in a wide array of fields related to the application.  Accurate Automation has a good understanding of the JUMPS program and of the related DCGS-A program.",

Hence, the Air Force has identified a need to protect satellite operations centers (SOCs) from cyber attacks for mission assurance.     Architecture Technology Corporation (ATC), as part of its Phase I effort, successfully established the feasibility of an innovative approach called NIRVANA (New Intrusion-Resistant Virtualized Adaptive Network Architecture) that protects enterprise networks from distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks in real-time. During the Phase II effort, ATC will build a prototype version of the NIRVANA computer network defense (CND) appliance and demonstrate its operational effectiveness in meeting the cyber defense needs of DoD satellite operations centers (SOCs) as well as commercial enterprise networks.     BENEFIT:  The NIRVANA network appliance will directly address the cyber defense needs of on-going programs such as the SMC/SCNG Compatible Satellite Command and Control (or Compat) and the ORS Ground Systems Enterprise 2015.  Furthermore, organizations such as NRO and NASA that are consolidating and modernizing their SOCs as well as the FAA that is migrating towards a SOA-based implementation of its air traffic control system would benefit from the NIRVANA appliance. The commercial marketplace for NIRVANA includes enterprises that rely on real-time, high-availability applications such as financial institutions, telecommunications companies, cloud service providers, and e-commerce sites.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  We propose three distinct innovations which are key to achieving a drastic reduction of cost of a block downconverter, while simultaneously improving the overall performance. The use of GaN devices will allow exceptionally high performing MMICs to be developed which will reduce the system noise figure and raise the system linearity. These two effects will greatly increase the dynamic range of the receiver. The use of GaN devices will at present be costly due to the immaturity of the process. Therefore we propose to use a newly emerging technology to utilize the performance of the GaN devices at a fraction of the cost. The development of the IPD process will revolutionize the use of GaN devices in microwave and millimeter wave (MMW) systems. A third innovation will be the demonstration of a new mixer topology which will have exceptional spur performance and allow a drastic reduction in the complexity of the system architecture. This development alone could reduce the overall cost of the block converter by $3,000 to $5,000. We have developed relationships with a major block converter supplier and they have provided us with a letter of intent to assist us with the commercialization of the products derived.  BENEFIT:  We have approached a key manufacturer of block converter products to assist us with the commercialization of these products. Millitech Corporation has been giving us insights into the problems experienced by block converter vendors throughout the phase 1 program. They have become extremely interested in our efforts and are eager to see the proposed products be developed for inclusion into their systems. They have provided CMDS with a letter of intent to work with us and assist us in the commercialization of these systems. It should also be noted that all radio systems are subject to the current limitations of the individual components that are currently available in the market place. The creation of new ultra-linear, low spurious converters will be directly applicable to a number of other markets. We will actively pursue these markets with the new products. These will include point to point radios (for use in cellular backhaul systems), pico-cell systems, and other SATCOM radio systems. The LNA products will also be directly applicable to phased array receiver systems. The ability to eliminate an input limiter will once again be of high interest in these systems. The use of these LNAs will directly impact the system linearity and dynamic range. The IPD process will also allow us to innovate and create solutions that are likely 1/10 of the cost of competing vendors. Such a cost advantage will be a huge benefit to CMDS and will result in deployment of the technology much faster than anticipated if a purely GaN solution is created.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Current cyber network defense strategies often focus on treating all tasks or activities that support military missions as if they were of equal importance, thus requiring the same level of protection to mitigate the effects of potential cyber attacks. Clearly, this is not the case. Mission-supporting activities have different impacts on mission objectives and therefore must be prioritized. There is a need to alter the current defense focus from information assurance and perimeter defense (ensuring the successful transmission of information to the appropriate destinations) to mission assurance (ensuring the attainment of mission objectives). 21CT&quot;s Network Prioritization Analysis Capability (NetPAC) is a holistic approach using system dynamics modeling to represent the activities supporting one or more Air Force missions.  The model consists of key activities and interactions, feedback loops, and delays, all critical factors needed in analyzing mission assurance.    The NetPAC Phase I technical effort resulted in the generation of an early prototype, paving the way for full implementation in Phase II.  The system dynamics approach was shown to be feasible for addressing the Air Force objectives.  In Phase II, we plan to enhance the capabilities of the system dynamics model by considering an entire spectrum of Air Force missions and supporting activities, the cyber services underlying these missions, and the software needed to facilitate data entry, model execution, and collaborative decision-making across military organizations.     BENEFIT:  When fully developed and deployed, NetPAC is expected to give military planners and commanders the ability to analyze missions, mission-supporting activities, and IT assets and services to determine the priorities that must be established to satisfy military objectives.  NetPAC will provide a&quot;what if&quot;capability to support collaborative decision-making about mission and activity prioritization.  The decisions will be at both the planning stage and the execution (real-time) stage of military missions.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Space surveillance is that component of space situational assessment and protection that makes use of multisource data to track and identify space objects.  Given the increasing importance of space, the need to protect space assets, and the increasing number of objects in space, an automated system of tracking and maneuver detection is required to support decision makers.  Such a system must deal with many challenges including a data starved environment, nonlinear and non-conservative forces with uncertain parameters, long propagation times without observations, wide variability in scenario complexity from breakups to widely spaced objects, uncorrelated tracks, and fusion of radar and EO reports.    To address these challenges, Numerica proposes the development of an adaptive multiple hypothesis tracking (MHT) class of algorithms in a software environment that supports rapid algorithm prototyping, testing and evaluation, and object-oriented design.  Such an environment will build on Numerica&quot;s existing MHT for space surveillance by supporting and incorporating different algorithms for association, nonlinear filtering, uncertainty management, complexity reduction, and likelihood ratios, while placing an emphasis on GEO including sensor bias treatments and joint MHT and maneuver detection.  The program will unify these topics under a single framework capable of solving large problems autonomously.  BENEFIT:  The first anticipated benefit from the proposed program will be the development of a modern and statistically robust approach to tracking space objects through the use of modern nonlinear estimation and correlation techniques.  A second anticipated benefit will be the significant advance in change and maneuver detection. The combination ensures a robust system for tracking and maneuver/change detection.    The key commercialization of the proposed program would be a transition of the algorithms and software, either alone or embedded in a modern multiple target tracking system, to the JSpOC Mission System, intelligence customers, or to a prime for the Space Fence such as Lockheed Martin.  This program also provides the opportunity to work with other contractors and the nation&#039;s Air Force labs in support of the nation&#039;s space protection and situational assessment programs utilizing Numerica&#039;s strengths in all phases of multiple target tracking, modern control systems, sensors, sensor resource management, and situation assessment.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  This proposal focuses on the development of a novel video-rate snapshot hyperspectral sensor (VSHS) that can provide large format datacubes at 50 frames per second with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of over 200 in every wavelength band. Its measurement principle is based on Image Mapping Spectrometry (IMS), a technique recently developed at Rice University and exclusively licensed to Rebellion Photonics. As a snapshot method, it contains no moving parts or dynamically adjustable components, and thus can image fast moving targets while guaranteeing a high SNR, compact size, low power consumption, and increased durability. As a non-computational technique, it is not prone to reconstruction artifacts and can deliver data in real time, and as a non-scanning technique, it does not require image post-processing to correct for spectral or spatial misregistration.  BENEFIT:  Our ultimate goal is to provide the VSHS in a highly portable form, e.g. similar to a large SLR camera working in the infrared spectrum with the aim to allow remote detection of various organic compounds. The DOD will have many uses for this product in addition to aerial surveillance and target tracking, some of these applications could include: improvised explosive device (IED) detection, missile target verification, and discovery of camouflaged objects. In addition, the technology can also be applied to many non-military applications. Chemical companies can use the VSHS to detect and quantify chemical leaks from the piping at their plants. Oil companies can use this device for oil exploration and it will also be used in the agriculture industry for improving the quality of their crops.",

        "abstract": "Current gearbox life estimation techniques commonly underplay the significance of gear tooth surface fatigue due to the complexity of the phenomenon involved. The Phase I program successfully demonstrated the feasibility of utilizing advanced modeling techniques to predict the onset and propagation of surface and bending fatigue in spiral bevel gears, including an analysis of mixed-elastohydrodynamic lubrication and damage accumulation in the material. Phase II will build on this success by developing these models into a complete gear life analysis, including a comprehensive graphical user interface for model construction and analysis control. Extensive verification of the models will ensure accuracy of the results. The completed software will provide analysts with a tool to predict the life of helicopter spiral bevel gears.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  A new algorithm, the Daylight Object Restoration Algorithm (DORA), has been developed. DORA includes a novel implementation of the multi-frame blind deconvolution image restoration concept which recovers high-quality object estimates from sequences of degraded images. DORA removes the effects of atmospheric aberration in images recorded at ground-based telescopes, and is designed to operate under seeing conditions much more severe than any previous approach can address. We have demonstrated that DORA restores high quality object estimates in seeing as bad as D/r0=70 (D is the telescope diameter and r0 is the Fried parameter). This is more than three times worse than the seeing at which conventional techniques begin to fail.  We will implement DORA as a parallel code on a supercomputing platform at the MHPCC. We will begin with an integrated version of DORA for a single processor, and continue to the parallel version. Both will be tested with simulated and real data, to include data from the Maui Space Surveillance System. We will develop the parallel code in a manner that will facilitate its deployment on a variety of computing platforms. This will support the range of commercialization targets that have been identified, which will have unique hardware requirements.  BENEFIT:  Benefits to the government are the ability to make high resolution images of satellites from ground-based optical surveillance facilities even in daylight conditions. This dramatically reduces the typical wait time to acquire an observation of a particular satellite since it relieves the requirement to wait for a particular geometrical configuration with respect to the sun. Commercial applications include long-path horizontal imaging; post-processing of astronomical observations recorded with partial adaptive optics correction, thus allowing sharper images at shorter wavelengths; image sharpening in the movie industry.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Friendly aircraft face increasingly sophisticated, networked enemy threats, possibly resulting in detection and Mission failure.  Success depends on EW sensor and communications systems detecting enemy radars and communications before they detect us.  EW sensor systems themselves may suffer UAV losses, jamming, and other interference.  Large traffic bursts from simultaneous detections may lead to congestion, lost detection reports, and detection delay.  SSCI will apply innovative network techniques to provide routing that automatically generates multi-path routes when they are needed and useful, to keep track of more network state information so routes will minimize exposure to enemy interference, and Disruption Tolerant Networking techniques to avoid discards during short outages and increase detection information delivery.  We also provide network organization techniques to optimize detection information delivery to fusion nodes that can combine them to detect enemy emitters and methods for fast detection of congestion or link loss to trigger re-routing.  Our methods are distributed, adaptive, and efficient - providing redundancy when necessary to preserve performance.  Our partner is BBN Technologies, the principle developer of the original ARPANET.  Their expertise in routing and network development, combined with SSCI&#039;s background in mobile DTN networking, data fusion, and EW geolocation methods will ensure successful Phase II algorithm development and Phase III transition.  BENEFIT:  EW Battle Management systems work in hostile environments  with enemy interference, node loss and intermittent communications.  The routing and network organization methods here meet time, reliability, and robustness requirements by providing distributed, adaptive methods to designate alternate sensors and fusion nodes for task completion, to generate alternate routes to get detection information where it is needed, and to control bandwidth expenditures to maximize system potential in all environments. Alternate tasking and routing paths ensure detections when parts of the sensor or communications network is disabled by the enemy; adaptive methods that use resources only when necessary preserve system capacity to detect new enemy threats.  The communications protocols developed here may be included in UAV systems, such as Global Hawk.  EW sensor networks with the features developed in this project may ultimately support the Joint Strike Fighter program. Our methods are applicable to Homeland Defense sensor networks and commercial or personal applications where sensors are vulnerable to suppression or environmental degradation.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Packaging is an increasingly important area for technology advancement in order to obtain lightweight, small volume footprints for airborne and other mobile applications. Most attempts at constructing HELs (High Energy Lasers) based on semiconductor pumped fiber lasers have involved combining many smaller high brightness laser diode pumps and integrating them into a single or multiple fiber amplifier chain. These attempts have resulted in the creation of fiber amplifiers of about the 1kW level that take an entire 19&quot;Rack Cabinet. Clearly fiber amplifiers that have higher power in much more compact packaging are needed. In order to accomplish this, laser diode stacks that are highly improved in reliability, performance and cost are needed as well. Eotron has developed a new laser diode technology that overcomes the challenges associated with high brightness, and simultaneously lowers the manufacturing cost of all components. Eotron has identified specific process steps in the fabrication of silicon components where improvements in process parameters, equipment and/or materials can make a significant impact in reliability, manufacturability and yield over the current method. Additionally, these improvements lower the risk associated with building larger diode bar stacks, significantly advancing technology deployment.  BENEFIT:  TMany government projects can also benefit from the development and deployment of SMC technology. From the energy sector to the defense industry, SMC technology will deliver high brightness, compactness, reliability, and lower cost to many coherent and incoherent-beam-combining (ICBC) projects that use a high power laser. Eotron has identified specific process steps in the fabrication of silicon components where improvements in process parameters, equipment and/or materials can make a significant impact in reliability, manufacturability and yield over the current method.

We will do this by building on work done by Australia&#039;s National Information Communications Technology Research Center (NICTA), which includes a complete code-level formal proof of correctness of the L4.verified microkernel running on the ARM processor. Working with NICTA, we will build a system with the separation properties specified by the Separation Kernel Protection Profile (SKPP), and we will augment the proofs of correctness to include the separation properties. If the Common Criteria defined an EAL 8, this system would meet that level of assurance. To reduce the costs of developing and deploying software on a MILS platform, we will enable R &amp; D customers to defer their deployment hardware/software platform selection until later in the development stage by developing an open source prototyping environment for separation kernel projects. We intend to make the set of tools freely available and open source. This should allow preoperational capabilities to be demonstrated with little-to-no cost beyond developer time. Delaying platform lock-in will create a more cost- and feature-competitive marketplace for hardware and software selection.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Conformal, wideband and low frequency antennas are a persistent source of research and development for military and commercial integrators, particularly airframe integrators. Generally, conformal antennas are either narrow band or inefficient. Low frequency antennas are usually large and not conformal. The intense research in metamaterials for antenna applications over the past decade has been focused on reducing the size and footprint of antennas, allowing for conformal installation of antennas that otherwise would remain as drag inducers on aircraft.  But, if the performance benefits of these materials are to be realized, they need to become lighter and more affordable. Otherwise, they are too heavy and too expensive to fly aboard UAVs.  During Phase I of this program, FIRST RF validated the performance of a lower cost and lighter weight alternative metamaterial for use in the design of a communications antenna and a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) antenna. We have measured data supporting our fundamental claim that there are manufacturable and fieldable conventional metamaterials.  The Phase II program that we propose here will be focused on putting the Phase I research into action by building application specific hardware for both a communications antenna and for an ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance) antenna.  BENEFIT:  The benefits of this technology start with the affect the technology has on conformal antenna operating near a ground plane.  Most low frequency and/or broadband antennas are not able to operate conformally because of the band limited nature of operation in proximity to a ground plane.  Metamaterial research for antenna applications has been very focused on allowing conformal antennas to operate at low frequencies and over broad bandwidths.  But physical embodiments of many metamaterials are very expensive and very heavy.  The proposed technology is a low cost and lightweight alternative to these materials, benefitting conformal antenna and airframe designers, as well as general users of metamaterials for conformal applications.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  All High Energy Laser (HEL) systems require accurate pointing and precise stabilization of the laser beam to be effective. HEL systems hosted on aircraft pose an additional challenge to beam stabilization efforts due to the harsh linear and angular vibration environments inherent in such vehicles.  A key element of the stabilization system is the Optical Inertial Reference Unit (OIRU).  The ATA Tactical Inertial Reference Unit (ATA TIRU) high performance design has a resolution greater than 500 nano-radians.  In addition, the ATA TIRU is designed to minimize the Size Weight and Power (SWaP) of OIRU technology. The innovative mechanical design will fit within a 3&quot;x3&quot;x3&quot;cube and will consume less than 18 W of power in its quiescent state.  Versatility is built into the ATA TIRU design.  This provides the Air Force with a powerful, low SWaP, high performance device that can be the cornerstone for all future directed energy, laser communications, and high resolution imaging systems.  ATA has a legacy of custom research and development solution success. Custom engineered solutions require a deep understanding of engineering design principles and an unwavering desire to meet the customers&quot;needs.  ATA&quot;s is pleased to offer the Air Force the ATA TIRU technology.    BENEFIT:  Current OIRU technologies are too large to be placed on smaller gimbaled telescopes found in the tactical arena.  The ATA TIRU is an enabling technology for the tactical arena, as up until this effort, no OIRU has been designed to meet the Size Weight and Power (SWaP) constraints that this environment levies on an OIRU.  These requirements require a change in the design philosophy in current OIRU technology.  ATA TIRU is our solution to this need.  The ATA TIRU is based on proven ATA Magneto Hydro Dynamic (MHD) Angular Rate Sensor (ARS) technology.   The innovative mechanical design of the ATA TIRU fits within a 3&quot;x3&quot;x3&quot;cube, delivers less than 500nano-radians of jitter onto its optical reference beam, and consumes less than 18 W of power in its quiescent state.  The ATA TIRU advanced design provides an opportunity for ATA to market and receive funding from non-SBIR sources and it gives the Air Force unmatched state of the art OIRU performance for its future HEL weapons development programs.",

Extensive simulations were performed using actual images from LADAR (18 images) and electro-optical images (23 images).

In Phase II, we will extend our algorithm to deal with missing data in hyperspectral images and missing links in social networks. Medium to high missing rates will be considered. The goal is to improve target detection and change detection performance by using hyperspectral images and to recover missing links in social network data. We will also address some theoretical issues in our algorithm such as how to choose the local window size. In addition, it should be noted that matrix completion algorithms are computationally intensive. So in Phase II, we will develop fast processing prototypes by using graphical processor unit (GPU), multi-core CPUs, and DSP. This will provide a number of fast processors for different applications.

These coatings will increase the durability of hot-section engine components to significantly improve the time&quot;on-wing&quot;, safety and readiness of these engines. Currently, TBC top coats are applied onto gas turbine engine components primarily using an electron beam physical vapor deposition (EB-PVD) process. This approach is an effective means for applying high quality TBC coatings, however, a key drawback of the process it that it can only effectively coat surfaces that are in the line-of-sight of the component surface. The advent of advanced engine designs containing complex components with many hidden and partially hidden surfaces have resulted in a growing need for TBC deposition techniques which can effectively deposit high quality coatings onto the non line-of-sight regions of these components.

These 30,000 fasteners are comprised of approximately 350 unique part numbers and each must receive one of three different promoter solutions and sealers, each with time-limited properties.  Preparing the fasteners in a way that does not result in an equal number of daily machine cycles is essential to prevent excessive Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) and Mean Time To Repair (MTTR) issues over the long F-35 program life.  To meet the technical requirements as well as the larger system robustness challenge, VRSI has established a process to prepare the fasteners with over 300 times fewer machine cycles than an individually prepared fastener process.  This also results in less complexity, moving parts, system cost and time to prepare.         The system consists of modular commercial and custom-designed sub-systems integrated into an affordable manufacturing solution to solve the fastener preparation challenge.  These operations are organized, controlled and prompted via an electronic Dynamic Bill of Materials (DBOM) that captures the as-built condition of the aircraft.  The DBOM will be used to drive the daily fastener kitting process as well as organize the manual sealing and installation through the use of optically projected work instructions on the aircraft skin.

Laser weapons and high-power microwave generators are examples where TES can help.  Ammoniated complex compound systems can provide heat absorption due to exothermic dissociation of the complex compound.  Very high energy density and power density TES are possible, and there are no standby losses from a charged system.  Gas released during dissociation can be stored or safely disposed of  Phase I identified two viable options: (1) storing gas in a gas-storage reactor with a lower vapor pressure complex compound, and (2) catalytically combusting the desorbed gas.  TES systems of this type are recharged by allowing ammonia to return to the TES vessel and reform the complex compound.  Thousands of TES recharge cycles are possible.  Heat and mass transfer processes and internal structures developed at Rocky Research ensure high reaction rates and stabilize the solid reactant.  Phase II will focus on reactor optimization followed by demonstration of both of the above two options at a capacity of about 10 kW.  Heat storage from a 25 &amp; #61616;C load from laser diodes will the primary focus of  Phases II efforts.  BENEFIT:  The primary benefit of this project will be to provide the Air Force with viable thermal management for electric lasers, especially those on air craft.  However, high energy density TES can be beneficial anywhere there are transient heat loads.  Besides directed energy weapons and rail guns, possible applications include high-power microwave generators, electronics and computing systems with short-term high loads such as those used in missile guidance and enemy threat tracking.

In the Phase II effort Stratom will produce a prototype platform and will develop the system&quot;s core mobility and autonomous navigation capabilities, as well as the mechanical platform that will accurately represent the final system&quot;s size, shape, and load carrying capabilities while maintaining compatibility with current 463L systems. The integrated prototype will represent a TRL6 solution and will be used to evaluate and demonstrate the system&quot;s mobility, core navigation, and cargo handling capabilities for government and commercial customers. The potential applications of an automated heavy cargo hauling vehicle include weapon transportation on ships and bases, movement of material in automated manufacturing lines and warehouses, and the automated movement of commercial freight containers in shipyards and airports. Specific benefits of the Robo-Pallet system in these application areas include its unique propulsion system, which provides maneuverability not currently available, the pallet&quot;s ability to self-weigh and track cargo, and its ability to operate in unstructured dynamic environments.  BENEFIT:  By introducing a high-level of autonomy into the Air Force air cargo handling operations, the Intelligent Robo-Pallet will provide the Air Force, and other branches, an advanced ability to move cargo in congested, dynamic, environments without the use of additional material handling support equipment, such as k-loaders and forklifts, and human resources. This is a critical capability in the delivery of cargo to forward airbases, or newly deployed bases, that do not have the support equipment and manpower necessary to maneuver and manipulate the standard 463L pallet. Thus, a significant benefit of the Robo-Pallet is to greatly reduce the manpower and support equipment required to handle palletized cargo at resource constrained locations. Additional benefits are an improved ability to track and monitor packages on an individual pallet through RFID technology and the ability of the pallet to self-weigh cargo. The ability of the Robo-Pallet to self-weigh its cargo, and measure the cargo&quot;s center of gravity, will enable a team of pallets to determine a more optimal load configuration for a specific aircraft in terms of placing the total cargo center of gravity as close as possible to the aircraft&quot;s optimal location. Optimizing the aircraft load balance can lead to a reduction of total fuel used on a flight, and when this reduction of fuel usage is taken over a fleet of aircraft using the Robo-Pallet system, a significant cost savings can be potentially realized.    While the Robo-Pallet has a very specific mechanical design to meet 463L cargo handling specifications, the potential commercial applications of an automated heavy cargo hauling vehicle are numerous and include weapon transportation on ships and bases, movement of materials in automated manufacturing lines and warehouses, and the automated movement of commercial freight containers in shipyards and airports. The benefit of the Robo-Pallet system over currently used commercial systems in these application areas are the Robo-Pallet&quot;s unique propulsion system, that provides agility and maneuverability not currently available, the pallet&quot;s variable height capability, the pallet&quot;s ability to self-weigh and track packages or material it is transporting for tamper detection and validation of expected load weight, and its ability to operate in unstructured, dynamic, environments.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Technology to aid in the understanding and exploitation of text has not kept pace with the technology used to generate, record, transmit, and store the data.  This imbalance has led to a situation where Warfighters spend a disproportionate amount of time both finding information they need and finding the audience that needs the information they have.   This problem is particularly pronounced in operational settings that rely on chat for mission coordination and situational awareness.  The CHAt Relevance and Targeting (CHART) project directly addresses this problem through four technical thrusts.  1) The development of a low-overhead data monitoring appliance that can passively capture Warfighter chat activity, 2) The refinement of the text content modeling algorithms developed in Phase I, 3) Creation of a relevance-mapping capability that builds user-specific models of information salience, and 4) the development and evaluation of a user interface designed through a disciplined Goal Directed Task Analysis process.  Through early Participation With Industry (PWI) activities, use of cognitive task analysis during interface development, and integration in ESC&quot;s Delta lab, the CHART project is designed to produce a tested and validated capability by the end of Phase II.  BENEFIT:  In operational environments that rely on chat and other text-based communication formats for mission coordination and execution, users build and maintain Situational Awareness (SA) through reading.  Since a human&quot;s rate of reading is constant, situational awareness degrades as the text-to-time ratio increases.  A rapid operational tempo decreases the time available to find ingest information, increasing the text-to-time ratio and degrading SA.  A large amount of potentially relevant text also increases the text-to-time ratio, damaging SA.    The CHART system improves SA by identifying the salient pieces of information from the flood of potentially relevant text presented to a user.  By reducing the time spent reading irrelevant information or searching for data that may pertain to the user&quot;s current activities, CHART reduces the text-to-time ratio, improving SA.    Furthermore, by reducing the amount of time a user must spend reading to maintain an appropriate level of SA, the CHART system makes additional time available for other functions.  Improved SA also allows Warfighters to construct more detailed and accurate projections of the future status of an operation or situation.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The objective of this program proposed by Spectral Energies, LLC and University of Texas at Austin is to develop a novel framework for optimal design of sensors and actuators for use in closed-loop control of dual-mode scramjet engines. In Phase I, the framework was developed by analyzing new measurements of unstart in Mach 2 inlet-isolator, which could be perturbed by a downstream flap and/or upstream pulsed air jets. A new algorithm (CUSUM) was developed, which enables superior detection of shock propagation using pressure data. Furthermore, system identification of the Mach 2 data revealed that linear dynamic models were largely inadequate in representing the dynamics. In contrast, nonlinear models performed well for predicting data for large variations in flap angle and jet pulsing frequency. In Phase II, a new wind tunnel model will be used that enables improved control of the boundary layer, more robust control schemes and a broader range of sensors to be applied. The Phase II analysis will develop a more robust framework that is validated under a wider range of conditions, with different sensors and actuators, and under non-reacting and reacting flow conditions. The framework will also be applied to achieve closed-loop control of unstart under both cold and reacting conditions.  BENEFIT:  The proposed research effort will make significant progress toward achieving critically needed sensor and actuator performance characterization data to enable the robust design of active control systems for scramjet engines. Military and commercial applications include but not limited to space launch vehicles, time-critical weapon systems, strike/reconnaissance vehicles, and systems related to space access.",

IFOS will exploit innovative techniques, employing the latest advances in photonics and system-level performance optimization, within a ruggedized package designed for the harsh launch and flight environments.

        "abstract": "Tick borne diseases pose a significant threat to deployed military forces and local civilian populations. Different species of ticks vector different pathogens; therefore it is important to be able to differentiate numerous species of ticks at any stage of their life cycle. Evogen has optimized the extraction and purification of tick DNA from whole tick bodies and individual tick legs. This purified DNA has been tested against primer and probe designs to 16S rDNA and the ITS2 gene targets. Based on these results, additional gene targets have been selected for evaluation: COI, COII, COB, 12 S RNA, and the mt Control Region. Using representative ticks from North America, these gene targets will be amplified, sequenced, and analyzed to facilitate the design of molecular assays to perform species level identification. HyBeacons probes will be designed for each of the gene targets providing the ability to perform qPCR and high resolution melt curve analysis. A deployable tick assay will provide clinicians with the ability to conduct rapid and accurate surveillance of the vector population of ticks and provide an additional estimate of human encounters with infected ticks. This information will support significant efforts to protect military forces and civilian populations",

We will realize prototype hardware that will extend the co-site interference mitigation performance achieved in Phase I while conforming to the physical/spatial and environmental constraints of the intended submarine phased array antenna system. Our proposed co-site mitigation technologies comprise a passive RF isolation circuit that provides electromagnetic isolation between a closely located narrowband transmit array and wideband receive array and a photonic interference cancellation technique that can be easily integrated with a fiber-optic RF signal distribution architecture for transmission of the phased array aperture signals. Our co-site mitigation technologies do not require any modification of the phased array antenna elements, can work together to maximize the amount of co-site interferer suppression, and can be architected to minimize the impact on SWaP (size, weight, and power). During the Phase II program we will carry out extensive design, fabrication, and performance testing activities. Our developed prototype co-site mitigation technologies will then be demonstrated and experimentally validated in representative hardware demonstrator test platforms.",

        "abstract": "Electroplated hard chrome is used extensively for aerospace and industrial applications because it is wear resistant, corrosion resistant, has a good surface finish and has good adhesion. Naval aircraft use chrome plating on landing gear components because of these characteristics. However these coatings eventually wear and have to be stripped and replaced. Stripping the chrome coating requires the use of acid baths, which generate waste through air borne contaminants, spills, drag-out, and bath fluid disposal after chemical activity is reduced. Naval facilities are faced with increasing costs to comply with regulations concerning these hazardous waste streams. Ormond&#039;s solution, demonstrated in Phase I, is to replace these chemical baths with waterjet cavitation stripping which can economically strip hard chrome using only water that can be recycled in a closed loop system. The equipment required is readily available at Navy Repair and Overhaul centers which allows for rapid adoption of the technology at low cost to the government. The process differs from the high pressure waterjet stripping used to remove thermal barrier coatings only in that it uses Ormond&#039;s cavitating nozzles to effect rapid coating removal without damage to the substrate.

The PASN tool uses a sachet with predefined amount of adhesive and an injector guide to mitigate the risk of foreign object debris. The PASN tool is compatible with the current approach of placing nutplates in a nitrogen-filled bag for use without further preparation, directly addressing the Air Force&quot;s requirements. In Phase I, POC successfully demonstrated PASN feasibility through design and fabrication of PASN prototypes and creating a solution plan with cost estimates and a transition plan. The Phase I prototype operates with consistent, premeasured, and prepackaged amount of adhesives and provides uniform dispensing of the adhesive on the nutplate base. In Phase II, POC plans to further test and mature the design and demonstrate the process in a representative production environment with a detailed cost comparison and transition plan. Testing for the adhesive&quot;s strength, shelf life, and other properties will be performed.  BENEFIT:  Military applications of the Pull and Stick Nutplate (PASN) process will include vehicular and structural platforms that require adhesive nutplate installation. POC has established working contacts with DOD prime aircraft and nutplate manufacturers to help in the transition of the PASN process into the aircraft manufacturing process. The PASN process can be incorporated by the Air Force into installation processes involving modern aircraft. Commercial applications of the PASN process include the transportation industry, where the PASN process can be utilized in the construction of civilian aircraft, sea vessels, and ground transportation.

It also includes parsing of relative location expressions (&#039;&#039;three miles west,&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;between Mosul and Tikrit&#039;&#039;), linking events and their corresponding locations appearing in the same sentence, and determining the location of an event when its location is not explicitly mentioned in the same sentence.  BENEFIT:  The main anticipated benefit of this work involves working software that automatically extracts and geocodes locations corresponding to events as they occur in unstructured data.  These are especially useful in enhancing event visualization from such data.  In addition, the proposed software should be able to extract information that is only implicitly mentioned in the text, which is one step beyond what most systems can produce.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  There is a growing need for timely processing, exploitation, and distribution of sensor data collected by unmanned aerial vehicles to generate actionable intelligence. Challenges exist in producing hardware that is rugged enough to withstand the physical demands of airborne platforms, yet able to deliver significant computing performance within the size, weight and power constraints of smaller airframes. CG proposes to create an Embedded Avionics High Performance Computing (EA-HPC) system that will meet this need. This will include hardware for sensor capture, raw data storage, sensor data processing, and interfacing with the aircraft communication system. The system will also contain software to enhance the raw data, detect potential targets, fuse sensor inputs, and track targets using midwave infrared and hyperspectral imaging sensors. The innovation present in this design will be to provide choices between three state-of-the-art processing elements: (1) Conventional general purpose Central Processing Units (CPUs), (2) Modern CUDA-compatible Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), (2) Power efficient and flexible multicore accelerators. The solution will scale easily from one to multiple sensors with minimal effort. This will allow a wider variety of missions to be executed without major refitting.    BENEFIT:  This approach will produce a platform with high processing efficiency in GFLOPS/Watt, and the scalability to adapt to different sensor configurations in addition to developing software to exploit the sensor data. The systems small footprint will contain a powerful assortment of computing capabilities that can accelerate a variety of sensor processing algorithms. The onboard processing of vehicle tracks will make it possible to send the tracking results to the ground station instead of all the imagery. This reduces the communication bandwidth required while increasing the usability of the transmitted data.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The Military has a critical need for a tactical weapon to engage soft, fixed targets in remote areas. A system is needed to operate semi-autonomously to destroy or disable nearby targets in support of base defense and a variety of other soft target applications within a 30km range. Brock Technologies Kinetic Fan Tactical Missile (KFTM) developed under this Phase II effort will address these issues with its modular nose, fuselage, and tail sections capable of supporting a variety of effects and expanded Guidance, Navigation, and Control systems including Automatic Target Recognition (ATR). The KFTM design is a weaponized, fire-and-forget system launched locally or remotely from a ground tube-launching crate capable of deploying multiple vehicles in quick succession without man-in-the-loop. By utilizing a systems engineering approach and advanced manufacturing techniques, the prototype systems developed under the Phase II effort will lead to a final tube-launched flight demonstration including a mock effects payload with vision based terminal guidance engaging a stationary target at a known location.  BENEFIT:  The focus of this technology is the support of Forward Operated Base (FOB) defense needs. However, other Military organizations, border surveillance groups, Search And Rescue (SAR) teams, and researchers could all benefit from a tube launched UAS with the capability to position effects on targets in remote areas. The KFTM could provide support to law enforcement groups via the deployment of non-lethal weapons against rioting crowds or illegal border crossers. A system with a range of 30km and fire-and-forget operation would allow the vehicle to be launched quickly, easily, thereby increasing the coverage area of the system while reducing the risks associated with deployment of similar hand-launched, slow flying weaponized UAS. Furthermore, the tube launched KFTM is an ideal candidate for US Coast Guard applications. Ship protection from pirate activities is a viable mission for the KFTM since the system is inaudible and difficult to spot from very low altitudes. The variable effects payload capabilities of the KFTM could also permit non-lethal engagement of drug or human smuggling activities continually occurring along our borders without risking Coast Guard or Border Patrol personnel.",

CLOSER is designed to operate with no coolant leakage and eliminates the need to replenish lubricants and replace contact seals, which are otherwise subject to friction-based wear and tear, by utilizing a passively temperature-controlled array of frictionless ferrofluidic seals. The goal of the Phase II effort is to manufacture a CLOSER union prototype that successfully demonstrates the required capabilities necessary for integration, provides significant performance and cost benefits as compared to current systems, and exhibits effectiveness and suitability for PMS320.

For critical missions, it is necessary to&quot;fight through&quot;cyber attacks in order to achieve mission objectives.  Such a&quot;survivable&quot;network would be capable of carrying on during an attack, continuing to provide critical services.    The ATC-NY team will create the Fight-Through Node (FTN), a combined hardware/software system to enhance existing networks with survivability properties.  Fight-Through Nodes are designed to replace nodes hosting mission-critical services in a network.  Networks equipped with FTNs will be resilient, enabling critical processes to operate despite server compromises.    In Phase I ATC-NY demonstrated feasibility of the FTN concept with a proof-of-concept simulator and benchmarking of critical processes.  We produced a detailed design for implementation in Phase II.  Finally, we developed a detailed commercialization strategy based on market research and are confident we can transition our FTN product into DoD and civilian enterprises.    BENEFIT:  As the DoD and private enterprise rely ever more heavily on their information systems, the frequency and sophistication of cyber attacks continues to rise.  ATC-NY&#039;s Fight-Through Nodes (FTNs) will improve the survivability of a network&#039;s critical server nodes, making it possible to fight through cyber attacks.  Rather than being disabled by such attacks, servers providing mission-critical services will continue to operate in spite of successful host compromises.  The DoD can use FTNs to replace critical nodes on Mission Assurance Category (MAC) I, II, and III DoD information systems.  The mission assurance provided by FTNs will also appeal to critical infrastructure enterprises in the civilian sector (e.g., utilities, health care, financial, transportation).",

To accelerate the time from receipt of RFI to product generation, analysts must have systems and algorithms at their disposal that allow them to manage and exploit this immense amount of information in an efficient and effective manner.  Black River&quot;s approach will address both needs with the development of MOVINT exploitation algorithms and a distributed Database Management System (DBMS); by improving both a synergistic effect is achieved.  The MOVINT exploitation algorithms will automate current manual processes as well as enhance the raw intelligence to allow for rapid RFI fulfillment.  The distributed DBMS utilizes state of the art technology to enhance the ingestion, storage, retrieval, and extraction of the intelligence as well as moves the algorithm processing from the analyst workstation to a powerful, distributed computing cluster; thus removing a common bottleneck in the MOVINT exploitation process.  Ultimately, we will deliver this distributed system with integrated algorithms to AFRL and demonstrate accelerated MOVINT exploitation.  BENEFIT:  The proposed MOVINT exploitation algorithms will provide analysts with automated processing and novel information to accelerate servicing of RFIs and will support current and developing MTI enterprises that provide plug-in capabilities.  The distributed DBMS provides a research test-bed for users to continue development of improved data mining and data handling techniques that support evolving analyst RFI requirements as well as supplies a system that advances the management of current MOVINT data volumes and is capable of supporting greater, future volumes.",

The proposal is for continuation of work in Phase I Option Award N68335-10-C-0173, Innovative Materials for Highly Loaded Wear Applications in Arresting Gear Tailhook Components. The significance of this work is that processes have been developed for the surface modification of steels to provide excellent wear and corrosion resistance. The processes are resistant to impact and scuffing type abrasion encountered in arresting of aircraft. The hard, wear resistant surface would increase service life of tailhook assemblies at lower cost because, compared to today&quot;s technology, the time and material cost to chemically modify the surface should be less than half. The processes have been developed, and the Phase II effort will be used to determine whether less expensive steels can be used, and to scale up to further reduce cost of the assemblies. The process employs high temperature to introduce carbon or nitrogen to the surface. Diffusion occurs and the carbon or nitrogen reacts with elements within the alloy to create a hard, wear and corrosion resistant surface.",

This program will develop a feature-aided tracking and performance modeling to dynamically compute measures of track performance, particularly distributions on track kinematic, association, and continuity, on a track-by-track basis, enabling users of that track information, whether human or automated, to perform the functions above.  The performance model will be modular, enabling integration with both the baseline tracker we use for testing as well as other trackers.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Over the past few years, the Air Force has increased the emphasis on probabilistic methods for design reliability predictions of fracture critical engine components, including metallic turbine engine blades and disks. A significant shortcoming and potential source of conservatism of most current life prediction tools and methodologies is the reliance on stress intensity factor values obtained from highly idealized component and crack geometries.  In Phase I, we demonstrated that this shortcoming could be overcome by making an existing high fidelity 3D crack growth simulator work together with an existing probabilistic life prediction code.  The resulting prototype software tool was used to perform a probabilistic life prediction for a geometrically complex engine component.  For Phase II, we propose to develop the prototype software into a tool suitable for routine production use.  This will include creating a unified graphical user interface, adding additional features, performing sensitivity studies that will assess accuracy/efficiency tradeoffs and develop best practices, and performing a series of analyses that include advanced life prediction topics.  BENEFIT:  The successful completion of Phase II will result in a high fidelity probabilistic fatigue life prediction tool for metallic turbine engine components.  Such a tool will allow engine manufacturers to reduce uncertainty and conservatism in fatigue life assessments. This means that for current engine designs, component lives or inspection intervals can be extended with no increased risk of failure.  For new engine designs, the tool can be used to help find the optimal point among performance, efficiency, and life cycle cost.  The tool can be used by the government to perform high accuracy fracture risk assessments independent of the manufacturers.  The tool can also be applied to other applications with fracture critical components, such as airframes and power generation turbines, among others.",

The design uses widely-available and low cost components with a design for easy assembly. With its small size, low cost and low power consumption, this system is ideally suited for use on small, disposable UAVs launched through a standard sonobuoy tube. Disposable UAVs may be deployed from a larger high altitude platform and allowed to fly closer to the ocean, providing the maximum possible magnetic signal from underwater targets.",

        "abstract": "Purpose: Braille is the primary medium of written communication for persons who are blind. Prior research shows that Braille literacy strongly correlates with stronger reading habits and the pursuit of higher education, whereas Braille illiteracy negatively impacts students' academic performance and ability to navigate the everyday world. A recent report found that there has been a dramatic decline in Braille literacy since the 1960s and that in the last two decades the literacy rate among blind children has persisted at just 10 percent. This project will develop a web-based tutoring system to provide on-demand Braille literacy support to the visually impaired.\n\nProject Activities: The main technological objectives include designing and implementing a user interface for dynamic Braille input and output, designing a rules-based expert system for the Braille curriculum, and designing a rules-based expert system to analyze student work and provide feedback. To assess implementation feasibility, the usability of the technology, and to gather data on the promise of the product to support student learning, a single-case pilot study will collect data from 50 students over 15 weeks. Outcome measures will include items from the Minnesota Braille Skills Inventory.\n\n",

Despite the differences between the languages, students who use ASL are typically assessed with protocols for English-speaking students, as few exist specifically for students who use ASL. Not surprisingly, prior research shows that tests administered in English to ASL students often do not provide an accurate measure of progress. This project will develop a reliable testing mechanism to evaluate deaf individuals who communicate with ASL in the areas of vocabulary knowledge and reading comprehension.\n\nProject Activities: After content is selected, mockups will be scripted to be visually appealing and easy to navigate by ASL students. Next, programming language will be authored to enable users to interact with the software, and videos will be produced to support implementation. Each of the components will be iteratively tested with students and teachers until complete. To assess implementation feasibility, the usability of the technology, and the validity of the product to provide accurate assessments, the final version of the assessments will be used in 10 classrooms over a 1-month period.

        "abstract": "Purpose: Students with high functioning autism spectrum disorders (HF-ASD) face unique challenges with social skills and social relationships, often experiencing heightened levels of social isolation and exclusion from social opportunities. Without intervention, these social difficulties can interfere significantly with students\u2019 ability to engage in and learn at school. However, few social interventions are available that are both evidence-based and feasible to implement in a school. Further, products that allow educators to simultaneously implement a social intervention and measure its impact on students\u2019 social functioning are lacking. This project will develop a fully interactive computer-based social intervention for elementary school students with HF-ASD.\n\nProject Activities: The development process will entail designing graphics for the characters and scenery, scripting the hierarchy of dialog and behavioral menu choices available to the student, defining the scoring algorithms for assessing social problem solving, and integrating instructional content. The research team will use a mixed-meth design to assess the prototype with 45 students and a group of teachers, and then make iterative refinements based on feedback. After development is complete, research will assess the feasibility and usability, and promise of the product to improve social functioning in 50 special education classrooms.

        "abstract": "Purpose: In education research, the standardized mean difference (symbolized by d) is the predominant effect size index. It is calculated as the difference between the treatment-group and control-group means, divided by the pooled standard deviation. Using d allows the impacts of education interventions to be compared even when they have been evaluated using different measures or study designs. Calculating d is relatively straightforward for simple-randomized trials. However, calculating d becomes difficult when using cluster-randomized trials (CRTs). Previous work to develop formulas to compute effect size d and its standard error for CRTs ended up identifying the complexity of the procedure and the additional difficulties raised by the use of real data. This project will develop a computer program that can be used by mainstream education researchers to compute d and its standard error for both researchers conducting CRTs and researchers working with published data from CRTs conducted by others.\n\nProject Activities: The project will develop a software program to calculate d and its standard error for CRTs. Five modules (each for a different type of CRT including two 2-level and three 3-level designs) will be developed and these will be united by a common interface for entering, saving, retrieving, and exporting data. Development will include different formulas for each design and for each d within each design. Simulated data, for which the actual d's and their standard errors are known, will be used to evaluate the validity of results produced by each module. The computer program will address four complications for the calculation of d and its standard error for CRTs that occur when: (1) defining the effect size; (2) computing d; (3) computing the standard error of d; and (4) working with published data for which inappropriate analysis was used. In defining the effect size, CRTs offer more than one population that can be used as the reference (e.g., for a student-in-school design the reference can be all students, all students within a single school, or all schools). The standard deviation used in calculating d will vary depending on the reference population. Complicated adjustments must be made when computing d and its standard error. When using data reported from incorrect analysis, complicated adjustments must be to done to impute the results that would have been reported if appropriate analysis had been performed.\n\n",

With major advances in public policy, it is now more common that all students (regardless of such disabilities) be integrated within schools and in classrooms.

This project will develop a platform to enrich STEM learning among students with (or without) visual impairments.\n\nProject Activities: After mock-ups are completed, prototypes of the multi-media learning applications (apps) will be developed.

The goals of this collaborative effort are to provide a mutually beneficial research and commercialization platform where SBIR/STTR Phase II grantees can perform collaborative research with ERC faculty, researchers, and graduate students, to strengthen the capacity of their firms, and/or speed the transition of ERC advances to the marketplace. In accordance with the NSF solicitation NSF 10-617, Evigia Systems, Inc has submitted a request for additional funding. The sub-awardee identified in the funding request is the University of Michigan. This proposal meets the requirements of the solicitation NSF 10-617. In attempting to use record environmental changes by scavenging the energy associated with such changes, the proposed collaborative work explores important fundamental concepts for microsystems. The project brings together the long-range ultra-low energy wireless circuits developed at the University of Michigan Engineering Research Center for Wireless Integrated Microsystems (WIMS) with Evigia&#039;s batteryless sensor labels with embedded non-volatile memory. The development of such Microsystems is synergistic with research now being pursued in WIMS. The ultra-low power wireless circuit technologies developed at ERC if not combined with low-power sensing and electronics will not provide the wide advantage over competing technologies. The ultra-low power batteryless sensing, digital memory and electronics technologies developed by Evigia will meet the initial demands of the market as these circuit blocks dominate the power consumption in batteryless operation, yet cannot hold the market position over time without maintaining a longer-range operation over competing technologies and solutions that will be introduced over time. Long range unpowered wireless sensors have clear and compelling uses. There is an identified market and need, from object tracking to environmental and infrastructure monitoring. The proposal to store the small amount of energy needed to run the chip for a short while on a MEMS isolated on-chip capacitor is, if not entirely novel, a good design choice. The suggestion of using a Walton voltage multiplier to gather energy from even weak RF radiation fields over time is an excellent reuse of an existent concept in a novel application. This proposal rests solidly on developed engineering. The proposal has the potential to give consumers and industrial users an improved sensor. This sensor can store and report the health of the product, thereby reducing waste and improving the logistics of the delivery system. Students and faculty members will gain valuable experience by interaction with an SBIR company. Students will gain important experience from using actual industrial processes that will make them able to contribute to a multi-discipline team as soon as they graduate.",

Nitric oxide has been shown to enhance the wound healing process as well as act as a powerful antibacterial agent.  However, delivery of nitric oxide to a wound area is extremely challenging because NO is a gas.  Zeomedixs approach is to use zeolites that bind NO molecules when exposed to a stream of gaseous NO.  When NO-loaded zeolites come in contact with water (or wound fluid), NO is released into the wound area.    The overall goal of Zeomedixs Phase II project is to develop an optimal NO-zeolite wound dressing for treating infected acute wounds.   Our technical approach can be organized into three steps:  (1) Develop three different NO-zeolite wound dressing prototypes, consisting of NO-zeolite ointment enclosed within a semi-porous pouch, each having distinct nitric oxide release rates.  (2) Characterize the storage stability, cytotoxicity, and antimicrobial efficacy of the prototypes against both planktonic microorganisms and bacterial biofilms in vitro.

RETAs innovative design integrates mature materials and fabrication processes with POC-developed and COTS components. In Phase I, POC designed, fabricated, and tested RETA prototypes that produced visible light and near-infrared without causing bloom effect to night-vision goggles/devices. The demonstrated prototypes eject no combusting material and are only perceptible to the shooter and friendly forces near the shooter while maintaining imperceptibility to foes. The prototypes mass remained unchanged throughout the combustion process, unaffecting their lethality and range. The inert nature of the material in RETA allows it to have a long shelf life with reliable performance. These results led to a preliminary producibility analysis that strengthens the manufacturability of RETA. In Phase II, POC will optimize the fabrication process and fabricate complete live RETA rounds to demonstrate their capability in military weapons of 5.56mm, 7.62mm, and .50 cal. and to test their capability of integrating and operating within Army operational architecture.",

MiniMAC is based on high-precision optics and compound-eye design, providing high resolution and WFOV. The innovations in using the high-precision, diffractive, and highly aspheric compound-eye optics and focal-plane-array tiling enable the MiniMACs FOV (180 deg x 90 deg), high-resolution (submicron), and small form-factor to directly meet the Armys requirements. In Phase I, POC successfully demonstrated the feasibility of the MiniMAC system by simulation, component development, and building a working proof-of-concept prototype, showing a scalable WFOV of&gt;180 deg x 90 deg, with resolution capable of acquiring 1 cm detail at 10 m distance. In Phase II, POC will further develop a modular system that can be included in precision, tactical/protective networked munitions, enabling WFOV and resolution in handheld or robotic applications.

        "abstract": "As multi-tasking demands continue to grow across Navy environments, the potential costs of multi-tasking, such as high workload and degraded situation awareness, could be the difference between mission success or failure. Hence, there is a need to measure and evaluate multi-tasking to identify issues and develop acceptable solutions. However, current approaches typically remain overly specific to a certain paradigm or collection of tasks. Aptima proposes to fill this gap by developing a flexible measurement system that facilitates rigorous evaluations of multi-tasking performance. Relying on a universal, empirically-driven framework of multi-tasking measurement, Aptima&quot;s approach will utilize: (1) libraries of domain-agnostic and domain-specific performance measures; (2) a measure selection tool that adapts the measure libraries appropriately to a given environment; and (3) measurement software that executes the selected measures. As measures are collected, the proposed system will provide evaluators with the necessary data to identify multi-tasking costs, assess the risks associated with those costs, and devise potential mitigation strategies. In addition, Aptima&quot;s solution will be designed to integrate with a range of test beds, while maintaining flexibility to account for future assessment tools that consume the generated multi-tasking data.",

The successful development of DDM thermal controls will prevent defects/flaws (porosity from cold processing) or inhomogeneous deposits (non-uniform microstructure). The innovation combines a multi-view thermal imaging sensor suite, finite element method (thermal/metallurgical) models and real-time software algorithms to control the DDM process parameters. The imaging sensors will provide thermal measurements in real-time by viewing the melt pool along the laser axis and by viewing the side of the deposit. A thermal status of the deposit is monitored and controlled by adjustment of process parameters, to guide the DDM process, so that specified and uniform microstructure is achieved.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The advent of cognitive radio networks (CRNs) presents myriad security threats, which inspires a growing need for increased capabilities for discovering and localizing non-cooperative nodes with either a selfish or malicious intent. In this proposal, Intelligent Automation, Inc. (IAI), along with its collaborators, propose to develop a Multi-Level Detection and Localization approach to defense against the intentional hidden node problem in CRNs. Our approach is based on our extensive investigation and understanding of the intentional hidden node problems in the context of CRNs, and utilizing mechanisms from multiple disciplines including RF characterization, anomaly/misuse detection, and localization. In Phase I, we have designed the system architecture and performed feasibility studies. In Phase II, we will implement a system prototype and test the system in terms of detection accuracy, efficiency, and robustness.  BENEFIT:  We note that hidden node detection and localization is a vital military issue that needs to be resolved. The proposed solution has potential to greatly tighten the security of future cognitive radio networks for military and commercial applications. Such potential DoD acquisition programs include but not limited to WIN-T, TTNT, WNW, N-CDL, JTRS GMR, and JTRS HMS. The proposed effort will provide an efficient detection and localization capability that enables secure CRN operation with heterogeneous communication demands in a distributed operation. There also exist a variety of commercial applications for the proposed multi-level hidden node detection system for heterogenous communications, such as transitioning this service to the communications industry for use in software-defined-radio (SDR) products and cellular networks. Packaging the proposed solution with the Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) SDR hardware would increase the performance of standard networks. The defined market for SDR is rapidly expanding. Venture Development Corp. forecasts that the overall market for SDR will grow at a 31-percent rate from $2.2 billion (USD) in 2006 to nearly $10 billion by 2011. Such a large market need will help attract a great amount of potential investment.",

        "abstract": "The results of the Phase I activities confirm the feasibility of using the swept frequency FD-OCT approach for measuring the separation and relative amplitude of optical elements withing a seeker at long range. In the Phase I analysis it was shown that various methods, including the originally proposed approach, suffer from significant technical challenges or simply do not work. In contrast the FD-OCT approach address all of the technical challenges associated with the CLIRCM problem. Furthermore, results from a limited laboratory demonstration were used to validate the approach. The overall technical objective of the Phase II program is to develop a FD-OCT brass board system capable of detecting and identifying an optical seeker at a range of up to 1 km. The plan for this activity is to use sensors and sources at a laser wavelength of 1.5 microns for the purposes of cost and technical risk reduction. Because of the added costs of component development associated with MWIR technology the proposed program approach reduces overall risk and focuses the efforts on the engineering associated with the long range FD-OCT detection technique rather than MWIR technology components. While feasibility of this approach in the MWIR spectral band does require some level of component development, those efforts are being proposed in a separate, parallel, effort.",

However, current C2 technology does not actively measure, define, or represent the Commanders contextual framework, which can lead to a failure by Commanders and supporting teams to access important contextual information over time. To fill this gap, Aptima, proposes to develop the Cross-Context Ontology Reasoning Environment (CrossCORE), an agent-based cross-platform server for defining, measuring, and managing a Commanders contextual information within C2 networks. CrossCORE leverages and expands upon Aptimas context representation research, and formally encapsulates contextual elements into a schema housed within intelligent agents. A unique aspect of this approach is an implicit model that measures Commander interactions with a C2 system to make inferences about activities and goals that provide key inputs to the CrossCORE contextual representation. The CrossCORE agents mediate the flow of C2 data by acting in response to critical contextual information, adding saliency to particular elements of interest on the common operating picture, and collaborating with other CrossCORE agents to support the information needs of multiple levels of Commanders.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Kigre proposes to develop and integrate unique radiation hardened, athermal, 1.5um laser gain materials and pumping architectures into high performance optical laser amplifier devices for SATCOM applications.  The approach employs long life radiation tolerant pump diodes configured for direct side pumping of large mode area laser glass gain elements.  Traditional single mode fiber laser amplifier designs are limited in terms of pump power, stability, noise, gain and power.  Direct side pumping circumvents traditional laser amplifier issues with simpler, smaller and more scaleable architectures.  They may be made into radiation hardened high power laser devices that provide reliable, rugged, temperature insensitive solutions for stable, low noise operation. Erbium glass gain materials are identified as ideal for use in laser amplifiers designed for satellite communications.  This high gain laser glass provides numerous property advantages such as high gain, low heat fraction, high cross section, broad bandwidth, high solubility for rear-earth ions, insensitivity to concentration quenching, low upconversion losses, ability to self-compensate for induced strain/lensing due thermal loading, high energy storage and stable high gain laser amplifier performance in relatively short (compact) gain lengths.  BENEFIT:  Compact high efficiency radiation resistant HESP laser amplifiers would have potential commercial applications in free-space ground and satellite communications. Other commercial applications may include laser radar, collision avoidance, laser plasma spectroscopy, laser ignition and medicine.  Military markets include satellite communications, LAser Detection And Ranging (LADAR), LIght Detection And Ranging (LIDAR), tracking, atmospheric sensing, targeting, illumination Additional applications include directed energy, long range eye-safe laser terrain mapping and laser designation.",

The proposed AVERT system will include automatic video processing, global fusion and tracking, adversarial reasoning and prediction logic, automatic UMS feedback control, and an Android-based application for a handheld device. Using Toyon&#039;s custom GeoTrack embedded hardware, the video processing and global fusion and tracking capabilities will exist in parallel on-board the UMS and on the ground station, adding flexibility to the system architecture. The on-board processing enables AVERT to operate with a decentralized architecture; each UMS can operate autonomously, but a wireless network can support data sharing for collaborative actions between several UMS. The on-board functionality will also enable the Android app and device to receive video, telemetry, and track data directly from all UMS within radio range, without hopping through a ground station. The handheld operator can also input ISR requests to the handheld that will be processed by the UMS. Toyon&#039;s field-proven video processing algorithms will automatically detect moving targets in video. Target detections will be automatically geo-registered using sensor state data from the platform GPS and IMU, then fused into target tracks in the ground plane, enabling autonomous tracking even in urban and complex environments. Ground plane tracks will be sent to the UMS operator for viewing, and passed on to UMS control algorithms. Our control algorithms will use adversarial modeling to anticipate potentially evasive actions of the target, then optimize the platform trajectory and sensor orientation to obtain clear-line-of-sight to the target and maintain persistent surveillance.",

TRI proposes to use its three decade background in accelerated life testing; failure analysis; and composites to develop a thorough understanding of how radome materials degrade with age and usage.  TRIs polymers group will also recommend substitute materials to reduce dielectric property degradation.  TRIs Nondestructive Inspection (NDI) group will lead the effort to develop NDI processes for assessing dielectric property degradation.  In Phase I, the team manufactured samples from cyanate ester resins with astroquartz reinforcement. Samples were then artificially aged to various levels by exposure to aggressive environments. The research team conducted microwave NDI of the panels to assess dielectric property degradation versus aging.  Microscopy and spectroscopy indicates that degradation was primarily mechanical.   Inspection results indicate that microwave NDI correlates well to dielectric changes caused by radome aging.     Phase II will provide more realistic accelerated aging in more realistic samples to confirm degradation mechanisms.  Microwave NDI processes will be greatly expanded, and data correlated to radar performance as well as aging and dielectric property changes.  In addition, there are several materials replacement options for decreasing those degradation mechanisms.  BENEFIT:  The primary benefits learned from the Phase I outcome is that the degradation appears to dominated by mechanical aging and that handheld microwave instruments offer the promise to monitor the resulting decreases in dielectric performance over time. Phase II accelerated aging methods will provide more detailed information about the degradation mechanisms. Furthermore, there are several methods to reduce the damage caused by mechanical aging.  There are tens of thousands radomes used for military and commercial aircraft, ground-based radar, weather radar, coast warning radar, and ship radar. All of these radomes would benefit from a better understanding of how radomes dielectric properties degrade; implementation of materials that age more gracefully; and ultimately a fielded nondestructive tool to measure dielectric properties without far field testing.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The objective of this project is to develop nondestructive evaluation technology to locate and characterize defects and damage in ceramic matrix composite material with sufficient quantification to be usable in material performance models.  The Evisive microwave interferometry technique has been successfully applied to nondestructive examination and determination of density and porosity in S-200 ceramic matrix composite (CMC) material.  In Phase I of this project, delaminations and macro-pores in an S-200 part were detected, sized and located in depth using the Evisive microwave technique and validated with micro-focus x-ray computed tomography.  20 simultaneous, discrete depth images, and 3D data file output were demonstrated.  In Phase II this technology will be used to quantify characteristics of known defects, which will be destructively analyzed and used to validate models for prediction of material performance and live prediction.  Inspection speed, data output and quantitative validation will be suitable for use in material property prediction for parts.  Evisive scan microwave interferometry requires no contact and no coupling media, and supports real time evaluation.  The project will leverage these characteristics to provide practical testing strategies for manufacturing and in-service environments.  The project is anticipated to extend methodology applicable to manufacturing of S-200 material to advanced materials.    BENEFIT:  CMC materials offer higher temperature capability, reduced weight, and improved durability compared to conventional materials.  They are potential suitable for a variety of high temperature structural applications in turbine engines and elsewhere.  In order to apply the material, it is necessary to develop models which are able to predict material performance and degradation associated with deviations in design properties; and to predict material longevity.  Evisive Scan microwave interferometry has been demonstrated to be effective in nondestructive testing of S-200 and similar CMC material.  Development of quantitative NDE measurements which are sufficiently precise and repeatable to support modeling of the material properties will enable prediction of useful life, and enable use of the material in many novel and highly effective applications.  Replicating these NDE methods in the in-service environment will enable condition monitoring and effective application of the material.  Effective quantification of manufacturing irregularities and in-service degradation will facilitate migration of the material into service applications, as well as supporting advancement of the CMC material itself.  Efficient NDE process and manufacturing quality control will reduce manufacturing cost and further enable migration of the CMC materials into service applications.  This proposal includes letters from Alliant Techsystems Inc. (ATK), COI Ceramics, Inc.

        "abstract": "Cold spray has many benefits compared to conventional thermal spray including lower deposition temperatures, higher bond strengths, less substrate preparation and better control of coating composition, phase structure, and oxide contamination. In cold spray, particles are accelerated by an expanding gas to 180-1200 m/s, where they collide with a substrate to form a coating on the surface in the solid state. Since reduced deposition temperatures are used, coatings have the same properties as the initial particles. However, in the cold spray process, particles smaller than 5 microns in diameter have insufficient momentum to penetrate a shock wave region next to the substrate. Nanoparticles offer many benefits in strength, hardness, and reactivity but are unable to be used in the cold spray process due to insufficient mass and, therefore, momentum. In the Phase I project, Eltron developed a method for spray drying agglomerates of nanoparticles for use in the cold spray process. Spray drying is a low-cost, well-established powder processing method used often in the food and catalyst industries. The objectives of this Phase II project include: 1) produce larger (10-20 lb.) batches of powder for consolidation by cold spray at the Army Research Laboratory, 2) develop a system for consolidating smaller, more reactive, un-passivated metal particles, 3) determine the effect of slurry flow rate, nozzle diameter, gas flow rate, nanoparticle size, binder concentration and binder choice with larger volume slurries on agglomerate morphology, size, and size distribution, 4) characterize agglomerates using optical and scanning electron microscopy, chemical analysis, density measurements, x-ray diffraction, and surface area/pore size and volume analysis, and 5) optimize economic considerations including nanoparticle, metallic binder precursor, and solvent costs, leading to an estimate of powder costs when produced on a commercial scale. Work towards these objectives will lead to a flexible process for producing relatively inexpensive nanostructured powders that enables use of a variety of nanoparticle compositions and particle sizes (from 10 200 nm). During Phase II, larger volume slurries will be optimized and process variables will be determined to best prepare for scale-up to production levels of 100 lbs/day (during Phase III).",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  ReliaCoat Technologies, LLC, a Stony Brook University based spin-off, in conjunction with program advisors GE Aviation, Sulzer Metco, Cincinnati Thermal Spray and other spray applicators proposes to design, develop and commercialize an advanced thermal spray process control strategy with user-friendly software. The innovation is based on a progressive control strategy from feedstock powder to coating properties, incorporating decision gates within each operational sub-domain of the process while simultaneously considering integrated effects. A product (coating) based process-control strategy is envisaged to address the core issues of reliability and performance. Critical parameters under consideration include particle injection, comprehensive particle properties, deposit stress evolution dynamics and advanced coating properties. The program will be aided by emerging capabilities in control systems, process and coating diagnostics and mapping strategies for design and reliability. The principle focus of the work will be advanced thermal barrier coatings, with potential for expansion into other materials (CrC-NiCr, Tribaloy, abradabes) and range thermal spray processes (e.g. HVOF). In concert with program partner Sulzer Metco, integration of advanced concepts and software to existing and new process controllers will be considered along with field demonstration at production sites such as CTS and eventually Tinker Air Force Base.  BENEFIT:  Thermal spray coatings are crucial to economic, safe and reliable operation of gas turbine engines used for propulsion and energy generation. Both US military and commercial turbine industry uses a vast array of thermal spray coatings both in original equipment manufacture, and in overhaul and repair.  This represents a multi-billion dollar industry in the US. Thermal spray processes as they are applied in many sites around the country and the world have a number of issues with process reliability and control which affect the performance and durability of this important class of coatings. Enhancements in process understanding and control through science derived strategies will be of great benefit to both military and civilian applications of thermal spray coatings.  Not withstanding performance and durability benefits, process enhancements can pay for itself through cost savings associated with reduced rework, increased efficiency and productivity.",

In several recent development efforts, it has been demonstrated that manmade objects have a significantly stronger polarization signal than natural backgrounds resulting in good contrast that complements the conventionally imaged infrared signature. Significant data has been collected in the MWIR and LWIR portions of the spectra and each waveband has merits and drawbacks over the other waveband. Polaris Sensor Technologies, Inc in a phase I effort designed a two color MWIR/LWIR wide format (860x480 pixel) imaging polarimeter. The system will collect simultaneous spatially and temporally coherent images of polarization in the MWIR and LWIR. In a single frame period, it collects four images: two polarized MWIR images and two polarized LWIR images. The system can alternately collect s1 or s2 Stokes images at 120 frames per second, or s1 and s2 at 60 frames per second. The system is designed utilizing COTS optical components, polarization optics and FPAs. All of the subsystems and components were demonstrated in Phase I and because of the Phase I work, the Phase II build/calibrate/test effort is considered very low risk.",

As a result, these windows will better manage solar heat gain by switching between infrared transmittance and reflectivity. The ultimate objective is to develop skylights, windows, and roofs that adapt to seasonal, regional, and diurnal changes in solar flux and heating and cooling requirements. These window modules change the optical properties of surfaces by moving pigment from a small area reservoir to full surface coverage in a similar manner to the way squids change their skin color. The Phase I program developed pigmented fluids with engineering infrared responses, and demonstrated proof-of-concept functioning devices operating with these fluids. The Phase II project will develop the designs, processing strategies, and materials for full smart windows modules. Windows modules will then be built, measured, and directly compared with status quo windows. The innovation in this work is the development and realization of entirely new materials and devices for managing near-infrared light over a large surface area. The broader impact/commercial potential of this smart window technology is empowering buildings to actively manage solar heat gain to improve energy efficiency, which is a truly green solution. U.S. building energy consumption (40% of total U.S. Energy Consumption) can be reduced significantly with smart windows and smart skylights that maximize sunlight for lighting, while effectively managing solar heat gain, including near-infrared energy. Current passive technologies for windows do not readily adapt to seasonal, regional, and diurnal changes in solar flux and heating and cooling requirements. By empowering buildings to adapt solar heat gain to daily local needs, U.S. energy consumption could be reduced by as much as one quadrillion BTU per year, while adding minimal cost to building infrastructure.

CRG worked to define and expand the SMP fastener design toolbox through mechanical performance evaluations conducted throughout the prescribed operational temperature range.  The results identified consistent thermally activated and deactivated performance throughout the various tensile, shear, and cleavage peel evaluations.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  MZA partnered with Kratos/DFI proposes development, optimization, subscale wind tunnel testing/validation, and target engagement simulations for an aircraft pod with forward and aft-looking laser beam directors employing integrated flow control.  Using CFD simulations, we will consider both unsteady forces as well as wake properties when flow control is included on the aft section of the pod.  We will validate the predictions of our flow control modeling in a subscale wind tunnel test conducted in the Trisonic Gasdynamic Facility (TGF.)  We will make measurements of unsteady pressure/forces on the pod and collect diagnostics on the wake flow.  These diagnostics will be compared to CFD predictions for a full-scale system, and for the subscale system as tested in the TGF.  We will design a beam control solution which handles laser propagation through the pod to either the forward or aft-looking turret.  We will conduct FEM analysis with unsteady CFD forces to quantify aero-mechanical jitter and higher-order aberrations in the optical system.  Our CFD/FEM/wave-optics simulation software framework will be enhanced.  Our simulations will demonstrate how aft flow control will improve overall system effectiveness.  Dr. Matthew Whiteley will be Principal Investigator for MZA and Dr. William Coirier will be lead for Kratos/DFI.  BENEFIT:  Integration of laser projection turrets onto transonic and hypersonic airframes presents a new and challenging environment for laser directed energy weapons.  Integration approaches used previously for laser weapons have generally involved substantial changes to the airframe and internal payload of the aircraft.  The laser pod being developed in the proposed effort allows for a self-contained modular system which may be mated with multiple aircraft platforms when needed to perform certain missions.  The laser pod has beam directors forward and aft, thus opening up the field-of-regard for the laser weapon.  In Phase II we are developing a flow control solution which will improve the quality of laser propagation and beam control from the laser pod aft beam director.  Flow control will also improve the wake characteristics of the pod to avoid interference with the aircraft itself.  Performance improvement with flow control will be quantified with high-fidelity modeling and validated against subscale testing, providing an attractive technology readiness level (TRL) for larger system integrators looking for innovative solutions for use in future aircraft laser weapon system modules.  The flow control technology developed here can also be adapted for modification of existing aircraft pods which find ubiquitous applications in aircraft armament and sensors.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The ultimate goal of this proposed effort is to improve the ability of onboard software to predict trajectories of other aircraft in the terminal area of operations.  This ability can only be realized with an automatic capability for recognizing the intent of the pilots of these other aircraft in the complex and dynamic terminal area.  The Phase I prototype absolutely proved the feasibility of using procedure and dialog graphs, fractional dialog grammars and Behavior Transition Networks for ground trajectory prediction, by actually implementing them in software and demonstrating them with actual air traffic control transcripts and simulated sensor data.    The next logical step, as addressed by this proposal, is to develop the full-scale Intelligent Pilot Intent Analysis System (IPIAS) to support autonomous UAV ground operations and integrate it to the degree possible with the appropriate UAV systems currently being developed.  The Phase II IPIAS will analyze text recognized from actual airport ATC-Pilot communications and simulated sensor data to predict routes on the ground for aircraft on the ground, taking off, and landing.  We will coordinate with sibling contractors and the selected prime through early and frequent contact to ensure full understanding of the evolving requirements, constraints, opportunities, and integration issues.     BENEFIT:  The direct target for this effort is UASs operating in the terminal area of operations (TAO).  The primary commercialization plan for IPIAS relative to this domain will be to demonstrate a significant potential for automatic, intelligent pilot intent recognition, thus improving safety related to UASs in the TAO with reduced manning in Phase II.  This will allow us to acquire Phase III funding to transition IPIAS to operational use.  The realization of this capability will create a demand for similar systems for other agencies (i.e. the Army, Navy, and Marines) since they all have UASs.  Additionally, the Department of Homeland Security and the Drug Enforcement Agency have the similar problem of a growing number of UASs, and the desire to operate them in the TAO.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Phase I results have demonstrated the feasibility of the Veracity Evaluation of non-Redundant Information in Flight sYstems (VERIFY) technology through simulations and flight tests in the case of different sensor failures. In each case an appropriate Fault Detection, Identification and Accommodation (FDIA) scheme was developed, along with confidence measure calculation. Continuing development, integration, implementation and extensive simulation and hardware testing of the VERIFY system will result in a comprehensive software-based FDIA system, which also predicts sensor degradation trends, and generates associated confidence measures.  BENEFIT:  This project will result in the development, implementation and testing of a software module which provides integrity management for single-thread sensors. The modularity of the software architecture allows the user to apply the developed algorithms to different sensor types. The applications of such a modular integrity management system are tremendous, since unmanned systems are taking a greater role in long-term planning in Air Force and other DoD branches. Unmanned systems such as UAVs, USVs and UGVs are envisioned to be capable of autonomous decision-making, self-determination and self-assessment. Such autonomous systems will greatly benefit from an integrity management system such as VERIFY to determine the health status of non-redundant subsystems, and integrate this information with the overall integrated vehicle health management system.    In addition to military applications, automobile industry can hugely benefit from such technology. Future automobiles will be equipped with sensors that provide situational awareness to drivers such as front and rear collision sensors. Such capabilities typically require single thread sensing elements that are utilized as input to a critical system such as the breaking system. Effective FDIA also has a very large payoff in quality control, wherein down-time due to failures is costly. In addition, otherwise healthy sensors are often unnecessarily replaced during scheduled periodic maintenance.  VERIFY&#039;s ability to perform FDIA and more advanced data corroboration across other weakly   correlated sensors (WCS) can reduce maintenance costs.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  In this effort, we will couple the energy of focused microwave bursts into the air and onto surfaces by first forming a laser plasma. The presence of the laser plasma allows much lower microwave intensities to couple their energy to the laser-pre-ionized surface or air- volume, allowing more efficient energy-transfer and the use of lower-power microwave systems to achieve the desired effect. We will use a variety of laser pulses, including ultrashort laser pulses, which can achieve the intensities required to seed surfaces and air, even with very little energy per pulse. This is a direct result of their short pulse width, and will allow very low average laser-power as the seed, relying on the more cost- effective microwave source for the bulk of the energy deposition. For this Phase II effort, we will build upon our promising Phase I results, to develop and demonstrate a laser-microwave system capable of coupling the energy of focused microwave bursts into quiescent air without the need for a microwave cavity, resulting in configuration much more applicable for improving performance of high speed vehicles. We will demonstrate the capability of our laser-microwave system at various pressure ranges experienced by high speed vehicles.  BENEFIT:  The benefits of this technology will increase control and performance on high speed air platforms, including military and civilian aircraft, as well as unmanned systems (including missiles and re-entry vehicles), and space access and re-entry craft. The potential absence of moving parts in the resulting control effectors stand to dramatically improve cost, risk, performance, and longevity.",

A significant limitation of conventional SKE signals is that they are detectable at long distances by adversaries. Passive detection schemes that employ infrared and thermal cameras, electro-optic and acoustic sensors are of interest for future SKE upgrades although they lack the capability to provide sufficiently accurate relative positioning over long ranges. To overcome these problems, we propose a terahertz (THz) relative positioning system to enable formation station keeping for large transport aircraft. In contrast with current generation SKE, our system will be essentially invisible to ground or air-based surveillance.  This system will function in all weather conditions, including cloud cover and precipitation. Unlike GPS-based systems, our THz positioning system will be effectively impossible to spoof or jam. System accuracy will be more than sufficient to meet the stated requirement (500 feet longitudinal and 200 feet lateral).

        "abstract": "Satellite RF components suffer from an additional design limitation that does not concern their terrestrial counterparts: multipaction, an electron avalanche effect that can reduce performance or permanently damage devices under certain conditions. To avoid the onset of this effect, the traditional options are increasing the component size (more specifically, gap widths) or reducing operating power. Given the cost per weight to deploy satellite systems, both of these options result in exponential increases in the price per watt of transmission. In the Phase I, Nokomis demonstrated the potential of a new approach to multipactor mitigation for the development of multipactor-resistant components that allow for increased power handling and performance with improved reliability.   In the Phase II, Nokomis will build and test components enhanced with the mitigation technology at high power under vacuum and compare them to otherwise identical unenhanced components to assess their relative multipactor susceptibility and demonstrate the value of the coating technology. Based on Phase I results, it is expected that the enhancement effects of the coatings will allow for increases of more than an order of magnitude in power handling without reducing performance.",

Because of ambiguities associated with entities, these data stores become filled with redundant statements, preventing Warfighters from finding everything known about specific entities rapidly and accurately. To address this requirement, DAC is partnering with Cobham (formerly SPARTA) to bring together best-of-breed technologies for entity disambiguation and conflict resolution. READ provides Entity and Relationship Co-Reference Resolution, RDF Conflict Identification and Resolution, and improved RDF Schema for Context Storage. These capabilities will provide intelligence analysts the necessary tools to rapidly and accurately obtain all of the necessary information about specific entities.

        "abstract": "The use of monolithic airfoil structures in static and rotating components such as one-piece integrally bladed rotors (IBR&#039;&#039;s) in military turbine engines has created an increased risk of high cycle fatigue(HCF). The Phase I and Phase II SBIR efforts demonstrated that plasma sprayed ceramic coatings infiltrated with viscoelastic (VEM) polymers exhibited over six times the damping of typical plasma sprayed damping coatings at low dynamic strains and close to twice the damping at higher strains. Elevated temperature (200 to 400\u00b0F) spin pit and fatigue tests were conducted with no indication of macro creep of the VEM. It was observed that there was about a 10% decrease in the fatigue strength of the coated specimens as compared to the bare specimens. However, due to the increase in damping it is believed that this is very acceptable. The Phase II expansion research studies will allow for improvements to the plasma spray coating cell, continued plasma spraying studies to optimize coating process, the development of application methods necessary to apply the plasma sprayed damping coatings to a variety of aircraft engine airfoil configurations, and the evaluation of optimized plasma sprayed damping coatings on airfoils and blisks to determine the coating parameters, such as coating thickness, location, and surface finish to satisfactorily provide the necessary damping,engine performance and structural durability.",

Furthermore, the same technology offers exciting possibilities for use on a wide variety challenging surfaces, some of which could enable new designs, capabilities, and production methods suitable for future systems. Rapid transition of this technology into legacy platforms is ensured since only traditional processing methods are employed, many aspects of this technology are already commercial, and we will first seek to supplant legacy products before attempting to insert this technology into new applications.

Constructing suitable, game-based, culturally relevant scenarios to prepare soldiers for effective communication is difficult, time-consuming, and expensive. Authoring By Cultural Demonstration (ABCD) is an innovative combination of cognitive science, technology, and COTS scenario-authoring tools that that enables warfighters and instructors to author culturally relevant training scenarios in a game-engine agnostic environment. A key innovation in ABCD is the division of authoring into several components: (1) machinima tools to enable input of real events to support generation of a single non-interactive plot script, output as machinima; (2) interaction tools to specify interaction choices and consequences, resulting in an interactive scenario; (3)  contrasting cases tools to ensure scenarios revolve around key training principles in the form of interaction patterns; and (4) an asset library that provides culturally relevant physical locations, avatars, props, etc.. Separating the authoring process into these pieces allows existing tools, such as AI-based cinematography, conventional video editing, and radial-category-oriented stimulus and response creation, to be brought to bear on the task. The net result is a quick, easy, and nontechnical solution.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Collecting information in an urban environment is done in non-combat operations on a daily basis by local law enforcement by officers walking the beat.  Officers are present on our streets.  Officers become familiar with areas of the city by constantly understanding and interpreting what they see on a daily basis.  A system that can perform this same mission in evolving urban conflicts, while directly removing them from missions that can be accomplished without unnecessary human participation, will significantly reduce the amount of casualties incurred. This system will remove soldiers from harms way but will allow them to continue to gather valuable intelligence.  With this in mind, we propose a Small Unmanned Aerial System based on the Skate SUAS platform by Aurora Flight Sciences. Skate will begin the mission from a base station that is stationed in a known location.  Skate will takeoff autonomously from the base station and fly a pre-planned mission through an urban environment, collecting surveillance data.  Skates design will allow the airframe to autonomously hook a wire and hang inverted using its gimbaled camera to provide real time video.  This beat cop mission will provide valuable ISR information and remove soldiers from harms way.  BENEFIT:  The main benefit of the proposed research is to provide a near-term technologically feasible approach to the Urban Beat Cop mission as identified as a need by AFRL and OSD.  Through the effective maturation and development of these key identified features and technologies the Skate System will be able to satisfy a new type of mission that many War fighters are encountering throughout the world in the various campaigns the united states is currently engaged in.  In addition to marketing the UBC Skate System to the US military this type of system with its extreme amount of autonomy and repetitive nature would be valuable to many domestic law enforcement teams that have the need for routine and repetitive surveillance where an autonomous asset may be capable of performing this mission better than personnel.  In addition to the law enforcement community there are places in the border security and general security markets.  Aurora has received interest from the department of homeland security for this type of asset and would be very interested when the system is able to be demonstrated.    The United States also has the challenge of secures its infrastructure of railways and shipping lanes and the UBC Skate may be an ideal platform for patrolling those type of maintenance facilities in an inexpensive way.    The UBC enabled Skate platform is also an ideal way for the US to provide embassy security and surveillance in foreign and hostile countries.    Aurora employs a full time business development staff and will utilize them to socialize these features within our current product base and customer base to fully explore the corners of the market as far as commercialization potential is concerned with the Skate UBC platform.",

The Spectra Research team proposes an integrated device consisting of an RF Tag, IR/E-O Tag and RF wakeup/trigger receiver. This device will provide responses to corresponding sensors on friendly aircraft. Missions for which the DMT will be investigated include Strike, CAS, ISR and CSAR. The design goal for the DMT is a device which can simultaneously respond to any RF or IR/E-O sensor and provide Combat Identification (CID) to any or all of the respective sensors in an innovative, compact system. Maximum use will be made of Spectra Research&quot;s proven RF Tag and RF receiver technology, combined with new concepts in the IR/E-O Tag arena, particularly IR Markers. IR/E-O aircraft sensors under consideration include not only standalone FLIRS, but also pods with integrated FLIR, laser range finder, designators, pointers and TV.  BENEFIT:  Spectra Research&quot;s commercialization strategy will capitalize on the growing demand for miniaturized RF/EO-IR transmitters for tracking soldiers on the battlefield and civilian uses such as firefighters or law enforcement officials. Animals also require long term tracking, with identification, such as in National Parks, State Parks and for University-level research in animal behavior.

The goals of this collaborative effort are to provide a mutually beneficial research and commercialization platform where SBIR/STTR Phase II grantees can perform collaborative research with ERC faculty, researchers, and graduate students, to strengthen the capacity of their firms, and/or speed the transition of ERC advances to the marketplace. In accordance with the NSF solicitation NSF 10-617, PICOCAL, Inc has submitted a request for additional funding. The sub-awardee identified in the request is the University of Michigan. This proposal/request meets the requirements of the solicitation NSF 10-023. The proposed collaboration leverages and extends the work from PICOCALs Phase II (SBIR Phase II Award Id: 0822810) and the Engineering Research Center (ERC) for Wireless Integrated Microsystems grants. PICOCAL would be leveraging technology developed during its NSF SBIR Phase II in order to grow individual nanostructures while controlling their dimensions and orientation. During its Phase II effort, a vacuum scanning system was developed to provide nanometer positioning accuracy and accommodate specialized scanning thermal probes and probe arrays. From the ERC&#039;s side, the on-going research in the AMPP (advanced materials, processes, and packaging) thrust is relevant to the manufacturing of probes that can operate at elevated temperatures and in chemically reactive environments. This proposal provides an opportunity for the small business (PICOCAL) and the ERC (WIMS) to work synergistically together to develop a manufacturing technology for carbon nanotubes (CNT) that would have control over location, size, shape, and orientation not currently possible by other commercial methods. The SBIR Phase II to PICOCAL developed a specialized vacuum scanning system to allow nanometer accuracy when using scanning thermal probes and probe arrays. The ERC provides advanced materials expertise and additional expertise in scanning probes that will be important to the extension of the Phase II technology. The proposed collaboration will extend the Phase II technologies and translate this technology into the marketplace more rapidly. The proposed work, if successful, can have broad applications across a number of fields, including health care, energy systems, and environmental monitoring. The use of nanoprobes to control the growth and orientation of nanostructures can have a tremendous effect on nanotechnology and is something that will be synergistic with research now being pursued in the WIMS Engineering Research Center. The expected deliverables from this work include an improved probe tip, and improved probe wear. The proposed activity also helps broaden the participation underrepresented groups.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Advanced space-borne infrared detectors require cooling in the 10 to 20 K temperature range.  Cooling loads will be approximately 0.25 W to 1.0 W for the detectors, with additional loads at higher temperatures for other subsystems.  A multistage cooler, capable of providing refrigeration at more than one temperature simultaneously, can provide the greatest system efficiency and lowest mass.  Turbomachine-based Brayton cryocoolers are ideal candidates for these applications because they are highly efficient, lightweight, vibration-free, multistage compatible, and have long maintenance-free lifetimes.  Creare has developed state-of-the-art components needed to create turbo-Brayton cryocoolers for these missions.  During the current program, we propose to integrate these components to form a two-stage cryocooler that provides refrigeration in the 10 to 20 K temperature range.  During the Phase I project, we obtained key operational and performance data for the cold-stage turboalternator.  During the Phase II project, we plan to assemble a brassboard cryocooler, measure its performance at cold load temperatures as low as 10 K, and use the results to develop a preliminary design for a fully optimized cryocooler.  BENEFIT:  The successful completion of this program will demonstrate a two-stage turbo-Brayton cryocooler that operates in the 10-20 K temperature range.  This type of cryocooler is ideal for cooling applications in space-based surveillance and missile-defense systems.  Government-funded scientific applications include space-based infrared telescopes. Commercial applications include communication satellites, superconducting instruments, hypercomputers, and Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices (SQUIDs).",

        "abstract": "Future Air ASW will be conducted at higher altitudes, making visual, Mark-On-Top and RF techniques less accurate for receiver localization. Alternatives such as installing GPS receivers in the sonobuoys suffer from high cost or are easily jammed. Recent news reports concerning North Korea&quot;s jamming of joint US-South Korea military exercises highlights the vulnerability of our defense systems to GPS denial, and makes it critical to find alternate solutions that do not rely on GPS. What is needed are techniques that can provide buoy and target localization using acoustic information. Traditional acoustic stabilization techniques typically update only the relative geometry of the sensor field. Absolute positions depend on initial drop accuracy which at high altitudes is going to be challenging. Field ocean currents will also introduce errors that traditional acoustic buoy stabilization techniques cannot overcome. Signal Systems Corporation is developing a new and innovative acoustic approach of buoy and target localization to provide absolute target geo-location without visual, RF or GPS inputs. In Phase I we accomplished our basic algorithm development and using real at-sea data and bathymetry data demonstrated that our approach has merit. Phase II will focus on bringing this technology to Technology Readiness Level 6.",

        "abstract": "Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) currently deployed on the battlefield are driven with Operator Control Units (e.g., joystick or point-and-click interface), which requires the full attention of an operator. This means the operator cannot concentrate on maintaining situational awareness, security, or other tasks. To reduce the burden on the operator, SoarTech with our partners Thinking Robots, Brown University, and Southwest Research Institute propose to develop a natural dialogue interface for interacting with UGVs, where an operator can interact with a UGV using speech and gesture. The UGV will be capable of taking high-level commands, engaging in dialogue with the user to ensure that the command is clear and providing feedback to the user during task execution. To accomplish this, we will develop a multi-modal Smart Interaction Device (SID) for UGV control, based on a proven Intelligent User Interface system that we have used for supervisory control of tactical simulation entities. We will extend our Phase I work to focus on gestures and speech for interacting with UGVs during Logistics Connector missions, and implement this on a target ONR platform. This approach will enable natural, supervisory control of one or more UGVs, and greatly reduce the workload of the UGV operator.",

The results indicated that the degree of mixing required to match those of the existing laboratory setup will require a high shear mixer on the proposed automated system.

We will perform hierarchical AiTR based on probabilistic feature extraction for the GFE SAS data. We will combine evidence using multiple extracted features to perform the hierarchical target identification.

        "abstract": "The primary technical objective to be achieved during Phase II is the transition from the developed laboratory prototype, which clearly demonstrated the feasibility and superior outcomes of the approach, to a deployable system consisting of two key elements (the reference station - compression side and the rover - expansion side) and packaging them into a form suitable for commercial sales to early adopters. This will be demonstrated in three different operational test environments (over three delivery media types) and is expected to subsequently lead to an early revenue stream supporting similar deployments as well as other related market opportunities. The commercialization section contains further details relating to these anticipated early markets.\n\nExpected Results:\nThe results of the Phase I effort resulted in a working system, but one which was implemented using Matlab (an expensive mathematical modeling tool not suitable for deployment use) and Windows based PCs. This system also used prior saved \u201cRINEX\u201d data; it did not operate on the real time \u201cNtrip\u201d data which is now widely available. A large part of the technical objectives in this phase deals with the process of transitioning the work into a real-time production environment suitable for a deployable system. This effort represents most of the labor (~78%) and roughly ~53% of the direct use of funds in the program.\n\nSuitable tasks in Phase II also support the filing of two patent applications discovered during the Phase I work effort which are needed to protect the invention (~14% of funds). A minor outreach and marketing task (mostly to key standard developing organizations who have an interest in this work) is combined with the support for the actual field demonstrations to begin developing commercial awareness of the product (~8%).\n\nThese objectives will result in a demonstrated system which can be used to show the benefit of the research embodied into a suitable product offering, as well as providing early interactions with key identified potential customers. While significant further commercial development will remain ahead, the two core products (rover side and compression side devices) are expected to be advanced to the point when early sales and support for a permanent base of users can begin. In a related path, the developed message sets should then be in the process of committee review in various key standards groups, a technical objective needed for widespread adoption. While we do anticipate a need for Phase IIb funding, this is expected to be largely offset by the projected income of these early adopters as they begin to integrate the technology into their own products.",

The ICP technology is unique as it quantitatively captures critical properties such as residual stresses, linear and non-linear elastic properties and substrate-interactions. The technology also enables observation of&quot;coating creation&quot;with concomitant implications on application, performance and reliability. It has the potential to transform the thermal spray industry in its coating specification, design and processing strategy. ReliaCoat&quot;s principle goal is to demonstrate the applicability of the ICP technology to industrial users and DoD maintenance facilities, and provide a framework of cross-correlations with current post-spray method of coating property evaluation. A further goal is to link in-situ derived data with component level coating characteristics through simulated experiments and models. ReliaCoat shall deliver to Tinker AFB a robust, booth level coating monitoring tool, enabling improved assessment of coating specifications and quality control as well as process variability .  BENEFIT:  Thermal spray coatings are widely used by original equipment manufacturer, and suppliers for repair and overhaul of turbine engine components used in propulsion and energy generation. Wide ranging coatings from thermal barriers for heat shielding to wear resistance coatings are used by both US military and civilian turbine industry and as such represents as multi-billion dollar industry. These coatings perform important functions that enhance the efficiency, safety, reliability and operational cost of advanced turbine engines. Knowledge, tools and technologies that aid in enhanced understanding of the coating generation and improved methods of coating characterization and that too in real time within the spray environment will offer significant benefits from both performance and manufacturing points-of-view.

        "abstract": "This Phase II SBIR project will develop a full color, 720P, wide field of view (90), see-through head mounted display (HMD) prototype based on Innovegas eyeborne optic concept.  This new eyewear architecture is a radical departure from traditional near eye displays.  Rather than presenting the eye with collimated rays of light that appear to originate from a distant source, the performance of the eye is enhanced by sophisticated contact lenses to enable short focal length accommodation of non-collimated light rays.  The special contact lenses add one additional focal accommodation distance to the wearers normal vision.  This is done with no impact to the wearers normal sight other than a slight attenuation of ambient brightness. The result is that the eye is able to observe the near-eye imagery over its full field of view while simultaneously observing the surrounding environment.  This eliminates all imaging optics from the eyewear resulting in a compact see-thru display.  The HMD prototype will utilize an LCOS projector module to create an image directly onto the HMD spectacle lenses.  In addition to making the LCOS projection HMD, research will be put into developing improved nano-wire polarizer and spectral filter fabrication processes for integration into contact lenses.",

With the advantages obtained by use of the holographic waveguide and the small LCOS microdisplay, the proposed HWVD system will enable significant cost, volume, and weight reductions as compared to existing CRT type designs.  The design will also address power and efficiency requirements consistent with a pilot HMD system.  Use of an LED light source will allow for utilization of specific wavelengths tailored to specific applications, and allow for high brightness requirements. Using the holographic waveguide development plan, the the path towards a full color,high resolution HWVD with a panoramic 120 x 80 degree FOV will be demonstrated.  A second visor with a curved waveguide will be developed.  BENEFIT:  A modular concept is proposed for a binocular helmet mounted display system with holographic waveguide and high-resolution LCOS technology. These technologies will be combined with a unique optics design for achieving high levels of brightness and contrast ratio.  This  will dramatically improve the HMD quality for both  military and commercial aircraft. The modularity of the mechanical concept will enable the support of multiple platforms and application with only one basic design. Accumulated knowledge during this effort will enable us to adjust rapidly to a variety of unique military and commercial display applications and expand the market.",

Low-observability or camouflaging by reducing the heat or IR signature can reduce enemy intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaisance of friendly base camps. This can be accomplished by achieving two goals: hiding both heating and cooling of base camp interiors and matching the surface properties (such as emissivity and solar absorptivity ) of the base camp to the surrounding environment. A passive system comprised of two elements can achieve and maintain IR low observability or camouflaging. The first component uses a light-weight, low stowed volume, packageable insulation which hides interior heating and cooling. The second component is customization of the surface material properties of the base camp to match the surrounding environment which LGarde has accomplished in the past for different applications to achieve IR low observability. This system can be integrated into the primary surfaces of the tents or can be retrofitted to existing tents. High strength material will also be incorporated into the system.",

        "abstract": "Under battlefield conditions, warfighters face a wide range of cutaneous injuries, many of which are susceptible to life- and limb-threatening infections caused by multi-drug resistant bacteria.  Nitric oxide is a powerful, broad spectrum antimicrobial agent that is naturally produced by the immune system.  Nitric oxide&quot;s ability to attack multiple cellular targets limits the chance for bacteria to develop resistance to it.  The use of nitric oxide to treat infections has been hindered by the challenges associated with chemically storing the gas into a solid state and controlling its release.     Novan&quot;s nitric oxide-releasing silica technology, Nitricil, overcomes the past issues with nitric oxide-based therapeutics because it effectively stores large quantities of nitric oxide gas and allows the release to be&quot;tuned&quot;for use in acute trauma scenarios or longer term wound care applications.  The technical innovation and flexibility of Nitricil clearly separates it from all other nitric oxide storage scaffolds.

A volumetric source such as the DRA, as opposed to a printed planar or a wire source, inherently provides higher bandwidths. In the Phase I program, multimode DRA designs covering UHF, L-band, and GPS L1 and L2 bands were completed. Two types of L-band 960-1220 MHz Omni Tx/Rx antennas were prototyped and results were presented. The objective of the proposed Phase II effort is to extend the Phase I investigations to develop a single antenna structure that supports several bands with different modes of operation.

The approach is to bring together nanostructures in a polypropylene matrix to form a novel nanocomposite material with high effective dielectric constant, high breakdown voltage, and low dissipation factor. In Phase I we successfully produced a nanocomposite dielectric material by uniformly dispersing chemically modified ferroelectric nanoparticles into a polypropylene (PP) matrix to form a novel material with high effective dielectric constant and high energy density for capacitor applications. This high nanoparticle content film exhibits a charged energy density of 6.85 J/cm3, a dielectric constant of 31.97, and breakdown voltage of 220 MV/m. This combination of high energy density and high dielectric constant has not been attained previously from either commercial PP or PP nanocomposites dielectric films.

Existing technologies have been unable to efficiently capture this energy in a cost-effective manner. This project entails hydraulic and electronic model optimization, design of vehicle-ready prototypes, fabrication, lab testing, installation, and operational testing of a hydraulic adaptive damping energy harvesting system. The objective of the project is to demonstrate real-world benefits of an efficient, adjustable damping regenerative shock absorber on a transit bus in operation with a municipal transit agency. Emphasis will be on efficiency improvements, semi-active ride control, and application specific integration requirements to ensure seamless installation and operation.

Effectively incorporating an aftermarket or OEM retrofit-able regenerative energy capture system may open doors to many new regenerative technologies in the transportation and automotive sector, facilitating significant reductions in waste energy.

UHT ceramics are often challenging to densify. The development of UHT microwave assist technology (MAT) furnaces will dramatically improve the commercial applicability of UHT ceramic products through lower temperature densification and faster heating cycles. MAT, the combination of microwaves with radiant heat, is proven to enhance diffusion, leading to finer grained microstructures. This project will extend the use of MAT to temperatures above 1700 deg. C, into the range of sintering temperatures for UHT ceramics. A prototype UHT MAT furnace will be designed and built, capitalizing upon in-house MAT system design expertise and research results from Phase I. Proprietary MAT-modeling software will assist with optimizing furnace design and process efficiency. Selected UHT ceramics will be studied to demonstrate sintering with the prototype. Three current industrial UHT ceramic manufacturers, who expressed strong interest in using MAT for sintering products, will collaborate on the project. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes performance enhancements at reduced processing costs, and growth in the use of ultrahigh temperature (UHT) ceramics. Expanded uptake of UHT ceramics will benefit a wide array of manufactured products in electronics, automotive, and aerospace applications. The process of sintering UHT ceramics is extremely energy-intensive. UHT microwave-assist technology (MAT) processing will reduce energy consumption and green house gas emissions by 50-80% for UHT ceramic production. This process may replace pressure-assisted methods, by combining MAT with techniques such as variable rate sintering. MAT may also decrease the use of sintering aids to improve erosion and wear resistance, and high-temperature strength. This faster process enables just-in-time manufacture and enhances competition with respect to foreign competitors. Finally, the UHT MAT furnace technology will lead to new and value-added products, through property improvements from finer grain sizes and cost reduction.

Two areas of study are planned. The first is to improve optical quality, particularly homogeneity of refractive index and absence of stress birefringence, voids, bubbles and inclusions. The second is to improve mechanical strength for greater durability. Technology Assessment &amp; Transfer (TA &amp; T) works primarily with magnesium aluminate spinel and has developed the capability to produce large plates of transparent spinel by hot pressing. Spinel offers superior transmission characteristics for IR sensors and has a cost advantage compared to competing transparent ceramic materials such as sapphire and AlON.",

We are currently reaching a tipping point in history concerning data: more data is being manufactured by machines, servers, mobile devices, and software applications than by people. We must develop standards, schemas, and processes for organizing and manipulating this data so its relevant to the user. On this project we well develop an RDF ontology for mapping the air force data network and also investigate a framework for deploying mobile apps that are operating system independent. This technology will allow government software teams to build these applications one time and deploy to any mobile device connected to their networks.  BENEFIT:  Decision making and the process utilized for making the best decisions possible, the quality or strength of any decision is in direct correlation to the data or information used to make those critical decisions. This project will provide the DoD/AF the ability to search and&quot;mashup&quot;every type of information on their networks and delivered through mobile devices.",

Intelligent Automation, Inc. (IAI) is developing a Model driven Data Mining System for studying Environmental Impact of Nanomaterials, NEIMiner, which consists of four components. The NEI modeling framework defines the scope of NEI modeling and the strategy of integrating NEI models to form a layered, comprehensive predictability similar to the Framework for Risk Analysis of Multi-Media Environmental Systems (FRAMES). The data integration layer brings together heterogeneous data sources related to NEI via automatic web services and web scraping technologies. The data management and access layer reuses and extends a popular Content Management System (CMS), Drupal, and consists of modules that model and enable interactions over a complex data structure for NEI related bibliography and characterization data.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Functional Kill of buildings and below-ground structures is becoming an increasing area of concern for war fighters.  Functional Kill refers to defeating a building by rendering it or its contents (infrastructure) functionally incapable of performing the overall mission for which the building was designed.  AFRL/RWPL is seeking innovative methods to accomplish modeling of Functional Kill.  ACTA proposes to develop several innovative methods for modeling building infrastructure within the Smart Target Model Generator (STMG) and to develop and validate HFPB Fast Running Models (FRM&quot;s) for predicting the probable effects from munitions effects on the functionality of building infrastructure components.  Finally, ACTA and its subcontract, ARA, will integrate the FRM&quot;s within the enhanced STMG/MEVA framework.  BENEFIT:  Numerous government agencies, all military branches, and the majority of industry are required to estimate risks and maximum probable loss to buildings and facilities and their infrastructure arising from terrorist threats and accidental explosions.  Existing methodologies for infrastructure vulnerability are few, largely heuristic, and do not account for uncertainty.  Most demonstrated consequence models require extremely long run times and are unsuitable outside a research context.  The development of HFPB Fast Running Models for predicting the probable effects of munitions on building infrastructure will remedy this widespread need.  Integration of these FRM&quot;s within STMG/MEVA will provide AFRL/RWPL with a greatly enhanced ability to assess functional kill under different scenarios, accounting for uncertainty.  Availability of infrastructure component models, including distributed infrastructure, based on a modern paradigm will also greatly improve the ability of planners to mitigate potential threats and to address mission needs.",

        "abstract": "Presently U.S. Army is intersted in developing metal nano-coated graphite (carbon) micro/nanofibers that can be used for infrared threat sensor countermeasures and other military applications, because they are excellent attenuators in the infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The metal nano-coatings around carbon micro/nanofibers are desired to have high electrical conductivity, be with the thickness less than 100 nm, and simultaneously can be produced at a low cost. However, there is not a cost-effective processing method available that is capable of depositing a metal nano-coating meeting the above characteristics. In this SBIR project, Aegis Technology proposes to develop a cost-effective, scalable coating process capable of producing highly conductive metal nano-coating for carbon micro/nanofibers. In the accomplished Phase I, Aegis has successfully demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed approach, identified the direction for further improvement and optimization. Based upon the findings and success of the Phase I, in this the Phase II project, Aegis will: (1) fully develop and demonstrate a novel metal nano-coating technology and the resultant highly conductive metal-coated carbon micro/nanofibers including carbon nanotubes; (2) further identify the underlying technical issues that govern the fabrication and performance of the metal nano-coated carbon micro/nanofibers and address the technical issues related with process optimizations and scaling up; (3) use this knowledge to produce metal nano-coated carbon micro/nanofibers with excellent extinction coefficient in infrared frequencies as required by Army; and (4) implement technology transfer for potential mass production. In addition, we will also address the issues related with dispersion, packing and dissemination of metal nano-coated carbon micro/nanofibers, which are essential to transfer this technology into potential field tests and subsequent military applications.",

Batteries, e.g. lead acid batteries, are beginning to be used in some applications.

        "abstract": "A central challenge for U.S. forces is anticipating how foreign populations may respond to activities or incidents (e.g., military actions, natural disaster, psychological operations campaigns). Unfortunately, natural changes of attitudes and opinions within a particular population complicate our efforts to assess their opinions and possible reactions to different courses of action. To address this difficulty, Aptima proposes to develop FACETS (Forecasting Activities through Cultural, Epidemiological, and Temporal Semantics). FACETS will provide military planners the capability to forecast shifts in opinion over time within a population of interest. These types of tools have traditionally relied on surveys and censuses, which are accurate but costly, time-consuming, and time sensitive. To compensate for these shortcomings, Aptima will apply natural language processing techniques to extract relevant events, topics, and opinions from population-authored data (e.g., internet news, blogs, and social media). These data will then be used to simulate reactions to current events within the agent-based model, thereby extending the useful life of survey-based analyses. FACETS will then incorporate the mathematics of epidemiology to determine how information spreads within the population. Aptima&quot;s approach takes advantage of often under-utilized data sources to more accurately and efficiently determine whether we are winning the battle of&quot;hearts and minds.&quot;",

The technical objective of this research is to design new concept Towed Array Handler System primary units, namely a capstan and interdependent stowage reel, and then test scaled prototypes of these primary units to assure their positive dynamic interaction with the array. Our technical objectives will consider every operating unit or component in terms of how reliability or life can be improved and how cost or weight can be reduced. Array life, hardware cost, minimal ship impact, installation cost and maintenance are the prime determinants of our New Era Towed Array Handler (NETAH) concept direction.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to develop the next generation of atom chips for producing and manipulating ultracold atomic gases (temperatures&lt;1\u00b5K). While atom chips developed in Phase I provided only magnetic control, these new hybrid atom chips will be able to manipulate ultracold matter both magnetically and optically. These chips will be incorporated into atom-chip vacuum cells, allowing optical techniques to be implemented in compactultracold matter products. In Phase I, we developed silicon/glass wafers for both creating ultrahigh vacuum electrical feedthroughs with near perfect yield as well as in-trap imaging of ultracold matter. In Phase II, we will further develop this technology by incorporating miniature on-chip opticalelements as a vehicle for bringing optical potentials (e.g. produced by laser beams) into the vacuum system. Our research plan includes redesigning existing chip layouts to accommodate small-sized optics that will be anodically bonded to silicon regions of the chip. To further enhance functionality,we will pursue both anti-reflection coating of atom chips and redesigns of the connectorization scheme used to bring electrical currents to the chip. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to greatly expand the number and variety of experimental techniques that can be implemented with atom-chip vacuum cells. Of key interest here are optical techniques, such as optical lattices, used to trap and coherently control quantum mechanical systems (e.g. Bose-Einstein condensates). An important application of ultracold lattice-trapped atoms is interferometry, which can be used to realize gyroscopes, accelerometers, and gravimeters that are expected to be orders of magnitude more sensitive than current state-of-the-art technologies. Such devices are crucial for navigational positioning systems and satellite communications, and therefore are of great interest to both commercialand defense-oriented markets. Optical trapping is also vital for the next generation of neutral atomic clocks, whose accuracy is now exceeding a phenomenal 1 part in 10^17 (i.e. a loss of 1 second every 3 billion years). Optically trapped atoms are also ideal for implementing quantum information algorithms, and therefore have many applications in the emerging fields of quantum computation and information processing. For basic science, optical lattices have been used for precision measurements of fundamental constants, some of the most stringent tests of the Standard Model of Physics, and groundbreaking studies of many-body physics.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the development of a multifunctional solid-state nanolaminate composite, which may function as a structural material while storing energy in the form of a rechargeable super-capacitor. A unique production process is used, where liquid monomer and aluminum wire are introduced into a process chamber that converts them into a multilayer composite with thousands of polymer and aluminum layers. Applications include storage devices for battery back-up and inverter circuits used in transportation and high energy density capacitors for extreme thermo-mechanical environments, such as aircraft, photovoltaics and aerospace. The Phase I development work demonstrated the production of large area (10sq.ft.) energy storage material. The nanolaminate material has mechanical properties that are close to a hard polymer laminate and energy densities which are an order of magnitude higher than conventional electrostatic capacitors and similar to those of electrochemical super-capacitors, with superior performance at temperatures below -20C and above +65C. The Phase II effort includes development work to optimize certain manufacturing methods, optimization of the polymer dielectric, packaging development, creation of specification sheets based on short and long term life tests and sampling potential customers that represent immediate and long term business opportunities. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is in the utilization of a new multifunctional material that can store energy. Such material may be integrated into a structure and save space and weight. It is a green product that requires no water or solvents to produce, it is recyclable and it does not involve the use or disposal of hazardous materials. Nanolaminate energy storage products will be based on mainly two materials, aluminum wire and acrylate monomers, which are commonly used to produce protective coatings for flooring, printing, furniture, window films, etc. Lightweight energy storage nanolaminates can replace double layer electrochemical super-capacitors that have severe temperature limitations and conventional electrostatic capacitors, in applications where volume, weight and thermomechanical constraints such as vibration and operating temperature are limiting factors. Capacitors produced using nanolaminate composites, are solid-state components that can electrically self-heal and have an open-circuit, or fuse-like safe failure mode, which is desirable in applications such as electric vehicles and aircraft, where safety of people in the proximity of a capacitor bank is of paramount importance. Multifunctional materials are expected to play a key role in the future in improving energy efficiencies and reducing dependency on fossil fuels.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to complete development of a universal, in vitro assay for determining the enzymatic activity of botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT)-based pharmaceuticals. This assay, called BoTest Matrix A Assay, will enable standardized comparisons of different BoNT preparations, regardless of manufacturer. BoNTs are used in many different cosmetic and pharmaceutical applications due to their exquisite specificity for motor neurons and their long-lasting effects. Currently, the strength and quality of BoNT-based pharmaceuticals is assessed using a mouse bioassay where BoNT is injected into dozens of mice and a unit of activity depends on the rate or proportion of mouse deaths. Beyond the obvious concerns about animal testing, the variability of the mouse bioassay and the lack of suitable standards and uniform protocols among manufacturers put patient safety and clinical outcomes at risk. The proposed assay(s) will reduce the use of animals and will provide a method to uniformly assess the activity of BoNT-based pharmaceuticals, thus increasing patient safety and the likelihood of successful treatment. The broader/commercial impacts of this research are improved procedures and protocols that would greatly increase patient safety while reducing animal testing. The BoTest Matrix Assay would be applicable to all stages of BoNT-based drug manufacturing, including quality control, quantification, stability testing, and decontamination testing at manufacturing sites?all applications that are currently performed with animal assays. In addition, the assay would be applicable for authenticity testing (against counterfeit drugs) at border control points and inoffice testing for high-dose procedures where toxin activity concentration is critical for clinical outcomes. The proposed technology would be also the first of its kind on the commercial market. Other commercially available assays for detecting BoNT activity are not suitable for assessing BoNT-based pharmaceuticals, because the stabilizers added to the pharmaceutical formulations interfere with those assays. The proposed technology could be further adapted for testing BoNT activity in highly complex matrices (e.g., blood, food, water). Thus, the assay&#039;s utility would extend into food, biodefense, and environmental testing.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is directed towards the development of an ultrahigh speed micro-spindle for micro-machining. The proposed spindle for micro-milling and micro-grinding at speeds near 500,000 rpm will be implemented with existing commercial micro-machining systems. Micro-manufacturing refers to the creation of high-precision three-dimensional (3D) products using a variety of materials and possessing features with sizes ranging from tens of micrometers to a few millimeters. While micro-scale technologies are well established in the semiconductor and microelectronics fields, the same cannot be said for manufacturing products involving complex 3D geometry and high accuracies in non-silicon materials. The trends in industrial and military products that demand miniaturization, design flexibility, reduced energy consumption, and high accuracy continue to accelerate -- especially in the medical, biotechnology, telecommunications, and energy fields. The principal advantages of the proposed micro-spindle include higher production rates and precision obtained through the implementation of ultrahigh speed machining that will decrease the cutting forces and tool vibrations. The prototype micro-spindle will be evaluated in a series of alpha and beta testing with commercial micro-machining systems. The objective of Phase II is to perform the necessary R &amp; D to prepare the micro-spindle for marketing. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project encompasses the following. The ultrahigh speed micro-spindle will enable the production of cost-effective micro-components and will positively impact the micro-fabrication industry. Since the underlying scientific principles of micromachining at such high speeds are not known, the availability of the proposed spindle will allow for basic studies to uncover the response of materials under these conditions. Such basic information could lead to new scientific discoveries and further extend the micromachining processes. The data and information generated will undoubtedly be used in future for training of graduate students. The broad impact of this research includes expansion of micromanufacturing research, and research opportunities for next-generation scientific researchers and technology developers to pursue micro machining and micro manufacturing related efforts in the broader fields of micro positioning devices, micro die-and-mold manufacturing, micro sensing and monitoring systems, and micro factory integrations and optimization. Commercialization of the proposed micro-milling spindle will be instrumental in the development of new businesses and industries, and high value added jobs.",

One of the applications is a wound-healing product for diabetic foot ulcers. This project will focus on 1) optimizing the process parameters required to scale production of a nitric-oxide-releasing API to reproducible 1 kg batches, and 2) implementing the analytical methodologies to meet the requirements of the Chemistry, Manufacturing and Control (CMC) sections of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application. The expected outcome is a manufacturing process capable of producing large batches of the API that are suitable for an IND submission of a wound-healing product for diabetic foot ulcers or other nitric-oxide-releasing drug. The broader/commercial impacts of this project will be the potential to provide a new standard of care for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers. Currently, there are no products that address both wound healing and infection in diabetic foot ulcers. Infection is particularly problematic in diabetic foot ulcers due to the lack of normal skin barrier function, long duration of wound exposure to the external environment (months to years), poor blood circulation to the extremities that limits the migration of inflammatory cells to the site of infection, and the recent understanding of biofilm formation which protects bacteria from topically applied antimicrobials and systemically administered antibiotics. Nitric-oxide-releasing wound-healing therapeutics have the potential of addressing both infection and healing in diabetic foot ulcers.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes to develop a &quot;close-to-care&quot; instrument that can assess antibiotic susceptibility of infection-causing bacteria in less than one hour. MEMS-fabricated sensors and integrated fluidics will measure the mass and growth rate of a small number of bacteria in-vitro with a resolution near 1 femtogram. By exposing the bacteria to a panel of antibiotics while monitoring growth rate, an infection&#039;s susceptibility profile will be determined very rapidly. Using this information, doctors will be able to select targeted antibiotic treatment much faster than is possible using conventional methods that require incubation and take 24 hours or longer - a crucial time savings. The platform will be validated on multiple E. coli strains that have a range of susceptibility, in both saline and healthy urine matrices. To demonstrate clinical value, the results will be compared to conventional methods. Additional tests will be performed on clinical isolates of E. coli and K. pneumoniae that cause urinary tract infections, and on MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus). The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be to improve medical outcomes of infection and to facilitate antibiotic stewardship. The rapidly expanding prevalence of resistant bacteria, combined with a decline in the discovery of new antibiotics, pose one of today&#039;s most dire health threats. More than 100,000 people die of infections each year in the U.S., behind only cancer and heart disease. There is unanimous consensus among infectious disease experts that rapid diagnostics to identify resistance are crucial for administering targeted antibiotic therapy, leading to better outcomes, and for minimizing the spread of resistant strains. The test to be developed here directly addresses these needs. The project targets UTI (urinary tract infections) that are responsible for the majority of hospital-acquired infections; and MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) that kills more than 20,000 Americans every year. The platform will be configured for &quot;close-to-care&quot; use in microbiology labs found in most hospitals, and capture a significant fraction of the $500M U.S. market for susceptibility testing equipment and reagents.

Science education involves the collection, manipulation, and examination of data, most of which is in visually based textual form, which is problematic for students with print disabilities. The project objectives involve the development of non-visually-based technology for the collection and manipulation of data. The LabQuest, a popular scientific data-collection device used in many mainstream classrooms, is currently not accessible by students with print disabilities because it is operated through a text-rich, visual touch-screen menu. The objectives of Phase II focus on making all features of the LabQuest accessible to students with print disabilities through fully incorporating text-to-speech software (resulting in an enhanced version of the Talking LabQuest developed during Phase I), non-visual collection and manipulation of data, the development of software interfaces between the Talking LabQuest and peripheral devices such as Braille note-takers (non-visually-based computerized devices frequently used by individuals with visual impairments for storing and manipulating data) and embossers for producing tactile graphs. All features, functions, and interfaces developed will be field tested by individuals with print disabilities for ease of operability. Based on Phase I successes, it is anticipated that individuals with print disabilities will be able to independently operate the proposed technology. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project concerns the inclusion in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education and professions of a population that has typically been disenfranchised from these fields. Persons with print disabilities are underrepresented in postsecondary studies and careers in STEM fields. Behavioral research suggests that self-belief in one&#039;s capacity to independently function in a particular field is an important determining factor in whether one chooses that field as a career path, and that hands-on experiences contribute to one&#039;s self-belief regarding the capacity to independently function. Data from Phase I of this SBIR project are consistent with behavioral science research; specifically, it was demonstrated that the technology can be independently operated by students who are blind or visually impaired to collect and manipulate data. Phase I findings also indicated that these hands-on science experiences were associated with increased beliefs in students? capacity to independently function in science activities, increased inclination to consider postsecondary studies and careers in STEM, and improved academic outcomes. These data suggest that wide commercial availability of the proposed enhanced technology will help increase the representation of individuals with print disabilities in STEM studies and professions. Persons with print disabilities will be able to work independently in science classrooms and laboratories, and will be able to choose educational and career paths based on aptitude and interest. Additionally, because individuals with disabilities are frequently unemployed or underemployed and receive government assistance, their increased entry into STEM fields may reduce taxpayer burden.",

The GEM Project uses the natural youthful attraction of green studies as a magnet to draw students into meaningful and relevant STEM studies. The Phase II GEM Project will frame an expanded list of Phase I STEM core topics and studies in the context of green engineering activities, providing students with authentic experiences that support the learning of STEM concepts presented in class.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project proposes to commercialize liquid submersion cooling for computer servers. Liquid submersion cooling involves submersion of heat-generating components in a non-electrically-conductive liquid, replacing air as the heat transfer medium. Liquid is significantly better than air to transfer heat, but historically has required cost-prohibitive capital expenditures due to the added complexity of previous liquid cooling architectures. The research objectives are to produce a system capable of being mass produced at low cost, and with compelling system features that drive customer demand. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes lowering of one of the largest marginal contributors to US electricity use. The EPA estimates that data centers now use nearly 3% of US electricity, up from nearly 1% in 2000, with nearly half of power being driven by using air as the primary heat transfer medium. This high-efficiency system offers the potential to cut total energy use by nearly 50% by nearly eliminating energy for cooling and reducing server power through internal fan removal, while offering higher cooling performance and lower costs. Also, this new heat-recapture system offers the potential to eliminate nearly all server energy in many locales. Alternate cooling solutions that are cost effective only offer marginal improvements, and as computing becomes a larger part of the economy, the search for more energy and cost efficient technologies will become more critical.",

Real time battlefield information, from communications and situational awareness assets, is becoming more critical to commanders for moment-to-moment decision-making. To address this need, GAC proposes a disposable satellite-like aerial platform. GAC&#039;s approach satisfies the Army&#039;s need for an aerial platform that can instantly be deployed above a battlefield by a missile and that is designed to support Army Enterprise payloads. One concept of operations has a payload and stowed aerial platform being placed into the weapon bay of a tactical missile. The missile and platform are then programmed for launch and deployment, respectively, at a desired geographic location and altitude above a battlefield. GAC&#039;s concept is lightweight and low-cost; has a selectable deployment altitude and target range; achieves high-speed deceleration and orientation of missile forebody for platform deployment; incorporates a controller that initiates deployment; features a reliable and robust deployment method; and finally, easily scales up to larger missile size, for larger Army payloads or higher altitude, with little increase in unit cost.",

        "abstract": "Despite technical advances to intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities, intelligence analysts in the theater cannot achieve true multi-INT exploitation and cross-cueing due to the stove-piped nature of fielded ISR systems which limits effective collaboration among analysts. Current ISR systems: (1) force human-to-human interaction to be the primary method to discover relevant information, despite its inefficiency; and (2) require significant development for modification, leading to traditionally long delays before new capabilities transition to the field, forcing analysts to adapt in the meantime by using manual fusion techniques and&quot;swivel-chair integration.&quot;Analysts must overcome these limitations on collaboration before they can achieve superior operational performance. To enable the human component to fully leverage emerging integrated global ISR systems through effective analyst collaboration for automated multi-INT exploitation and cross-cueing for a wide variety of missions, we propose to develop and evaluate a Social Platform for an ISR Collaboration Environment (SPLICE). SPLICE will maximize analyst efficiency within emerging global ISR systems by providing a novel collaboration platform for intelligence analysts to discover relevant information and rapidly capture, reuse, and share analyst workflow processes. This combined approach provides a platform for intelligence analysts that can revolutionize multi-INT exploitation and cross-cueing for an ever-changing battlespace.",

The proposed scheme utilizes the AMS proprietary active cavity amplifier (ACA) technology in conjunction with a phased antenna array. Each of the array elements is to be driven by one independently controllable amplifier, to achieve high level of agility, lethality and portability. Task for AMS in Phase II is to develop an efficient high power amplifier suitable to be used in an array as described. The effort in Phase I has indicated that it will be feasible to achieve in a mid UHF band amplifier design with dimensions at ~ 12-14 diameter by ~12 long, and is capable of 10 kW peak power with 30-50 ms pulse widths. Higher power and longer pulse widths are possible subject to power supply limitations and other peripheral issues.",

Small, hand-launchable UAVs in particular are a key component as they allow individual units to gather critical information from safe operational distances. However, the limited size, weight, and power (SWaP) resources of small UAVs has led to a disparity in capabilities between those platforms and the larger UAVs controlled at the Brigade or higher echelon. In order to bridge this capabilities gap, Toyon proposes to develop an effects delivery payload: a modular, self-contained all-digital low-SWaP embedded system including video capture and processing, target tracking, and H.264 compression. The EffecDiv payload will be paired with ground control software to automate UAV search, routing, and sensor control that maximizes sensor eyes-on-target. The payload will also be accessible via an EffecDiv Android-based app running on a smartphone or handheld. These capabilities will enable the user to rapidly detect, geo-locate, and track targets of interest with high accuracy. EffecDiv will seamlessly integrate with ARDEC&#039;s Firestorm weapon-target pairing system to hand-off target information to the unit effects network and support target engagement and effects delivery. The EffecDiv payload will be implemented on a heterogeneous computing platform, employing FPGAs and other processors, to minimize the system&#039;s SWaP. The payload will implement standards-based interfaces and protocols to maximize inter-operability with existing systems and networks.",

The REL is then screened for the presence of potential virulence factors with an array of pull-down assays that employ components of the host&quot;s extracellular matrix, mucus, and basement membrane as bait.  The host bait proteins interact with and capture pathogen prey proteins that may play a role in the pathogenic process.  The potential virulence factors are then identified by mass spectrometry and proteomic methodologies.  RVFDS can also define the immunome or complete repertoire of immunogenic proteins of a pathogen using antibodies from convalescent patients as bait in pull-down assays.    Presently investigations into the host-pathogen relationship are severely hampered by the fact that the pathogen is grown under laboratory conditions that simulate the host environment, and thus, many of the virulence factors that are expressed in response to the true host environment are overlooked.  RVFDS circumvents this overwhelming challenge because virtually all of the open reading frames of a pathogen are expressed and are easily and rapidly identified.",

Our approach focuses on and exploits what malicious insiders seek (illicitly acquired information), as opposed to incidental signs of misbehavior. Our approach also identifies users who make inappropriate trust decision putting organizations at risk.  This provides a robust alternative and a good complement to passive-detection mechanisms. In Phase 1, we proposed to (a) investigate and design an insider detection architecture based on this notion of misinformation, and (b) demonstrate the feasibility of identifying specific types of insiders by developing a prototype for automatically generating and distributing believable misinformation based on pre-defined templates, and then tracking access and attempted misuse of it through integration with an open-source DLP system. In Phase 2, we will extend and instantiate our architecture, also expanding our system capabilities to generate documents that use information harvested from real sources.

        "abstract": "One of the current limitations for mobile robotics walking is efficient actuation. The standard actuation technologies that have been used in mobile robotic platforms are servo-hydraulics, electro-hydraulics and electro-mechanical actuation.  The hydraulic options have a high power density and pack well but are very inefficient leading to carrying extra batteries in mobile applications.  The electro mechanical options improve on efficiency but require the actuation to be located at the point of actuation, leading to large masses on the legs and significant increases in power consumption.  On top of that, these designs have limited success addressing the large ranges of power output found in legged locomotion in particular the range between walking and running.  This work intends to develop a new method of actuation that is uniquely capable to meet the needs of mobile legged robotic applications.  The proposed solution is a hydraulic based design that uses active control of pump displacement to manipulate its performance characteristics.  The proposed solution will allow many joints to operate off a single motor without losses from valves.  The proposed active displacement hydraulic power unit will provide system bandwidth comparable to servo-hydraulics and efficiencies better than electro-mechanical systems in an easy to package quite design.",

        "abstract": "A good method for improving the survivability of soldiers on the ground is to help ensure that threats can be eliminated quickly before posing a significant threat. One way to accomplish this is to ensure that shots fired by soldiers hit targets quickly and efficiently. A soldiers preference is to impact the target with the first shot. However, there is a complex set of factors that dictate where a bullet will impact and these cannot always be effectively predicted by the soldier. There is a need for a system that can track fired shots, identify the amount of error in the shot (that is the distance between the bullet and the target), calculate a new aim point, and display this aim point for the soldier.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  SBG Labs has developed a display technology with a suite of disruptive characteristics ideally suited for next-generation helmet mounted displays (HMDs). The key characteristics of this novel HMD are: (1) a 90a field of view with a 30a binocular overlap at the center; (2) high-resolution digital imagery focused at infinity and close to the limit of human visual acuity over the entire field of view; (3) a panoramic regard much greater than the displayed imagery with high (&gt;90%) see-through, generous eye box, and adequate eye relief; and (4) a light-weight, low-profile design that fits comfortably inside a visor or protective goggles. During Phase I, SBG Labs demonstrated the technical feasibility of a novel eye tracker capability, one which can be integrated with the above HMD without disrupting hard-won performance or adding significant weight. That is, the solution is able to unobtrusively share the existing optics while still meeting stringent eye-tracking requirements. Under Phase II, SBG Labs will implement the detailed optical design developed in Phase I, as well as the associated electronics and image processing algorithms required to extract the direction of gaze. The system will be integrated with an HMD of the type above and demonstrated to AF personnel.  BENEFIT:  A see-through display must satisfy a suite of very challenging requirements; including wide field of view, high resolution, focus at infinity, good luminance, and adequate dynamic grayscale. The HMD developed by SBG Labs is the first to meet all of the above requirements. The benefit to the warfighter is vastly improved situational awareness and comfort. Adding an eye tracker to this HMD provides additional benefits. First and foremost, eye tracking extends the pilots ability to designate targets well beyond head-motion limits. Additionally, eye tracking can be used to psychometrically monitor pilot alertness or measure a trainees learning curve. A wide-field-of-view see-through display is a dual-use product. SBG Labs hopes to leverage the proposed development into OEM components for consumer head-worn video displays. The channel to market will be the same as SBG Labs other products: major consumer electronics companies. Since military devices can support a higher price point than commercial ones and entail lower production volumes, having the DoD as a first customer will enable SBG Labs to gradually ramp up its manufacturing infrastructure and engineer out the cost. In the long term, commercial demand will outstrip defense demand, driving down cost to the DoD and spurring further technical development.",

Further, the payloads on many satellites are also highly transient.  Because of the combination of these two conditions, time varying thermal distortions are often experienced which can result in degraded performance or complete mission failure.  In Phase I, a novel idea to achieve a thermally stable panel (TSP) through the coupled use of a multi-evaporator hybrid loop heat pipe (ME-HLHP) with low profile evaporators and low thermal expansion composite isogrid panels was proposed.    The subsequent thermal modeling of this architecture has shown the ability to achieve a uniform panel temperature distribution; thereby, minimizing the distortion associated with the thermal transients.  Further, fabrication of select portions of the design has been successfully demonstrated.  In Phase 2, verification of the thermal model through testing will be performed.  Further, the fabrication techniques will be extended to produce larger scale prototypes.  These prototypes will demonstrate the scalability of the design and its ability to minimize thermal distortions.

The tool will be able to characterize arbitrary geometric configurations of fiber metal laminates with the coexistence of multiple metal ply and delamination cracks. High computational efficiency and modeling fidelity will be achieved via the development of a mesh independent discrete crack network model for co-simulation of a curvilinear fatigue crack growth in a metal ply and propagation of a delamination with its arbitrary front. A Moment Schema Finite Element coupled with XFEM will be developed to efficiently simulate the crack growth in a thin laminated structure. A mesh independent adaptive fracture process zone model will also be developed in HYSEFDA for accurate extraction of fracture parameters along the delamination crack front that is not in conformation to the existing FEM mesh. An advanced fatigue damage accumulation model coupled with a cycle-by-cycle numerical integration will be developed to capture the load sequence effects. GEM has secured commitments for technical support and commercialization assistance from Alcoa for module development, toolkit verification and validation at component and structural level.  BENEFIT:  The Phase II research will develop a versatile, user-friendly, and computationally efficient toolkit for Abaqus (HYSEFDA) that is capable of prediction of fracture pattern and fatigue life of non-traditional hybrid materials/structures under variable amplitude loading. The end product from this research will have significant benefits and commercial application in the Air Force, DoD Labs, and other commercial industries for optimal hybrid system design and performance of virtual testing of the selected hybrid material/structure system. The tool can be used by government agencies and private industries as follows: 1) to accelerate fatigue damage and residual strength assessment, assist in decision making for effective maintenance and repairs, and design reliable AHSs to ensure airworthiness; 2) to specify fatigue performance limits and safety standards for structural certification and design agencies; and 3) to provide optimal designs through the effective use of new analysis tools, risk evaluation methods, and health management procedures for aircraft manufacturers.",

However, in a complex urban battlespace, where GPS may be denied or inaccurate due to multipath, heavy foliage, or obscuring structures, advanced methods are required to localize and continuously track soldiers. Current Dead Reckoning Filters for GPS-denied navigation assume all steps are forward steps and therefore perform poorly. Scientific Systems Company Inc.

        "abstract": "Flight simulation provides a cost effective tool for testing aircraft systems. Testing avionics systems across a particular flight profile requires driving the simulation through the flight profile to generate the required simulated sensor data. Testing avionics systems with a human pilot is costly and it cannot provide precise repeatability, which is essential to evaluating the effect of mission parameters on aircraft survivability. However, a&quot;virtual pilot&quot;is capable of generating a repeatable control, which guarantees an identical flight every time. Development of a virtual pilot that can address a range of maneuvers and which can be adapted to various aircraft configurations is a demanding task. Most current methods are not feasible for use by application Test Engineers since those methods require manual tuning of the virtual pilot for each configuration and for each maneuver. Under this SBIR, ART proposes to develop a virtual pilot control generation tool that can accomplish the task effectively. The problems of accuracy, robustness, and efficiency will be addressed using the advanced inverse simulation technique, the mathematical optimization method, a feedback compensator, and parallel computing. A graphical user interface will be developed in order to facilitate the tool usage. The innovation involved is the integration of the diverse technologies of rotorcraft modeling, inverse simulation, and optimization into a unified tool that is efficient and effective in providing a repeatable control history to drive nonlinear rotorcraft models through user defined flight profiles.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will continue the commercial development of the Liquid Tin Anode Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (LTA-SOFC) for direct conversion of biomass to electrical power. The LTA-SOFC is a transformational energy technology that dramatically increases the efficiency and simplicity of power generation from conventional fuels. In biopower, the LTA-SOFC provides a pathway to improve efficiency and capital cost and also enables smaller scale applications. Phase I successfully demonstrated the feasibility of direct biomass conversion to power, using biomass feed stocks which can have significant societal, environmental and economic impacts. Specifically in Phase I several different types of biomass including poplar and switchgrass were used to generate power in an actual LTA-SOFC cell. Post-test analysis indicated no ash fusion and near 100% fuel utilization (little residual carbon left). The Phase II effort will continue development of biopower applications for LTA-SOFC by demonstrating biomass fuel efficiency in a small stack assembly with continuous feeding. Also, evaluation of the fate of biomass-specific volatile components such as potassium will contribute to the understanding of LTA-SOFC longevity. Phase II will demonstrate additional LTA-SOFC biopower technical performance to reduce risk and increase the potential for commercialization of LTA-SOFC biopower. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be increased use of renewable power. Currently biomass contributes only 1% of U.S. electric power despite available resources to provide over 20%. Increased use of biomass for electric power will reduce carbon emissions, increase energy security and create domestic jobs. Efficiencies lower than 20% and high capital cost of today?s technology make conventional biomass power about twice as expensive as coal limiting market penetration to about 1%. LTA-SOFC Direct Biomass generators will reduce the cost of power and lower capital cost while reducing emissions and feedstock consumption by 2-3 times. The EIA predicts that by 2030, biomass will generate 4.5% of U.S electricity, representing an available market for LTA-SOFC of about $30 billion. The LTA-SOFC commercialization strategy starts with small devices. Growth into commercial markets will provide the maturity required for more demanding biomass power markets. In the biopower area military users have powerful adoption incentive that will encourage them to become early adopters. The US defense establishment has a goal to use renewable energy for 25% of the facility electrical consumption by 2025. This SBIR will reduce technical risk, providing confidence for integrator partners to co-invest in commercialization of LTA-SOFC biomass generators.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will enable Energetiq Technology, Inc. to develop and commercialize an advanced Open-Path FTIR Spectrometer (OPFTIR) instrument for monitoring of atmospheric gases over extended distances. The Phase II technical goals will be the optimization of a high-brightness infrared source and optical subsystem that will enable long path instrument capabilities. For current FTIR instruments the infrared light source is a thermal blackbody, limited to operating temperatures of approximately 1000 C. For OP-FTIR instruments the consequences of relying on such low-brightness light sources are (a) bulky and expensive IR optics; (b) expensive IR detectors; and (c) limited monitoring range ? typically less than a few hundred meters. The laser heated IR light source developed in Phase I has demonstrated greater than 2000C operation. Direct comparison with a standard GlobarTM source shows an improvement in signal amplitude of between 2 and 10 (depending on wavelength) and signal to noise measurements imply an improvement in detectability of from 1.5 to about 6. The broader impacts of this research are in the area of environmental monitoring and potentially in Homeland Security applications. The cost and size of OP-FTIR instruments will be reduced and the range and sensitivity increased. With increased emphasis on monitoring total fluxes of atmospheric pollutants, including global warming gases such as CO2, OP-FTIR instruments will be even more widely used in the future.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop long fiber thermoplastic (LFT) compositions based on recycled carbon fiber. In Phase I, we demonstrated the ability to make high quality LFT formulations based on (1) waste carbon fiber and (2) composites scrap and end-of-life thermoplastic and thermoset carbon fiber composites. Mechanical properties of these composites were similar to, and in some cases superior to, those for virgin carbon fiber. In this project, we will continue to develop manufacturing capabilities to make both thermoset and thermoplastic composites. In this Phase II project, we will look at the following technical issues: (1) examining the use of new recycled fiber forms and comparing the results to prior data; (2) investigating the molding parameters associated with the &quot;forging&quot; of flat blanks of LFT; (3) optimizing the LFT compositions; (4) demonstrating consistent moldability and mechanical properties; and (5) demonstrating the conversion of molded LFT parts back into LFT compound to &quot;close the loop&quot; on recycling. This effort will feature partnerships with a not-for-profit composites laboratory and another small business, both of whom have extensive experience in developing LFTs using virgin carbon fiber. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes a reduction in the amount of carbon fiber going into landfills and lower greenhouse gas emissions. Worldwide carbon fiber production is ~80 million pounds per year, with demand growing at ~15% annually. Conservatively, 20% of this fiber ends up as waste during composite manufacture (~16 million pounds/year) and is landfilled. The aerospace industry is a main consumer of this material (military aircraft, Boeing 787 and Airbus A380), but industrial, automotive, and recreational markets are also growing. However, few composite manufacturing processes are designed to work with chopped fibers, which is the primary form of recycled carbon fiber. Developing LFTs based on recycled carbon fiber will allow us to achieve &quot;Three Shades of Green&quot; by eliminating landfilling, reducing energy costs relative to virgin fiber, and improving sustainability. A significant business opportunity exists if manufacturing methods can be developed that use recycled fiber in the forms that are typical of reclaimed material. The potential market for composites made from recycled/reclaimed carbon fiber is more than $200 million. Finally, the amount of energy needed to recycle carbon fiber is only about 4% of that needed to make virgin fiber, reducing associated greenhouse gas emissions.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to develop a low cost packaged near-infrared on-chip silicon absorption spectrometer for simultaneous and specific detection of multiple volatile organic compounds in water (ground water, waste water and drinking water). In phase I, the volatile organic compound xylene was successfully detected in water at 100 parts per billion through near-infrared absorption signatures, on chip with 300 micron long photonic crystal slot waveguides which represents the best results in device sensitivity and in miniaturization. The device combines slow light effect in photonic crystal waveguides with highly concentrated optical field intensity in a low index slot at the center of the photonic crystal waveguide. The photonic crystal slot waveguide proposed herein provides a factor of 1000 reduction in interaction length compared to conventional waveguides leading to enhanced optical absorption by analytes in the optical path. Transmission is measured from multiple waveguides covering the entire near-infrared wavelength range, and absorbance determined by measuring transmission differences in the presence and the absence of any volatile organic compound analytes of interest. The miniature spectrometer will enable massively parallel identification and high throughput analysis. The broader impacts of this research are the enabling of continuous, remote, in-situ monitoring and unique identification of multiple volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in groundwater, drinking water, and waste water, with high sensitivity and specificity, a facility that is not available commercially at present. The integrated silicon platform ensures low cost production in high volume. From commercial standpoint, the United Nations Environment Program estimates the global water market to expand to $660 billion from the current $250 billion by 2020. The proposed photonic crystal slot waveguide device can be expected to occupy a significant position in this market. The generalized design of the proposed versatile technology implies possible implementation in multiple areas of in-situ analyte sensing, detection, and spectroscopy such as control of food, air, and water quality and health, in a lab-on-chip platform with low cost of ownership. Through continuous, in-situ and remote monitoring, the prototype developed from this research will eliminate the lag time that currently exists in industrial water monitoring, sometimes extending to few months as in VOC monitoring of rivers and lakes, thereby enabling early warning of spurious leaks and spills instead of after-the-fact damage control and mediation and thus enhance environmental and national security.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  CFDRC proposes to develop a high-fidelity simulation capability and probabilistic description for the unguided dispensing of submunition projectiles from weapons systems. The proposed technology will be based on the Loci/CHEM software framework. In the Phase I effort, a rigid body collision module for Loci/CHEM was developed and the accuracy and scalability of the proposed technology was successfully demonstrated for multiple projectiles in proximate flight at supersonic speed. The Phase II effort will focus on a) full implementation of the coupled simulation capability, b) application demonstrations for capturing dominant influence factors in the dispersion process, and c) development of a design-of-experiment methodology to deliver probabilistic projectile state definitions with reasonable computational effort. The resulting probabilistic definition of projectile spatial distribution and flight state will be employed to investigate optimal deployment strategies, and recommendations will be made for achieving even projectile distribution patterns over a target area. This Phase II effort will enable high-fidelity simulations of large number of bodies in high-speed proximate flight with optimal parallel scalability, and provide the means to reduce the complexity by introducing a probabilistic model to describe the aerodynamic interference-dominated phase. The culmination of these efforts will enable radical reduction in CPU requirements and design cycle time over existing approaches.  BENEFIT:  Military Application: The resulting simulation capability will enable design and evaluation of technology and concept maturation for safe dispensing and pin-point delivery of payloads. It will support integration design of submunition and ordnance ejection processes for hypersonic and lower Mach airframes. Other military applications include modeling and simulation of multiple store separation and dispensing from wing or weapon bay platforms to support store certification efforts, simulation of debris/fragments trajectories resulting from accidental explosions or planned missile intercept. Commercial Application: The predictive capabilities will benefit system design and process planning for air delivery of payloads such as humanitarian relief supplies. The methodology will help predict payload ground-impact distributions for flight regimes intended for commercial applications.",

In the same manner as our previous single hit FRMs were developed for RC bunkers and MOUT structures.

As stated in Air Force Topic AF103-131, the disintegration of overloaded walls and slabs generates two important secondary effects that can be lethal to personnel, equipment, and structural components located in adjoining rooms; the first is secondary debris from fragmentation of the wall/slab component and the second is secondary air blast that can, in many circumstances, interact with the disintegrating wall and project blast and dynamic pressure loadings.  Current HFPB FRMs that are used to predict weapons effectiveness or assess human or building lethality do not account for these effects.  This can have negative impacts on collateral damage estimation and weaponeering activities.  The DoD needs a new generation of FRMs to improve their prediction capabilities in these areas.

These GaSb based LEDs incorporate both mid-wave and long-wave infrared active regions and can emit simultaneously at both wavelengths with independent control of the relative intensities of the two bands. The GaSb material system is flexible enough to combine Type-I mid-wave active regions and Type-II long-wave active regions on the same substrate. The proposed device emits at 3.2 microns and 8 microns, although the material system allows for tremendous wavelength flexibility within the 2 micron to 16 micron range.    Deep grooves around each pixel allow for independent contacts at each pixel location to each of the two active regions. The arrays will ideally have dedicated dual-color read-in-integrated-circuits (RIICs) for the best performance. If a dedicated RIIC is not available, we propose demonstrating LED arrays of 512x256 pixels using existing single color RIICs intended for 512x512 pixel applications. These existing RIICs can drive the LED array with reduced resolution until a dedicated RIIC can be made available.     BENEFIT:  The GaSb material system allows efficient LEDs and LED arrays to be produced over a wide spectral range. The proposed LED array can emit simultaneously and independently at 3.2 microns and 8 microns from each pixel.

Typical&#039;&#039;cooperative&#039;&#039;bio-signatures (e.g. fingerprints, retinal scans) require that an individual agreeably come in contact with a sensor, which is not applicable to realistic battlefield conditions, tracking non-cooperative dismounts. Toyon proposes to develop non-cooperative and remote bio-signature technologies that can be integrated with fusion and ATR algorithms and applied to multi-layer sensing networks. An Exploitation and Feature Extraction (EFE) module will be designed for each type of sensor in the layered sensing architecture. The unique features extracted from each sensor will be included with that sensor&#039;s measurements as they are sent to an Autonomous Tracked Object Manager (ATOM). ATOM will use sensor measurements and features to ID and track targets of interest. ATOM will also interface with a database search and correlation tool that can query a biometric database such as the Automated Biometric Identification System (ABIS) and correlate the target&#039;s features with stored biometrics on known targets. ATOM will also feed target tracks to platform/sensor control optimization algorithms that provide C2 feedback to the sensors in the system to maximize information gain.    BENEFIT:  There is a great interest in surveillance technologies that track and identify objects and dismounts. The proposed technology will use features to maintain continuous long-term track on a target of interest. Continuous long-term tracks are necessary to identify anomalous target behavior, highlight illicit activities, and engage targets. Further, the proposed work will help identify non-cooperative dismounts using remote sensors, from standoff distances that were previously impossible. This addresses essential capability requirements in layered sensing systems, and will help support effective use of bio-signatures to identify and track dismounts.  This identity information can help intelligence analysts connect specific people to events and locations, and learn about insurgent operations.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Current methods for physically interconnecting electrical interfaces on micro-munitions to host platforms or other carriage devices rely on traditional military style circular connectors.  These connectors typically have significant physical footprints in locations where space is at a premium, exhibit undesirably high release forces that constrain potential store ejection techniques, have reliability/durability issues, and are cumbersome to connect for some physical installation arrangements.  An alternative connector-less micro-munition interface interconnection concept defined under Phase I utilizing fiber optic signal transfer techniques and inductive power coupling was assessed as a potentially significant improvement over current approaches.  The fiber optic technology element of the proposed concept was identified as also being applicable to current initiatives to incorporate a fiber optic interface capability into the MIL-STD-1760 aircraft/store interface, to support future enhanced signal throughput requirements anticipated for advanced weapon carriage platforms including the F-35.  The effort proposed here would develop a fiber optic munition interface capability and demonstrate it as part of the connector-less micro-munition interface concept defined under Phase I, and also as part of a MIL-STD-1760 connector-based interface arrangement.  Recommended additions to current interface standards to incorporate the developed capability would also be provided.  BENEFIT:  The results of this effort will facilitate easier and more reliable mating of munition interfaces with host platforms while enhancing performance, and also provide significant commercial potential for improved integration of external sensors on non-military air and ground platforms.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  As the Air Force moves toward the deployment of CubeSats and the need for responsive launches, operational Plug-and-Play instruments to monitor the space environment become necessary. The goal of Phase-II is to develop and deliver a prototype for a new UV remote sensing instrument for ionospheric measurements that are relevant to Space Situational Awareness, and the IORD-II requirements. The instrument will be PnP compatible, and substantial PnP development is required for this application, building on Phase-I experience. While the prototype will use an existing scan mechanism that is larger and heavier than necessary, later generations of the instrument will easily fit in a 3U CubeSat.  The project represents advances in PnP technology, the TRL of components including scan mechanism, UV photometer, and Rad-hard ASIMs. It also improves on existing AF capabilities for measuring the nightside ionosphere.  BENEFIT:  While the prototype will use an existing scan mechanism that is larger and heavier than necessary, later generations of the instrument will easily fit in a 3U CubeSat. The new instrument will be much less expensive and will be a factor of ten smaller in Size, Weight, Power, and Cost than the existing DMSP imagers. The new instrument will perform nightside ionospheric imaging with a field of regard similar to the existing DMSP imagers, but with much higher signal to noise ratio. Thus the new instrument will extend the latitudinal range of useful ionospheric measurements beyond the Equatorial Ionospheric Anomaly (EIA) region. The instrument will image the background ionosphere, ionospheric irregularities and the aurora, and provides TEC below the satellite. Numerous commercial and government applications of the technology are described.",

        "abstract": "The ultimate objective of this project is to develop and demonstrate an intelligent hemispherical Situational Awareness (SA) system for armored vehicles. The SA system will provide a high resolution, low latency view of the scene around the vehicle. The view provided is equivalent to a soldier being able to look out of a clear dome in the top of the vehicle. During Phase-II, we will demonstrate the proposed SA systems real-time computing architecture, user-interface, and implement the algorithms required to facilitate image stabilization, image stitching, high dynamic range image capture, low latency blast detection, etc. Each of these algorithms have already been demonstrated off-line (i.e., post processing) during Phase-I. The SA systems hardware is based around low-cost consumer mobile cameras and processors. The amazing capabilities and low size, weight, power, and cost of these devices has allowed us to propose a novel and intelligent computing architecture that can take advantage of built-in hardware (i.e., cameras and other sensing hardware) redundancy. Hardware redundancy makes the SA system extremely robust&quot;even when operating in a harsh combat environment. In addition, redundancy reduces maintenance cost and makes the system repairable in field with no need to ship back to depot.",

        "abstract": "Most munitions use organic explosives to produce effects that produce damage to critical components of the target. Organic explosives must be used in a narrow range of density and produce peak pressures far above what is required to damage the target. Hybrid energetic materials can be formulated to sustain reactions at very low density over large volumes to produce a wide range of effects from very low to very high pressures. By increasing volume with a constant mass of material, it is possible to produce a very large total pressure impulse. Pressure impulse is the major damage mechanism for a wide range of military targets. In addition, the inorganic components of hybrid energetic materials are capable of producing much higher specific energy than conventional organic explosives. The attributes of hybrid energetic material have not been exploited because of material availability and cost. This is partly ameliorated by improved production methods and the use of precision weapons that minimize the number of munitions needed to reach the desired effects. The proposed work will apply the weaponization and experimental methods defined and developed in the Phase I effort to the definition, design, and development of a hybrid energetic material system munition concept. Such a munition will provide our war fighters with the additional flexibility of a high impulse, low collateral damage weapon with effects tailored by varying the density of the energetic at the time of initiation. Potentially, such a weapon will reduce the munition mass needed to defeat a given target.    Commercial applications include demolition and pyrotechnic systems. High-density versions could also be used in metal brazing and welding applications.",

        "abstract": "Roadside IED&#039;s are expected to be a significant tool in our enemy&quot;s arsenal for years to come. They are the tool of choice since they are cheap, low cost and require very little skill to develop and deploy. Thus, there is a compelling unmet need for a directed energy device that can reliably and rapidly neutralize buried IEDs over large areas. The existing IED defeat systems are based on HPM or lasers and they operate by concentrating power into a narrow coherent beam aimed at a potential buried target. Such directed energy systems are promising if one&quot;s mission is neutralization of a known device. But in the case of IEDs, there&#039;s a serious weakness in this approach! The very nature of the IED threat is that its location is unknown. SARA&quot;s approach counters this weakness by offering an effective wide area long range IED-defeating solution. SARA&quot;s concept is based on launching low frequency high energy two-dimensional surface waves, also known as Zenneck waves. The approach offers the compelling advantages of lower propagation losses, wide area coverage, through the ground penetration, and penetration through conductive shielding countermeasures.",

In Phase I, a proof-of-concept App was developed that used the GPS receiver, camera, and magnetometer embedded in the smartphone.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Applied Optimization, Inc. proposes to develop a prototype hardware and software system for concurrent collection of metric observations and single-point spectral brightness data. The concurrency will be attained by using all but a few percent of the CCD pixel array for metric observations and the balance for collecting spectral data. A filter micro-array (or, micro-filter) will be positioned above the CCD focal plane such that it covers a chosen sub-array of pixels. The micro-filter is intended to be stationary and thus no filter wheel or filter tray would be necessary in an operational system. The proposed system will have ability to perform in-frame photometric calibration based on the reference stars that come serendipitously into the FOV of the pixels covered by the micro-filter. When closely-spaced objects (CSO) or cross-tagged objects (CTO) are encountered, the telescope may be boresighted such that the objects of interest appear within the FOV of the pixels covered by the micro-filter in order to collect their spectral brightness while the remaining pixels continue to collect metrics data. Due to such a blended collection of metric and spectral data, the OPS efficiency of the metrics mission will not be compromised. The prototype hardware will be implemented on systems that emulate GEODSS and SBSS. Back-end processing for RSO characterization and discrimination will be performed on the collected data for CSOs and CTOs in order to develop a metric of success for the data collection and its analysis.  BENEFIT:  Benefits: (1) Enable routine collection of spectral data with negligible impact on the operational efficiency of a SSN sensor for metrics data collection. (2) Eliminate moving components such as a filter wheel or filter tray and thereby eliminate the possibility of malfunction. (3) Enable simultaneous collection of spectral brightness data for a cluster of CSOs and its analysis for RSO discrimination at the sensor in order improve the quality of the catalog. Applications: (1) Software for data reduction, panchromatic and spectral brightness determination, and RSO discrimination using SSN data (2) Hardware for low-cost concurrent collection of metric observations and spectral data using COTS systems.",

Nanoscale thermite compositions are of interest because of their fast reaction rates and high flame temperatures. Unfortunately, in many cases, the materials are so reactive that they are impractical to work with. One route to improving ESD insensitivity is to embed the nanoparticles in a polymeric matrix, which insulates the particles from accidental discharge. However, significant challenges exist with traditional polymeric nanocomposite processing in achieving size similar particles with uniform dispersion and avoiding agglomeration, while making material in large enough quantity to be commercially useful. These challenges only increase with larger batch sizes, making production scale-up another significant challenge. In Phase I, Cornerstone Research Group Inc. (CRG) developed polymeric nanothermite composites using a novel, patented process called nanoinfusion yielding monodisperse nanoparticles of aluminum and iron oxide in an inert polymer binder. There is no route for particle agglomeration in this process, eliminating the most significant challenge associated with nanoparticle synthesis and mixing.

The requirement to perform over a broad bandwidth encompassing the entire UV and visible spectra motivates an all-reflective microscope objective solution. Commercially available all-reflective microscope objectives are based on a two mirror aberration-free system introduced by Karl Schwarzschild. The Schwarzschild microscope objective yields an all-reflective aberration-free solution for conventional compound light microscopes; however, it cannot achieve the numerical apertures or sub-micron spot sizes required for confocal microscope applications. An opportunity exists to fabricate, demonstrate and commercialize a broadband, low-dispersion confocal objective that can achieve the requisite numerical apertures and spot sizes for sub-micron imaging.

A 48 month period of performance is proposed consisting of one 12 month base period, with three subsequent 12 month options. Instrument operation and functionality will first be proven in an Engineering Development Test utilizing impulsive sources as surrogates for projectile impacts in a deep water environment representative of missile test areas. Using the data collected during this test, the impact detection and localization algorithms will then be demonstrated. The advantage of this approach is that the instruments can be tested without any disruption to missile test operations and the signal processing and localization algorithms can be demonstrated with unclassified data.",

Designing propulsion devices and munitions for precise operational performance demands comprehensive understanding and manipulation of the spatial and temporal distributions of energy release in activated energetic materials. A key aspect of modeling energy deposition from activated HEs is that the fundamental mechanisms of energy release manifest at the scale corresponding to particle sizes (typically tens of microns in size). Therefore, control and manipulation of energetic material performance in a macro-scale system requires understanding, modeling and prediction of its behavior at the mesoscale. The key features of the work are: (a) large-scale simulations of the dynamics and energetics of meso-structures under varying conditions of mechanical loading.; (b) accurate modeling of the material properties of the components of the HE; (c) realistic portrayal of meso-structural details in terms of geometry and composition; (d) the model should provide physical understanding and predictive capabilities that can be translated into quantitative information that can be used to represent meso-scale dynamics in a macro-scale simulation of the overall performance of an explosive/propellant.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The challenges in the operations of small unmanned aircraft systems (SUAS) and micro air vehicles (MAVs) in terms of required agility and benign flying qualities require a superior understanding of their basic flight mechanics and vehicle dynamics. Flight test data for MAVs are sparse, and wind tunnel unsteady aerodynamic data of MAVs with flexible wing structures are non-existent. Although progress has been made in the last decade, reliable MAV characterization requires the validation and support of experimental testing.  The core component of the proposed project is the design of the robotic arm for accurate six degree-of-freedom (DOF) motions of a MAV in a wind tunnel with position and force/moment feedback. The proposed six-DOF apparatus will give the research community the possibility to explore new experimental boundaries; support ongoing numerical modeling on low speed aerodynamics, unsteady flight dynamics, and bio-inspired flight techniques; develop innovative control systems for highly flexible and articulated flying structures, and validate novel navigation algorithms. The resulting experimental apparatus will be especially beneficial to the Air Force Office of Scientific Research and the AFRL by presenting dedicated instrumentation to be jointly used by researchers from different organizations.  BENEFIT:  The proposed six-DOF motion test apparatus will give to the research community the possibility to explore new experimental boundaries in supporting ongoing numerical modeling for low-speed aerodynamics, unsteady flight dynamics, bio-inspired flight techniques, innovative control systems for highly flexible and articulated flying structures, and for validating novel navigation algorithms. The proposed test apparatus addresses important strategic needs from the Department of Defense in miniature autonomous air vehicle basic research and experimental capabilities.  Other potential applications for the six-DOF device are wind tunnel simulation tests of wing load separation, highly dynamic motions, guidance and control research on biological specimens (e.g. hawkmoths, bees and dragonflies), and dynamics effects on propulsion systems (rotors, propellers and flapping wings). The civilian research community will also extract benefits from the proposed research on flight dynamics and aerodynamic unsteadiness and related experimental techniques.  In particular the following applications are envisioned:   Experiments on the interaction between unsteady flow and the flexibility of miniature structures could improve the design of micro-disposable fliers for agricultural applications (artificial pollination).   High-DOF simulations can help research on high speed reentry dynamics for space missions.   The six-DOF device could be used to improve the level of flight capabilities and safety of educational flight simulators and scientific toys.",

The VRE Channel Emulation impairs signals delivered between SUT radios, and between SUT radios and Virtual Radios, in a manner that reflects (in real-time) the realistic aggregate effects induced by the simulated environment on the signals being transmitted between those systems, in scenarios with large numbers of nodes. Our VRE Channel Emulation methodology is to recreate the bit error rate (BER) and bit error burst characterization (BEBC) induced by emulated channel conditions on the digital bit-streams that are encoded in the radio signals being transmitted between radios.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death among children in the United States. Child safety seats provide protection and have been observed to reduce death and injury rates by more than 70% when properly used. Studies have observed that only 10% to 20% of children are correctly harnessed into correctly installed seats. One of the most common errors involves the installation of the child safety seat in the vehicle. Child safety seats are installed using the vehicle seat belt or an independent Lower Anchors and Tethers for Children (LATCH) strap sold with the seat. The LATCH system is designed to make installation of child safety seats easier by providing a strap with the seat and two lower anchors in the vehicleonto which a child seat is attached. The vehicle seat belt or flexible LATCH seat anchor strap must be aggressively tensioned to achieve proper installation. The most common error associated with LATCH installations has been observed to be a loose lower anchor strap, which was observed in 30% of installations. Loose anchor straps increase the relative movement between the child safety seat and the vehicle in a crash thereby reducing the effectiveness of the seat at controlling the child&#039;s deceleration andincreasing the impact of the child, in particular of the head, with the vehicle interior, seat, or harness. This project will develop an inexpensive device to ensure that child safety seat anchor straps are properly installed.            PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The societal benefit of the proposed device is that, if successful, it will inexpensively and easily improve the safety of all LATCH system child safety seats by reducing the prevalence of anchor strap under tensioning. The population of interest for this device is virtually all child safety seat installers/users, which includes parents, grandparents, and child care providers. The available market for the proposed device exceeds 5 million units annually in the U.S. alone. There are approximately 30 million children 6 years old and younger in the U.S. By law, children in this age group must be restrained in a child safety seat. The proposed device provides benefit in nearly all of these seat installations.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION: The overall project goal is to develop sorbents that remove catalytic metals used in drug synthesis, which if not adequately removed between synthetic steps and from the final active pharmaceutical ingredients, can lead to toxic side-effects.Sorbents are being designed to meet new U.S. Pharmacopeia and international standards to be implemented in September, 2013. Goals are to remove catalytic metals and especially palladium to lt 5ppmw for oral medications and lt 0.5ppmw for parenteral medications. While homogeneous catalysts using Pd and other Pt-group metals have revolutionized drug development, these organo-metallic compounds are extremely toxic, producing neurological effects similar to those induced by methyl mercury and tetraethyl lead. The molecular mechanisms of this toxicity are similar to the side-effects induced by the anti-cancer agents, cis- platin, carboplatin and their cis-palladium analogues which bind strongly to both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, block transcription of critical neural enzymes and bind to active sites of enzymes that are critical for energy metabolism in the brain. Homogeneous organo-metallic catalysts readily cross the blood-brain barrier especially when designed with lipophilic ligands that allow very rapid transport through lipid membranes of the nervous system analogous to transport of methyl mercury and tetraethyl lead. Drug synthesis may involve numerous catalytic steps, and the catalytic metals should be removed after each step, as well as from the final product. If catalysts are not removed after each step, they may catalyze in subsequent steps formation of cytotoxic organic side-products, not easily separated from the target drug molecules. In addition, homogeneous catalysts can degrade, forming new coordination compounds, cluster compounds and nano- suspensions, which if not removed, may also catalyze additional side-reactions. These toxic-metal degredation products must also be removed from the final drug product. To remove a wide variety of metal contaminants, porous carbons are being scientifically designed with a unique pore distribution to trap bulky coordination complexes, cluster compounds and nanoparticles that are not easily removed by conventional filtration, centrifugation or metal scavengers. In addition, the carbons are functionalized to bind palladium compounds contaminating pharmaceuticals. Sorbents tested in Phase I lowered Pd concentrations to 0.20 ppmw for a Suzuki Coupling Reaction and 0.90 ppmw for a Heck Coupling Reaction. In Phase II we will work towards creation of a product line of new carbon sorbents for the pharmaceutical industry. The carbons will be sold in canisters; pharmaceutical mixtures purified by eluting solutions through packed beds of the activated carbons.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many pharmaceuticals prescribed to tens-of-millions of patients are contaminated with toxic impurities originating from metal catalysts used during drug synthesis. Chronic use of medications contaminated with toxic metals can cause cumulative neurological damage similar to that produced by mercury, lead and other neurotoxic substances. Catalytic metals, if not removed between synthesis steps, catalyze in later steps production of organic side products, similar to target drug molecules that are difficult to separat and which induce additional toxic side-effects or which interfere with action of the drug molecules.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alcohol abuse and alcoholism (alcohol use disorders) are significant public health issues and represent one of the largest public health problems. In the United States alone, alcohol use disorders affect about 14 million people, costing approximately  184 billion a year due to lost wages, legal and medical costs from associated injuries and liver, cardiac, neoplastic, or infectious diseases. Even though elaborate psychosocial and psychotherapeutic approaches for the treatment of alcoholism have been developed, relapse rates after long- term treatment of alcoholism clearly exceed 50% and may occur even after decades of abstinence. So far, only three drugs have been approved for treatment in the United States: disulfuram, naltrexone and acamprosate. Disulfuram is useful for the short-term treatment of highly motivated and compliant patients, but there is no evidence it is effective in long-term therapy and it carries a risk of significant liver, cardiac, and nervous system toxicity if taken with alcohol. For both naltrexone and acamprosate, which cause a variety of side effects, compliance is generally low, with only about half of patients completing treatment with either drug. Clearly, there is an unmet need to develop moreeffective compounds with novel molecular targets due to lack of single &#039;unifying&#039; neurobiological theory to explain basic mechanisms of alcohol use disorders and, some different drugs with different targets have been tested. The current proposal is focusedon the development of a novel oral compound that acts as isoform specific inhibitor of the enzyme protein kinase C epsilon (PKCe), which has been demonstrated an ideal target for alcohol use disorders. The overall objective of this SBIR Phase II CompetingRenewal research plan is to advance the positive results of our prior Phase II program to enable development of the first oral- and CNS-active and isoform-selective PKCe inhibitor, VMD-2202 through an Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the FDAfor the treatment of alcohol use disorders. VMD-2202 is orally effective reducing excessive alcohol intake in established animal model without affecting water intake. It has reasonable in vivo safety profile without sedation or motor incoordination, a CNSside effect often seen in many CNS drugs. We now propose a three-year preclinical drug development project through IND submission to the FDA, under NIH SBIR Phase II Competing Renewal Awards at NIAAA. In the first year of this proposal, we intend to further test therapeutic potential of VMD-2202 in various phases of alcohol uses disorders with a battery of established preclinical rodent models. In parallel, we will perform further lead optimization on the VMD-2202-based novel chemical scaffold to select another lead analog compound as the back-up entity. In the second and third year, we will conduct IND-enabling studies for one chosen development candidate advanced from the first year, including evaluation of the safety and pharmacokinetic profile, GMP manufacture and GLP safety pharmacology and toxicology studies in two animal species, which are necessary for an IND application to the FDA. At the end of the third year of this grant project, we will write and assemble an IND package and submit it to the FDA.If the FDA accepts the IND application, we will shortly thereafter begin the Phase I human clinical trials.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Alcohol abuse and alcoholism (alcohol use disorders) are significant public health issues and represent one of the largest public health problems. In the United States alone, alcohol use disorders affect about 14 million people, costing approximately  184 billion a year due to lost wages, legal and medical costs.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Excessive alcohol use is associated with a range of serious and costly health, social, and economic consequences at the individual and societal level. This program of research serves as a venue by which to produce and test an innovative, science-based, and cost-effective means to intervene in a private, convenient, and individualized way with employed adults who report non-dependent levels of risky drinking. Responsible Drinking offers computer-tailored intervention sessions directed at increasing readiness to limit drinking to national guidelines for low-risk drinking and a complementary dynamic web portal providing additional information, activities, and strategies designed to activate and reinforce the change process.Both e-Health intervention components are stage-matched, individually tailored based on theoretically grounded behavior change strategies, and designed to be interactive and engaging. Mobile health (m-Health) technologies, including theoretically tailoredand stage-matched text messaging and mobile device browsing optimization, will be integrated to support the behavior change process, engagement in the program, and convenient delivery. The successful completion of Phase I demonstrates that Responsible Drinking is acceptable to risky drinkers, capable of producing intention to make behavior changes, and feasible to disseminate via the Internet to employed adults. The primary goals of Phase II are to complete and enhance the development of the e- Health intervention components, to add m-Health technologies, and to assess the effectiveness in a randomized clinical trial involving 614 employed adults who exceed low-risk drinking levels. This application offers innovation through offering a population-based approach, a sophisticated level of tailoring on theoretically grounded constructs, and combining e-Health and m-Health technologies. An evidence-based secondary prevention program will offer tremendous commercial benefit to help employers, insurers, disease management, and wellness companies reduce the financial, personal, and societal costs of excessive alcohol use.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Given the range and severity of health, social, and economic consequences of excessive alcohol use, promoting responsible drinking among non-dependent drinkers is of great public health importance. This research proposes to develop and test an Internet-based, individualized, and interactive program for employed adults who exceed the national guidelines for low-risk drinking. With a theoretical and science-based foundation and a cost-effective and easily deliverable platform, this intervention offers great promise to improve the health and well-being of populations of risky drinkers.",

PMAF is a community-based program designed to train groups of youth to a) represent contributing factors and consequences (e.g., social availability, alcohol-involved crashes) of underage drinking in their communities through a specific photographic technique called photovoice, and b) use photo projects to raise community awareness and motivate community-level change. Underage drinking continues to be serious public health concern in this country. This is reflected in the recent Call to Action by the U.S. Surgeon General&#039;s Office (2007) which places an emphasis on youth involvement in community-wide prevention. However, there are few, if any, commercially available tools that can be used by communities to train and support youth in community-based prevention. The proposed project will fill that need by using existing research and instructional technology todevelop an innovative online training program that will guide youth, with the help of an adult facilitator, through the photovoice process in attempt to raise community awareness and motivate alcohol-related environmental and policy changes. Phase II aimsinclude completion of the full PMAF program and evaluation of the program using a pair- matched group randomized design.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed SBIR Phase II project aims at developing a new drug product, the naltrexone orally dissolving film (ODF), for treatment of alcohol dependence. The naltrexone ODF is a small, thin, and flexible film, containing naltrexone hydrochloride and other excipients. It is applied intra-orally and adheres to the oral mucosa to affect a rapid onset of action due to oral mucosal absorption, followed by an extended pharmacological action. The naltrexone ODF is administered 30 to 60 minutes prior to a drinking episode or as-needed when alcohol craving occurs. The naltrexone ODF is novel, cost- effective, convenient to use, dissolves in the mouth without the need for water and fills the  gaps of current treatment regimens and market needs. Phase I of this project was highly successful wherein the specific aims were met in demonstrating the feasibility of developing a prototype naltrexone ODF formulation which met the targeted milestone having optimal functional properties. The Phase II program will extend to product development/ early-commercialization phase by validating the prototype formulation with IND-enabling safety studies, technology transfer and scale-up and manufacturing of clinical supplies. PROBLEM/OPPORTUNITY: Naltrexone is an approved drug for treatment of alcohol and opioid dependence. There are two naltrexone drug products marketed for treatment of alcohol dependence: oral tablets and injectable depot formulation. The former suffers from low bioavailability, poor patient compliance, and significant side effects. The later overcomes bioavailability and patient compliance issues but is expensive, inconvenient and has injection site reaction. The proposed naltrexone ODF drug product is expected to overcome the poororal bioavailability of the oral naltrexone tablets, and the high cost and inconvenience of the injectable naltrexone depot formulations. The alcohol dependence medication market sector is under-served and has substantial potential. The proposed ODF technology could be extended and developed into improved dosage forms for other drugs targeted at treatment of substance-addiction. PLAN OUTLINE: The aims of this proposed SBIR Phase II program on the naltrexone ODF are to: 1) manufacture preclinical supplies, 2) conduct preclinical studies, 3) technology transfer, scale-up and manufacture Phase 1 clinical supplies, and 4) prepare regulatory (CMC) documentation for a pre-IND (Investigational New Drug) meeting. Upon successful completion of this program, a SBIR Phase III follow-up program is proposed that will include filing of IND and conducting the Phase I clinical safety/proof-of-concept study.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed new product, naltrexone orally dissolving film (ODF), is expected to result in improved efficacy and better compliance in the pharmacological therapies for alcohol dependence. This will reduce the public health burden of heavy drinking to our society and significantly reduce related healthcare costs. In addition, the proposedtechnology is a platform that could be extended and developed into improved dosage forms for other substance abuse medications.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alcoholic and non-alcoholic liver fibrosis remains an unsolved challenge for the hepatologist as it can lead to cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease, a life-threatening condition that necessitates liver transplantation. Current therapeutic strategies for the treatment of liver fibrosis include changes in diet, life-style and/or medications to allevate the underlying cause of disease. Since liver disease is typically diagnosed following significant scar formation, adjuvant strategies that oppose the molecular and cellular program of fibrosis that drives liver disease and activate matrix degrading pathways are urgently required. A preponderance of preclinical data in models of fibrotic liver disease speaks to collagen catabolizing activity of endogenous peptide hormone Relaxin (H2R). Translation of these findings into clinical regimen has been painfully slow in large part due to the costs and logistica difficulties associated with commercial production of recombinant human(rh) H2R. Using molecular modeling-and medicinal chemistry-based drug design, Angion Biomedica has developed a library of single chain, short length H2R-like peptides that can be chemically synthesized and potentially offer multiple clinico-commercial advantages over rhH2R therapy. SBIR Phase I studies have identified a lead antifibrotic candidate, ANG-4011, from within this library, that has excellent drug-like properties and is therapeutic in multiple preclinical models f renal and hepatic fibrosis, opposing matrix deposition in kidney and liver. In partnership with the  internationally recognized laboratory of Prof. Kathryn Uhrich (Rutgers University, NJ), and representing a landmark step in sustained in vivo delivery of peptides, we have developed a clinically compatible, biodegradable, microsphere-based extended release formulation for ANG-4011. The proposed milestone-driven SBIR Phase II study is designed to make a comprehensive evaluation of our lead candidate in preclinical models of liver fibrosis while optimizing its delivery. Data from this SBIR Phase II program will allow for entry of this lead candidate to the preclinical safety/toxicology battery to be completed under the aegis of the SBIR Phase IIb competing renewal mechanism. The ultimate objective of this program is to bring an H2R-like antifibrotic to clinical trials for treatment of liver fibrosis.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Liver fibrosis is associated with significant morbidity and mortality and is one of the largest markets of unmetmedical need. Development of an antifibrotic for treatment of this disease is of tremendous clinical significance.",

Derived from recommendations contained in the Report on Best Practices for Responsible Retailing, prepared as a federal guidance document for the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention in 2002, the model employs a quality improvement approach to assist retailers improve age-verification. In test communities, the model has shown significant promise as a way ofimproving ID-checking and underage sales refusal. Phase I focus groups indicated that alcohol regulators, retailers, their associations and suppliers all support the RRF model for a community-based RR system providing licensees with RR resources and feedback on actual staff performance in checking IDs, and a cooperative, problem-solving approach to underage alcohol sales and use. The proposed study will employ a randomized cross-over design to examine the effects of the RRF model upon ID-checking behaviorby alcohol beverage licensees. The project will:  7 Identify 2 pairs of demographically matched communities in each of 4 states: CA, MA, NM, WI  7 Identify and randomly select alcohol licensees in each community and recruit 15 on-premise licensees  (that serve alcohol on-premises) and 15 off-premise licensees (that sell for off-premises consumption)  7 Conduct pretest and posttest surveys with licensees and public agency stakeholders on attitudes and  perceptions on underage alcohol sales and use and stakeholder roles in their communities  7 Conduct 3 monthly Mystery Shop inspections by young, legal-age inspectors who attempt to purchase  an alcohol beverage to establish baseline ID-checking performance  7 Randomly assign one community in each pair to receive the 6-month intervention immediately (Cohort  1) and the other to a delayed intervention 6 months later (Cohort 2). During the first intervention period, outlets in Cohort 1 will receive the retailer assistance intervention, including monthly Mystery Shop  visits with feedback after each visit. Outlets in Cohort 2 will receive Mystery Shop visits during  intervention period 1 to document ID-checking rates but will not receive feedback or any assistance  7 During the second intervention period, conduct theretailer assistance intervention with outlets in Cohort  2. Cohort 1 outlets will no longer receive any other assistance during this time but unreported Mystery Shop inspections will continue in order to investigate decay of effects. We expect ID-checkingrates will increase significantly in Cohort 1 communities, relative to Cohort 2, during the first 6 months of the intervention. ID-checking rates in Cohort 2 will similarly increase once the RR intervention is implemented in those communities in months 7-12. We also expect ID-checking rates to gradually decay to baseline levels in Cohort 1 communities during months 7-12. This finding will help make the business case to retailers for a long-term commitment to the RRF model.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:Responsible Retailing Program for Alcohol Retailers.

Methods of surveying this population and gathering longitudinal data regarding aspects of their lives, such as activity level sleep patterns, physiological data, and behavior patterns are needed and have been highlighted as an area of interest by the National Institute of Aging. Such data are not only useful to academic researchers, but to insurers, health care providers, health and health policy analysts and, on amore intimate level, by caregivers. However, cost and adherence play key roles in the ability to collect such data, so an easy-to-use, low-cost automatic data collection system is required; one which can and will be utilized by the elderly on a regular basis and which is capable of capturing a wide range of key health indicators. This Phase II application aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of a portable and real-time survey system capable of collecting activity level, location, and sleep patterns on a continual basis from a wrist-based device in a watch form factor, as well as physiological data such as blood pressure and weight from easy-to-use wireless devices, and self-reported data from easy, touch-screen interfaces regarding a number of varying topics including pain level, diet and nutrition, or stress. The application aims to prove the following hypothesis: The proposed monitoring system provides an effective means of collecting real-time survey data (including physiological, activity, sleep, and self- report dat) from elderly individuals for an extended period of time and is capable of recognizing deviations from individualized baseline norms that could be indicative of illness or need for intervention. During the study, 30 reasonably healthy elderlyindividuals and 60 elderly individuals with congestive heart failure (CHF) will be monitored over six months, during which a number of episodes of acute CHF exacerbation are expected to occur; the system will learn to recognize and alert upon such episodes. CHF was chosen so that the effectiveness of the system in flagging deviations from an individual&#039;s system-learned baseline could be better demonstrated. All study participants will be monitored by a visiting nurse/physician once each week. Moreover, 30of the CHF participants and the 30 other participants will also be monitored using the proposed system configured to provide real-time data to the nurse in charge of each participant. The specific aims of the project will be to establish that: 1) the platform can and will be used by  an elderly population for an extended (six-month) period of time, 2) the watch device is effective for collecting longitudinal sleep and activity data, and 3) the system is effective in providing useful survey data to monitoring nurses while reducing the burden of care.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The objective is to design, build, and clinically assess ParkinStep, an innovative neurotechnology that integrates wireless motion sensing, automated home-based Parkinson&#039;s disease (PD) gait and balance assessment, anddeep brain stimulation (DBS) parameter estimation using a web-based database model to integrate data across clinical centers. Following DBS surgery, programming of stimulation settings is performed in the clinic to optimize treatment effectiveness. Upperextremity motor symptoms such as tremor, bradykinesia (slowed movements), and rigidity are typically evaluated in response to DBS settings. Although gait and balance are critical components to quality of life measures and lower extremity dysfunction can bedisabling, current in-clinic evaluations are limited. The time required for stimulation to fully impact gait and balance may exceed the typical time of a programming session. While the effect of DBS on tremor may be almost immediate, obtaining feedback onstimulation effectiveness, gait and balance may require in excess of three hours when stimulation settings are adjusted. From a programming standpoint, the effect of stimulation settings on gait and balance is less understood than with other motor symptoms, possibly due to the complex motor circuits involved in gait. ParkinStep will address these concerns through home monitoring to fully capture the effect of stimulation and possible fluctuations experienced throughout the day. In addition, the patient data collected during home tests will be continuously compiled into an online HIPAA-compliant database to automatically output suggested stimulation settings. Therefore, clinicians, independent of geographic location or programming experience, will have access to this service for improved DBS programming outcomes of gait and balance. The clinical system resulting from Phase II development will 1) allow high compliance home monitoring of PD gait and balance symptoms in response to DBS, 2) allow clinicians to optimize PD response to DBS using a stimulation parameter estimation model, and 3) address geographic disparities of patient clinical access to evaluate gait and balance impairment. This will be achieved by modifying our existing Kinesia HomeView system forlower extremity wear and high compliance in the home settings. The system will be evaluated in a multi-center clinical study to populate the online database to train the DBS parameter estimation model. Finally, the developed model will be used in a clinical impact study to determine whether the ParkinStep system can achieve improved gait and balance response to DBS over traditional methods.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Fall risk associated with gait and balance impairment in Parkinson&#039;s disease (PD) patients can cause significant disability and negatively affect quality of  life. Programming of deep brain stimulation (DBS) parameters to treat PD gait and balance symptoms is significantly more challenging than for other symptoms including tremor and bradykinesia.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Falls and fall-related injuries in seniors are more common than strokes and can have equally serious consequences; they represent a signicant health care problem with a substantial associated morbidity and reduction inoverall mobility and function. Thirty percent of adults 65 years and older fall each year, often suering dangerous closed head injury and long bone fractures. Fall-related injuries are the number one reason for emergency room visits and the leading cause of injury-related deaths among elderly adults. Studies have shown that half of elderly fallers cannot get up without assistance after they have fallen, often lying in anxiety and/or pain for far too long until discovered.  The majority of eldes prefer to lead an independent lifestyle, with a minimum of caregiver intervention. Many seniors, however, are frail and suer from imbalance as a result of their health status; they are at risk for  falls and would benet from having a safety net in place.  Barron Associates proposes to develop the EverWrist fall monitoring system. The EverWrist will employ a novel, patent-protected paradigm to detect falls, and will automatically summon assistance by sending a wireless signal to a console unit that delivers an alert toa prioritized list of caregivers, ensuring that it is received by a human being. A button on the EverWrist monitor will also enable wearers to initiate personal emergency alert calls and to cancel an alert call in progress if assistance is no needed. Additionally, the EverWrist monitor will be able to detect and log near-fall events, which are of particular interest to health care personnel to identify individuals in need of further intervention to avoid future falls.  The majority of previously available commercial fall detectors  were waist-mounted; as such, they were not true all-day monitors, since they could not be worn comfortably during sleep and had to be removed to bathe or change clothes. The relatively large size of these fall monitors caused themto be conspicuous, resulting in very low adoption rates. Additionally, the fall detection algorithms used in nearly all previously-available devices were simplistic, leading to an unacceptably high rate of false alarms and/or missed detections.  To overcome the problems of earlier devices, a patent-pending sensing technique will be utilized in the EverWrist system that greatly improves accuracy and reliability in detecting falls. The new approach will be productized in the form of a commonly worn and socially acceptable accessory, making it discreet and unobtrusive to wear. A novel algorithmic methodology, motivated and supported by recent research, will be incorporated into the monitor to detect near-fall events and discriminate these events from actual falls and other activities of daily livig. The approach challenges existing paradigms for fall and near-fall event detection. The resulting EverWrist system will be well positioned in terms of market demand (i.e., need for an ergonomic monitor that can be worn 24/7).          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The EverWrist system will nd a market with three groups: (1) continuing-care retirement communities, where independent-living residents, in particular, are left relatively unsupervised, but often still have issues with mo- bility and balance; (2) direct sales to elderly individuals, the vast majority of whom wish to continue living independently, but who need to have a safety net in place; and (3) the adult children of elderly individuals, from whom there is a growing demand for monitoring systems that can increase their peace of mind. The availability of a noninvasive, 24-hour-a-day fall/personal alert monitor will make the EverWrist system attractive to a wide segment of elderly individuals and their families.  Marketing will focus on senior living communities immediately following Phase II. A rapid transition to commercialization is made possible through Barron Associates&#039; relationship with AFrame Digital, Inc (AFD). AFD is a provider of mobile, intelligent, cost-eective, health monitoring and alerting systems for multi-resident, outpatient, and military outpatient care settings with a strong record of commercial success in the area of telehealth monitoring.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Market potential exists for development of works of drama that can be performed in facilities providing care for persons with dementia, and which can involve such residents interactively. Therefore, the purpose of thisPhase 2 project is to refine two plays created in our Phase 1 SBIR (Life Is A Stage  : Dementia Care and the Dramatic Arts) that can be performed in residences serving persons with dementia, and to create two new plays for this purpose. Plays are designedto provide either a linear or non-linear structure. The linear structure is more narrative-based, with more fixed roles and settings. The non-linear structure relies more on spontaneous and improvisational approaches. In Phase 1, we found that persons withearly to moderate dementia were most engaged during the performance of the non-linear play, and those with more advanced dementia were more engaged during the linear play. In the alpha development stage of this Phase 2 grant, the original plays and two new plays (1 linear, 1 non-linear) will be performed in three different types of dementia care settings - Adult Day Care Centers, Assisted Living Facilities, and Special Care Units (SCUs) of long-term care facilities - by acting students used in Phase 1 in two of each type of setting in two geographic areas: the Greater New York City area and in the Greater Boston area. In each specific setting, a linear and a non-linear play will be performed. In the beta development stage, our experiences in the alpha development stage will result in revisions of the four plays. In addition, all scripts, props, instructions (including a DVD showing performances and how to stage the plays) will come out of a package (we call it the   Drama Box  ) that Program and Activity Directors would use to put on their own interactive drama programs with clients and residents. All 4 plays in one of each type of dementia care setting will be performed in the Greater Boston area. This product will then be tested in a similar way in one of each type of dementia care setting in the Greater Cleveland, Ohio area. The objectives of the Phase 2 project are: 1) To create use our experience from Phase 1 to revise two interactive plays for persons with dementia developed in Phase 1 and to create 2 new interactive plays; 2) To assess whether the type of play - linear or non-linear - differentially affects persons with dementia and their caregivers; 3) To determine if engagement is differentially affected by standard programming versus taking part in aplay in residents with dementia; 4) To determine if perceptions of dementia and capabilities of persons with dementia, along with quality of life measures, change across time after performances; 5) To assess whether there are differences in the effects produced by the plays across different residential settings and resident samples; 6) To determine if effects produced when plays are performed by actors can be replicated when performances are supervised by activity staff using the beta version of Life Is A Stage  ; and 7) To use our experience in the Phase 2 project to create a final, market ready version of the product.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This Phase 2 SBIR project, titled Life Is A Stage  : Dementia Care and the Dramatic Arts,   involves creation of four plays that will enable persons with dementia in a variety of care settings to take part in improvisational theatre. Based on a similar program called   Ladder to the Moon   developed in the UK, we will document the positive effects for persons with dementia when they are provided with a chance to take part in dramatic arts.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this project is to develop an open and flexible imaging platform capable of rapid, 0.5- 5  m pixel resolution image capture of large-area histology sections (up to 125 mm by 175 mm), in brightfield and by epi-fluorescence optical sectioning. The project involves state-of-the- art instrumentation development coupled with application programming interfaces (APIs) to provide users with a reliable, multi-purpose research instrument. The development of a high speed large format imaging system will dramatically accelerate investigations such as amyloid protein studies for Alzheimer&#039;s disease or the expression of immediate-early genes (IEG) in understanding of the cellular basis of cognition. The number of digital-imaging system options decreases dramatically as the size of histology sections outgrows 1   W 3   glass slides. Further, because the current vendors are concentrating on digitizing anatomic pathology, their systems tend to be closed and inflexible to accommodate the regulatory constraints on medical devices. The market opportunity that DMetrix has identified is a robust and reliable commercial imaging platform with the flexibility and customization options valued by research groups. The project is divided into two Phases, punctuated by a demonstration of quantitative criteria, related to instrument and software performance. The primary goal of Phase I is the demonstration of feasibility of the large-area, rapid imaging instrument for brightfield and epi-fluorescence. A second goal is an image-viewer application that allows practical interaction with terabyte image data sets as will be generated by the instrument. The Specific Aims of Phase II are selected to lead to a product launch at the conclusion of the project. The Phase II Aims include the development of a   V6,   six-imaging-module slide scanner, image- management software, and an advanced image-viewer application. Further, the work in Phase II leverages the core expertise of DMetrix, namely the development of fast, parallel image-capture instruments. A significant part of the Phase II effort will be directed at making the proposed instrument manufacturable at a minimum cost of goods sold (COGS) and optimized for serviceability. DMetrix has teamed on thisproject with an interdisciplinary group of academic experts from the University of Arizona. The University team includes Dr. Carol Barnes from the McKnight Brain Institute, Dr. Ted Trouard, Department of Radiology and Biomedical Engineering, and Dr. GeneAlexander, Director of the Brain Imaging, Behavior and Aging Lab in the Department of Psychology. These University of Arizona scientists represent a diverse sampling of the broad impact of the proposed imaging platform on neuroscience research.      PUBLICHEALTH RELEVANCE: Understanding the circuits in the brain responsible for cognition, emotion and action is a critical first step to developing treatments for important neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer&#039;s disease, Parkinson&#039;s disease, temporal lobeepilepsy, depression, and schizophrenia. Collectively, these disorders affect over 20 million Americans. Our long-range goal is to develop a system that has wide application across the field of neuroscience that will enable experiments impeded in the pastby technological limitations, to span mouse models of disease to rat and nonhuman primate models of normal aging. This knowledge may bring us closer to optimizing neural function in health, and developing new therapies for patients disabled by neurological disease.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this Phase II SBIR, Actuated Medical, Inc. (f/k/a Piezo Resonance Innovations, Inc) will complete the development of the Resonance Assisted Insertion Lancet (RAIL  ) System to reduce animal pain and stress response during laboratory animal blood sampling. Public Health Problem: Understanding the physiological and biological mechanisms of aging is the focus of much research. Longitudinal rodent studies provide significant insights into the general aging process and age-related topics such as nutrition, behavior, immunology, cancer, and neurobiology. To avoid the problem of elevated stress hormones influencing blood chemistry, cross-sectional studies are often performed. These studies require many animals for each time-point, which is not only expensive in terms of animal use and cost, but limits the study of cause/effect relationships. New minimally-perturbing blood sampling strategies are highly desired to enable serial blood sampling over the lifespan. Phase I successfully developed Alpha prototypes, met the Specific Aims, and demonstrated that the RAIL device reduced insertion force by up to 68%. Blood samples obtained with the RAIL prototype had on average a 60% reduction in corticosterone level. The average variancein measurements was reduced by 71%. Response to the RAIL, from a focus group of nine (9) animal research scientists and veterinarians, was highly positive. Phase II will develop a commercially viable device that minimizes animal stress during serial bloodsamples, improving study results and eliminating the need for cross-sectional studies. Phase II Hypothesis: Vibrated venipuncture with RAIL device will reduce plasma corticosterone level by 60%   10% with decreased variability by 60%   10% compared to non-vibrated venipuncture in a 24-month longitudinal repeat sampling study in mice (plt 0.05). Phase II Specific Aims:  1. Demonstrate that RAIL device offers similar reduction of corticosterone release in mice as that seen previously in rats.  2. Demonstratewidespread applicability of RAIL device to lower corticosterone levels in blood sampled at alternate anatomic locations.  3. Quantify the performance advantage of RAIL device in serial blood sampling experiment over the lifespan (24 Month Study in Mice).4. Finalize device design and build 60 units, tested and ready for market release.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Understanding the physiological and biological mechanisms of aging and the role hormones play in healthy and abnormal aging continues to be the focus of much research. Studies of hormone levels in rodent models have been critical to this effort, but the effect of the stress associated with traditional blood sampling techniques is problematic. New minimally-perturbing blood sampling strategies, such as the device to be developed here, are highly desired to enable serial blood sampling over the lifespan to better explore links between changing hormone levels and the aging process, while reducing the number of animals required for the study.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer&#039;s disease and related disorders (ADRD) constitute urgent challenges to U.S. healthcare systems as well as enormous burdens on society as a whole. Nearly 75 percent of the care for persons with ADRD is delivered at home, and family caregivers need ongoing support to manage the daunting physical and psychological demands of care. A 20+ year randomized controlled trial tested a psychosocial intervention for spouse caregivers, called the NYU Caregiver Intervention(NYUCI), and demonstrated long-term positive outcomes for people with ADRD and their family members. Most notably, the RCT showed that the NYUCI substantially reduced caregiver&#039;s depressive symptoms and the severity of their reaction to the behaviors caused by the illness, improved their physical health, and extended the time persons with ADRD were able to remain at home-an average of 1.5 years longer than those whose caregivers received usual care (Mittelman et al., AG14634, formerly MH42216; See www.nrepp.samhsa.gov/programfulldetails.asp?PROGRAM_ID=122). This Phase II effort proposes to complete and evaluate an innovative Internet-Based Multimedia Education (IBME) training program for providers in community agencies and private practice seeking to learn how to implement the NYUCI or become more proficient in counseling family caregivers of people with dementia. Certification and continuing education credits will be part of the product. Requests for training have become too numerous to satisfy in a timely manner in person. We hypothesize the proposed effort can provide effective training with the aid of the Internet so that fidelity to the NYUCI content, protocols, and outcomes can be achieved efficiently. We will test this hypothesis in YR2 with a randomized controlled trial that will inclue both quantitative analyses and qualitative evaluations, comparing the results of in person training and on-line training using the completed product. Because NYUCI assures support to family caregivers for the life of those with ADRD, the proposed IBME has the potential to transform ADRD home care but also U.S. healthcare systems as it disseminates access to the evidence-based NYUCI model to many more agencies than would be possible without an IBME format. The project&#039;s innovation derives from a unique vision, multilevel intervention, and creative combination of the NYUCI itself, the professional experience of the Investigators and other key personnel in the fields of family care, ADRD, and IBME development. In addition toits strong present commercial potential, this IBME may be also useful as a template for future training of providers of caregiving support to persons with chronic diseases other than ADRD.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This Phase II effort completes and evaluates an Internet-based training for social service providers implementing the evidence-based New York University Caregiver Intervention (NYUCI) model, a psychosocial intervention for families of those with Alzheimer&#039;s disease (AD). This effort is highly relevant to U.S. public health because the NYUCI has been shown to reduce depression in caregivers and delay nursing home placement by 1.5 years, on average. Widespread implementation of the NYUCI model, to be facilitated by the proposed training andcertification program, could support the 10.9 million family caregivers delivering nearly 75 percent of the home care for those with AD (Alzheimer&#039;s Association: 2010 Alzheimer&#039;s Disease Facts and Figures) as well as potentially saving the health care system hundreds of millions of dollars.",

One approach that has been shown to be effective involves the use of Montessori Activity Programming (MAP). This study will involve the further development and refinement an innovative MAP activity called the Hearthside Book ClubTM (HBC), which will be the first-ever dementia-level appropriate reading materials. For each of 32 topics, four different versions of a story/essay will be created. Developed for persons in the early stages of dementia,   A- Grade Level Reading Materials   will be 30 pages in length and be written at an 9th grade level;   AA-Grade Level Reading Materials  , developed for persons in the Middle Stages of dementia, will be 25 pages in length and will be written at the 6th grade level;   AAA-Grade Level Stories  , created for persons in the Late Stages of Dementia, will be 20 pages in length, and will be written at the 4th grade level; finally,   AAAA  Grade Level Stories  , created for persons in the Very Late Stages of Dementia, will be 15 pages in length, and be written at the 3rd grade level. So, a total of 128 stories will be created for ths study. Half of the stories will contain pictures. A total of 120 older adults with dementia will participate in the study. They will be assigned to one of four groups: the Early Stage Group (Mini-Mental Status Exam (MMSE) score of 18+), the Middle Stage Group (MMSE, 11-17), the Late Stage Group (MMSE, 5-10), or the Very Late Stage Group (MMSElt 5). The engagement of persons taking part in HBC sessions will be compared against their engagement in standard, baseline activities. Engagement during HBC sessions will also be compared against engagement in Reading Roundtable(R) (RR) sessions. RR stories are designedfor persons with dementia, but are not adjusted for varying levels of dementia. Key proximal outcome measures include engagement and communication patterns; key distal outcome measures include quality of life, depression, and agitation. Distal measures will be taken at baseline, afte one month of RR sessions, after one month of HBC sessions without pictures, and after one month of HBC sessions with pictures. The Specific Aims of the study are: (1) to develop improved HBC stories based upon lessons learned in Phase 1; (2) to develop a enough number of HBC stories for two months of activity programming; (3) to develop HBC stories for persons with severely advanced dementia (MMSElt 5); (4) to implement reading groups at three types of facilities (nursing homes,assisted living facilities, and adult day centers); (5) to examine the proximal and distal effects of the reading groups; (6) to examine the effects of the reading groups on communication patterns of persons with dementia; (7) to examine whether the effects of the intervention varies among the three levels of care; and (8) to use results of the Phase 2 study to create a final, market-ready version of the product.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: An estimated 5.4 million Americans are currently suffering from Alzheimer&#039;s disease (AD), and AD cases are expected to rise at an alarming rate. Besides affecting the person with the condition, AD also presents a public health concern, due to the significant cost required to care for persons with dementia and due to the mental and physical stress placed upon caregivers of persons with dementia; so, there is an urgent need for products and programs that will engage and stimulate persons with dementia, while at the same time reducing the stress on caregivers. Throughthe development of special reading materials for persons of varying levels of dementia, the proposed project will help meet this need.",

Such real-time retinal imaging will also be critical for evaluationof various therapies for retinal pathology. Thus, patients susceptible to retinal disease could be diagnosed with 2PO and treated well before vision loss occurs.

Trials of PfSPZ Vaccine administered intravenously (IV) are now planned for the NIAID, NIH Vaccine Research Center, Bethesda, USA, and the Ifakara Health Institute (IHI) in Tanzania, and PfSPZ Challenge trials are planned for Tanzania, UK, USA, the Netherlands, Germany, and Switzerland, and PfSPZ Cvac (PfSPZ Challenge administered with chloroquine) in the Netherlands and USA. PySPZ studies in mice and data from in vitro assays with PfSPZ and PySPZ indicate potency of cryopreserved SPZ is 2.7 to 6-fold less than that of fresh SPZ. All of Sanaria&#039;s products rely on stabilization and cryopreservation of aseptic, purified PfSPZ. Improvements to stabilization/cryopreservation are critically important and when implemented will double the infectivity and potency of PfSPZ, reducing the cost of manufacturing and quality control release assays for lots of PfSPZ products by increasing the size of lots, and reducing vaccine loss/wastage in the clinic by prolonging the time after thawing that a vial of PfSPZ product can be used. Our goal is to reduce the costof goods (COGS) overall by at least 75%. Five Specific Aims encompass work to accomplish this goal: Aim 1. Reduce by 50% the numbers of PySPZ required to achieve 100% infection and 80% protective efficacy in vivo: In vitro assays and the in vivo infectivity (ID50) and protection against challenge are the readouts. Aim 2. Increase by 50% the infectivity and potency of cryopreserved PfSPZ: Methods developed Aim 1 will be applied to PfSPZ using a combination of in vitro assays for readouts. Aim 3. Establish in NHPs that PfSPZ, cryopreserved by methods optimized in Aims 1 and 2 as compared to PfSPZ manufactured using our current methods induce a significant increase in the frequency of INF-?-secreting CD8+ T cells when used to stimulate PBMCs from immunized NHPs in vitro and when used to immunize NHPs in vivo. Aim 4. Develop the capacity to create batches of in process PfSPZ material at multiple, defined intervals that can be combined into PfSPZ bulk product and then large lots of PfSPZ final product. The goal is to extend the process hold-time up to 6 days and to increase lot size to 180,000 doses. Aim 5. Extend PfSPZ survival in the clinic post-thaw and formulation: Cryopreserved, thawed PySPZ and PfSPZ in diluent formulations designed to extend in-clinic stability will be tested using in vivo and in vitro assay with the goal of increasing to a minimum of four hours, stability in the clinic.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: To protect individuals against malaria and to aid in eradicating this disease, a highlyeffective vaccine is needed, and Sanaria has developed a platform technology, manufactured from live Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites (PfSPZ), to make such a vaccine. Two products are in clinical development: a live attenuated whole organism vaccine called the PfSPZ Vaccine, and a live infectious vaccine administered with an antimalarial drug, a vaccine called PfSPZ-CVac. In addition Sanaria has developed a live, infectious PfSPZ product, PfSPZ Challenge, for use in testing malaria drugs and vaccines. Allthree products require cryopreservation for storage at low temperature. This proposal aims to increase the potency of cryopreserved PfSPZ, which will increase the efficiency of manufacturing and reduce the numbers of PfSPZ required in vaccine doses. Success in this project will greatly reduce cost of vaccine manufacture, thereby making the vaccine available more cheaply for travelers and developing world populations.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a well-recognized need to develop vaccines that stimulates humoral immunity as well as a potent T cell immunity in order to achieve protection from infection with pathogens. Although numerous investigations arefocused on developing vaccines that induce protective humoral responses, only a few studies are aimed towards developing specific T cell immunity for various infections, including dengue virus. The critical components for a successful vaccine, that provides protective T cell immunity, are the identity of specific T cell epitopes and an optimized vaccine delivery system that is capable of delivering the antigens and the adjuvants simultaneously. In the phase I of the project, we have successfully identifiedand characterized HLA-A2 (allele representing ~40% of the world population) specific conserved epitopes and have demonstrated the feasibility of epitope based vaccine for dengue infection. In the phase II of this project, we propose to extend the discovery process to identify epitopes specific for HLA- A24, the major HLA allele in Asian population and characterize both the HLA-A2 and A24 epitopes using PBL from dengue virus infected patient cohorts. In addition, we propose to characterize a vaccine formulation of these cross serotype conserved antigenic epitopes in a novel gold glyconanoparticle delivery system that incorporates Toll Like Receptor (TLR) agonist, a promiscuous synthetic T helper peptide from tetanus toxoid and the bacterial mimetic GlcNAc asadjuvants and assess in vitro and in vivo for CTL activation and toxicity to generate preclinical data. At the end of the phase II, we would have necessary preclinical data to file an IND for a pilot phase 0/I clinical evaluation of the muli-epitope-basedvaccine product that induces specific T cell responses against DV infection in HLA-A2 and A24 positive human subjects.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There is a well-recognized need to develop vaccines that stimulates humoral immunity as well as a potent T cell immunity in order to achieve protection from infection with pathogens. Although numerous investigations are focused on developing vaccines that induce protective humoral responses, only a few studies are aimed towards developing specific T cell immunity for various infections, including dengue virus, which causes Dengue Fever (DF) and Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF), a significant global public health problems.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For the Phase I SBIR grant we constructed a Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) 3D7 protein microarray containing 2,320 individual polypeptides representing 1,200 known and hypothetical proteins, or ~23 % of the entire Pf proteome. We showed that the individual proteins printed on those arrays captured antibodies present in sera from infected individuals and the amount of captured antibody could be quantified using fluorescent secondary antibody. In this way, the complete profileof antibodies that results after natural or experimental exposure or immunization can be determined. We probed the array with serum from people residing in Mali and identified a panel of potential vaccine antigen candidates against which antibodies were significantly elevated in protected children compared to age-matched susceptible children from the same village. In another study, we described a panel of biomarkers and potential vaccine antigens that were preferentially recognized in sera of protected volunteers immunized by the bite of irradiated Pf sporozoites infected mosquitoes as compared to similarly vaccinated but unprotected subjects. These results validate the utility of the Pf proteome microarray developed in the Phase I grant to identify antibodies associated with immune protection. In this Phase II application, we propose to apply an expanded version of the proteome microarray developed in Phase I (containing 4,253 Pf proteins) to determine antibody response in individuals enrolled in several attenuated sporozoite vaccine clinical trials. By comparing the antibody profiles from vaccinees which are protected with those who are not, we aim to identify surrogate antibody biomarkers associated with sporozoite vaccine mediated protection.  There is now a major effort led by our collaborator, Sanaria Inc., to develop purified metabolically active, aseptic, vialed, and cryopreserved Pf sporozoite (PfSPZ) vaccines that prevent infection and transmission and are administered by needle and syringe injection. The first such PfSPZ vaccine has been attenuated by irradiation and is called the PfSPZ Vaccine. Recently, the group at Radboud University Nijmengen Medical Center (RUNMC) published on achieving complete protection against Pf by immunizing volunteers bythe bite of mosquitoes carrying viable (non-irradiated) PfSPZ while taking chloroquine chemoprophylaxis to prevent parasitemia. This protection has now been shown to be sustained for 2 years. Together, Sanaria and RUNMC have shown that they can infect volunteers by needle and syringe administration of viable PfSPZ, and studies to immunize chloroquine treated volunteers with purified viable PfSPZ to determine if they can duplicate the protection seen after administration by mosquito bite are pending. Approximately 1,500 serum specimens from these trials will be used for the biomarker discovery project proposed here. The aim will be to identify and validate these surrogate biomarkers of protection and to develop a validated test intended to be used as a pivotal FDA-required assay to support licensure of the sporozoite vaccine.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: An effective malaria vaccine would greatly benefit millions of infants, children, pregnant women and others at risk of malaria disease and death throughout the malaria-endemic world, but thus far efforts to develop recombinant protein and viral vector vaccines have been disappointing despite intense efforts. This proposal takes advantage of recent discoveries showing that several live attenuated whole organism vaccines can provide robust protection from infection by the parasite. The study proposed here aims to probe a microarray containing 4,253 Pf proteins with hundreds of sporozoite vaccine clinical trial specimens to identify and validate surrogate antibody biomarkers of protection and to develop a validated test intended to be used as a pivotal FDA-required assay to support licensure of the sporozoite vaccine.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There are 350 million people chronically infected with hepatitis B virus who have a high risk for cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer resulting in approximately a million deaths annually. This is an alarming rate asthere has been a safe and efficacious vaccine on the market for more than twenty years. High costs of production, distribution and administration have limited use of this vaccine in developing nations. The inconvenience of clinic visits and fear of injections restrict compliance worldwide. It is an NIH goal to develop new vaccines and delivery technologies that allow more complete vaccination coverage. The long-term objective of this research is to develop an oral vaccine that is safe, effective and stableat ambient temperatures, as well as reducing costs of production, distribution and delivery while boosting compliance. The initial focus of this project is for hepatitis B booster treatments for at-risk individuals and poor responders.  Plant-based production systems have the potential to meet the goals of the ideal oral vaccine. These have shown great promise in animal trials including the ability of a plant-produced hepatitis B antigen to elicit an immune response in a human clinical trial. However, development of this technology has been limited because of the practical limitations imposed by low expression of the antigen and processing constraints.  In Phase I, hepatitis B antigen levels were increased by more than 30-fold and processing methods were established that retained the antigen integrity. This improved material was able to elicit a robust immune response when orally fed to mice. In Phase II, the research is focused on optimizing and characterizing a final product that can be commercialized. This includes 1) optimization and characterization of a high expressing line, 2) a processing method that provides a palatable and stable form of the product, and 3) an immune response in mice so that it elicits a comparable protective response as that of theinjected vaccine. Successful completion of Phase II aims will lead to a clinical trial and to a commercialization path with a human health partner.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The relevance of this project to public health is that it can lead to aninexpensive, stable, and effective oral vaccine for hepatitis B. Such a vaccine can be used for at-risk individuals who respond poorly to the current vaccine and in developing areas where the current vaccine is unavailable due to cost constraints. This research may also pave the way for other vaccines to be administered in a similar fashion.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overall goal of this project is to develop and commercialize a simple cell counter for routine enumeration of CD4 cells for management of HIV-infected individuals. HIV-1 mediated CD4 cell destruction is the centralimmunologic feature of HIV-1 infection. Thus, the CD4 count is a critical measurement in initial disease staging, in monitoring antiretroviral therapy and in managing primary and secondary prophylaxis for opportunistic infections. Flow cytometry is the current standard-of-care for CD4 cell counting. Unfortunately, flow is a central lab-based technique, and sample cold chain and transport, equipment, and operational costs render the technique cost-prohibitive in limited resource settings where HIV prevalence is highest. A simple, point-of-care (POC) CD4 counting tool will fundamentally change HIV-1 management. The first phases of this project have yielded a low-cost prototype instrument that delivers fast, accurate, and reliable CD4 counts for whole blood specimens from both HIV-infected individuals and healthy donors. Building on this success, we propose to complete the technical development by minimizing required user interactions with the device, driving toward an FDA CLIA-waived system. The specific aimsare:       1. Simplify the sample processing protocol and design and build a cartridge/instrument prototype for which the only user interaction is whole blood addition. We will investigate and develop assay reagent combinations (e.g., stain, lysis buffer,etc.), reagent packaging, and modified disposable cartridge and instrument designs to reduce the number of liquid transfer steps in the assay. The development goal is a CLIA-waived (or equivalent) system.       2. Incorporate in-cartridge quality controlsthat confirm correct function and user operation. We will develop a combination of calibration kit components and on-cartridge quality control features, including count calibrators, fluorescent stain indicators and image quality software flags.       3. Demonstrate the accuracy and usability of the CD4 counting system in clinical settings. Field evaluations of the prototype system will be performed at HIV-specific clinics affiliated with the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) Medical Center and in Maputo, Mozambique.       Supporting this effort we have established strong clinical collaborations with global health thought leaders. Co-investigators Dr. Robert Schooley and Dr. Constance Benson at UCSD provide critical input on device requirements, andfacilitate laboratory evaluations. At the conclusion of this project, the utility, value, and unique capabilities of the MBio point of care C4 cell counter will be strongly established, and the final steps in commercialization, i.e., productin instruments,clinical trials, regulatory submission, and marketing will be accelerated.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  HIV/AIDS remains a critical public health concern worldwide. It is estimated that by 2014, 12 million people will need access to affordable, point-of-care CD4 cell count measurements to effectively manage their HIV infection. The proposed research is aimed directly at providing this key medical technology.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The final objective of this Phase II SBIR is to complete preclinical studies of a trivalent adenoviral vaccine against plague in preparation for human clinical trials. The plague vaccine project was selected in responseto the growing concern surrounding the organism&#039;s possible use in a terrorism event. The NIAID and CDC, in response to this threat, has classified the organism as a Category A priority organism. Currently, there are no commercially available vaccines forprotection against plague in the instance of a bioterrorism event. This concern is alarming, as multi-antibiotic-resistant strains of the plague bacterium, Y. pestis, exist in nature or have been engineered. Project Aims for this Phase II SBIR will focus on the production and evaluation of a vaccine candidate featuring the low calcium response (LcrV) antigen in combination with two other protective Y. pestis antigens, namely Caf1 (F1 capsular antigen) and YscF (a type 3 secretion system (T3SS) structural protein), in an adenoviral vector system. The project will test the hypothesis that a single, intranasal administration of the adenoviral vaccine can elicit a strong protective immune response in non-human primates (NHPs) against aerosol challenge with the fully virulent Y. pestis strain CO92. Project aims will also demonstrate the large-scale production capability of the vaccine necessary for meeting stockpiling or emergency scenarios. This program will provide a valuable first line of defense by deterrencefor potential terrorists in search of weapons where no vaccine or treatment option exists. Further, the development of a multivalent adenoviral vaccine is not only significant for biodefense but also for combating global infectious disease.          PUBLICHEALTH RELEVANCE:  The final objective of this Phase II SBIR is to complete preclinical studies of a trivalent adenoviral vaccine against plague in preparation for human clinical trials. Currently there is no licensed vaccine for human use to protect against infection with plague despite the pathogen&#039;s capability to inflict widespread morbidity and mortality upon exposure to both civilians and military personnel.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our goal is to develop small molecule inhibitors that target influenza entry. In Phase I, we identified several compounds that selectively inhibit the hemagglutinin (HA) mediated virus entry process. Three HA specific entry inhibitors (MBX494, MBX994, and MBX726) were selected for further research and development based on their antiviral potency, selectivity and chemical tractability. These influenza inhibitors display high potency (IC50 = 0.3-11  M) and favorable selectivity index values (SIgt20-200) against a wide spectrum of influenza virus strains, including the high pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A/H5N1, 2009 pandemic influenza A/H1N1 and an oseltamivir resistant A/H1N1 strain. The inhibitors also displayed synergy with the neuraminidase inhibitor, oseltamivir. MBX494, MBX994, and MBX726 act in a group-specific manner to inhibit the H1 and H5 subtypes of group 1 HA but not the H3 or H7 subtypes of group 2 HA. Preliminary mechanism of action (MOA) studies suggest that the compounds act early during infection and inhibit the HA-mediated virus-cell membrane fusion process. Failure of the inhibitors to block influenza viruses with group 2 HA, VSV and LASV, further suggests that they do not act on cellular factors (e.g.,endosomal pH, or sialic acid residues or viral/cell membrane). MBX494, MBX994, and MBX726 have aminoalkyl phenol ether, aminoacetamide sulfonamide and simple sulfonamide scaffolds respectively. Preliminary chemical optimization has already generated new active analogs, establishing the suitability of these chemical scaffolds for optimization. In Phase II, we will design, synthesize, and evaluate analogs as HA specific inhibitors. Inhibitor design will be driven by potency, target selectivity, influenza spectrum, synergistic activity with oseltamivir, ad minimal cytotoxicity. The most promising lead inhibitors will be evaluated further for favorable (i in vitro ADME properties, including stability, as well as (ii) in vivo pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) properties, (iii) toxicity, and (iv) efficacy in animal models to select final  pre-clinical candidates. We have five specific aims. In Aim 1, we will design and synthesize analogs of the hit series to establish the SAR and improve potency. We will also use structure based drug design (SBDD) to increase the anti-influenza potency (IC50 lt 0.1  M) and minimize cytotoxicity (CC50 gt100  M). In Aim 2, we will evaluate the analogs for potency and cytotoxicity in vitro to generate 10-20 prioritized leads. In Aim 3, we will further prioritize inhibitors by evaluating in vitro   drug-like   ADME properties. In Aim 4, we will analyze the MOA of anti-influenza activity. In Aim 5, we will validate the prioritized lead inhibitors for efficacy and toxcity in murine models to identify the best preclinical development candidate. Aims 1, 2, 3 and 5 constitute the preclinical candidate optimization process since together they provide the relationships between structure and activity, in vitro ADME and in vivo safetyand efficacy in vivo. Understanding the MOA of the newly synthesized analogs will ensure that analogs maintain the desired mechanism and do not acquire additional or different non-specific mechanisms.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Influenza is a highly infectious acute respiratory disease, characterized by recurrent annual epidemics and periodic major worldwide pandemics. Vaccines, currently the primary strategy for protection against influenza virus infection, are only  effective if they match the circulating virus type(s) and cannot be developed in advance against new emerging pandemic strain(s). Our goal is to develop an anti-influenza therapeutic that can be used to treat the current neuraminidase inhibitor resistant strains and new pandemic strains.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An ideal tool for eliminating Plasmodium falciparum (Pf), the causative agent of 99% of all malaria deaths, would be a highly effective vaccine that prevents blood stage infection and thereby prevents both disease and transmission. Sanaria&#039;s goal is to develop and commercialize a Pf sporozoite (SPZ) vaccine that prevents Pf blood stage infection in gt 90% of recipients. The Sanaria(R) PfSPZ Vaccine is composed of attenuated, purified, aseptic, cryopreserved PfSPZ. The platform technology developed to manufacture the vaccine has also allowed the manufacture of PfSPZ for challenge infections to test vaccines and drugs (PfSPZ Challenge) and for vaccination by challenge under chloroquine protection (PfSPZ-CVac). These comprise a portfolio of products that are on an aggressive timeline to commercialization. The PfSPZ used in these products are extracted from aseptically reared mosquitoes. Increasing the number of SPZ per mosquito directly reduces the cost of goods. This projectwill develop a strain of genetically modified (GM) Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes highly susceptible to PfSPZ infections. By silencing a mosquito immune effector gene, LRIM1 (a member of the LRR gene family), we have reproducibly increased SPZ loads in A.stephensi. We have also demonstrated a phenotype of increased oocyst burdens in a transgenic A. stephensi strain expressing a SRPN6 double- stranded RNA (dsRNA) sequence in a hairpin construct that was fully integrated into the genome. These major resultsjustify this Phase II project which will create GM A. stephensi lines in which expression of LRIM1 or APL1 is reduced or eliminated, providing a stable and efficient SPZ-production platform for Sanaria&#039;s manufacturing process. Two strategies are planned for silencing LRIM1: 1) directly silencing the genes through the expression of gene-specific dsRNA to elicit an endogenous RNA interference response against LRIM1 or APL1 transcripts; 2) indirectly silencing the genes by disrupting the relevant regulatory signaling pathway through either the over-expression of the negative-regulatory protein Caspar or a dominant-negative variant of the transcription factor Rel2. Our successful Phase I strategy was to directly silence genes by driving the expression of gene-specific dsRNA to elicit endogenous RNA interference; this approach will be improved upon for the creation of GM A. stephensi. We will create gene-silencing transgenes by incorporating the GAL4/UAS binary expression system and a &#039;two-target&#039; gene silencingtechnology. This strategy will enable us to limit the costly and time consuming assessments of infection phenotype as it enables efficient determination of gene silencing prior to infectious feeding. This approach will enhance our capacity to produce strains with the optimal genotypes and phenotypes. We will screen GM lines to identify those that consistently produce e 2 fold more PfSPZ compared to the current production strain of A. stephensi. Selected strains will be studied under standard insectary conditions, and under the aseptic conditions used for GMP compliant manufacturing. We will incorporate the optimal GM strain of A. stephensi into Sanaria&#039;s manufacturing process.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: To protect individuals against malaria and to aid in eradicating this disease, a highly effective vaccine is needed. Sanaria has developed a platform technology, manufacture of live Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites (PfSPZ) to make such a vaccine. Two are in clinical development. The first is a live attenuated whole organism vaccine called the PfSPZ Vaccine. The second is a live infectious vaccine administered with an antimalarial drug, a vaccine called PfSPZ-CVac. In addition Sanaria has developed live, infectious PfSPZ, a product called PfSPZ Challenge, for use in testing malaria drugs and vaccines. All the products require the growth of PfSPZ in aseptic Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes. This proposal aims to increase the yields of sporozoites by genetically modifying the mosquito immune system. Success in this project will greatly reduce cost of vaccine manufacture, thereby making the vaccine available more cheaply for travelers and developing world populations.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diseases associated with the Poxviridae (smallpox, vaccinia and cowpox viruses), and Herpesviridae (HSV-1, HSV-2, HSV-8, VZV, EBV) dsDNA viruses represent major worldwide public health problems. NandN Scientific, Inc. (NandN) is developing a first of its class broad-spectrum orally bioavailable antiviral drug, N- methanocarbathymidine (N-MCT), which has exhibited potent activity against herpes and pox viruses and drug-resistant variants in vivo at doses that are non-cytotoxic in mice, rats, guinea pigs and dogs, even at doses 1000-fold higher than the therapeutic dose. These unique pharmacological characteristics suggest that N-MCT will be an ideal candidate for commercial development upon completing pre-IND studies and clinical trials. This Phase II SBIR proposal will help significantly to advance the development of N-MCT towards clinical testing. Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) infection is a chronic disease that affects over 1 billion people worldwide, with distinct diseasesymptoms for each variant. Infections are commonly manifested as oral HSV-1 and HSV-2 infections, genital HSV-2 infection and HSV-8 infection in Kaposi&#039;s sarcoma, which are prevalent in sexually transmitted diseases and immunosuppressed patients. There are500,000 new HSV-2 cases annually in the USA, and account for 75% of neonatal infections. HSV-1 infects between 20-40% of the adult population age 12 and over, and is manifested by recurrent facial cold sores that are treated predominantly with OTC remedies with limited efficacy. In children lt 14 years of age, as many as 35% have serologic evidence of HSV- 1 infection. To address the public health issues associated with HSV and a major commercial market, NandN proposes to develop N-MCT for the treatment and prophylaxis of genital HSV-2 infection, including neonatal infections, for which the current worldwide market is in excess of  2  billion. Current pre-IND studies of N-MCT conducted during the Phase I SBIR grant have demonstrated that N-MCT has several unique characteristics that make it particularly valuable for commercial development. These include: 1) Cytotoxicity only in HSV-infected cells 2) HSV-tk dependant antiviral activity 3) Activity against acyclovir (ACV)-resistant HSV 4) Activity against HSV-1, HSV-2, HSV-8, vaccinia and cowpox viruses 5) Greater potency than ACV across all doses 6) Activity against genital, neonatal and encephalitic HSV-2 infection, and activity against neonatal infection, even when administered 3 days post-infection, in contrast to the lack of activity of ACV 7) No cytotoxicity in mice, rats, guinea pigs and dogs at doses 1000-fold greater than the therapeutic dose 8) High oral bioavailability (80-90%) in mice, rats and dogs 9) Crosses the blood-brain barrier to eliminate HSV-2 encephalitis in mice, in contrast to a lack of efficacy f ACV 10) No toxicity in dogs administered N-MCT orally on a daily 14-day repeat dose schedule with a 14- day recovery period. 11) High drug stability at room temperature over one year with no decomposition SPECIFIC AIMS NandN proposes to develop the first of its class antiviral drug, N-MCT, for the treatment of HSV-2, including ACV- resistant variants. In the Phase I SBIR grant, NandN completed dose-range finding, 7-day acute toxicity testing in rats and dogs, PK studies in rats and dogs, as well as a 14-day repeat-dose toxicity and toxicokinetic study in dogs, including a cardiovascular assessment. NandN also completed efficacy studies in mice and guinea pigs to evaluate N-MCT against genital HSV-2and neonatal and encephalitic infections, respectively. In this Phase II application, NandN proposes to complete an additional efficacy study in a genital HSV-2 guinea pig model resembling the human disease. In addition, we plan to complete the remainingpreclinical toxicity studies, drug formulation and stability studies, plasma  protein binding and metabolism and the synthesis of additional quantities of non- GMP and GMP N-MCT to advance N-MCT to clinical testing as a drug for the treatment of genital, neonatal and encephalitic HSV-2 infections. Specific Aim #1: To obtain additional preclinical efficacy data for N-MCT in a genital HSV-2 guinea pig model. Specific Aim #2: To synthesize sufficient non-GMP and GMP N-MCT for completion of preclinical studies,and formulation and stability studies, respectively. Specific Aim #3: To complete preclinical toxicology and toxicokinetic studies of N-MCT sufficient for filing an IND with the FDA. Formulation studies will define the optimal formulation for a confirmatory PK study in dogs. These studies will allow filing  an IND application for the eventual initiation of Phase I clinical trials to determine the maximum tolerated dose, side effects, bioavailability, pharmacokinetics and the starting doses for Phase IIA clinical trials in patients with genital HSV-2 infections.

These unique pharmacological characteristics suggest that N-MCT will be an ideal candidate for commercial developmentthrough further preclinical studies that lead to an IND application and clinical trials. This Phase II SBIR proposal will help to advance N-MCT towards Phase I clinical testing by completing pre-IND requirements and additional efficacy studies in animals for the eventual treatment of genital and neonatal HSV-2 infections.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of this proposed project is to develop a point-of-care diagnostic assay and platform for the detection of Clostridium difficile from human stool. Two additional goals are to detect the hypervirulent strain of C. difficile B1/NAP/027 and to detect C. difficile spores from swabs of medical devices. C. difficile associated disease (CDAD) is now the most common healthcare acquired infection in the United States with an estimated three million CDAD cases peryear, costing  1- 3.2 billion per year. The frequency of C. difficile acquisition is estimated to be 13% in patients with hospital stays of up to two weeks, and 50% in those with hospital stays longer than four weeks5. Bringing detection of C. difficileto the point-of-care setting will facilitate more timely treatent for patient, as well as reduce the risk of spread of the disease. The capability to monitor surfaces for C. difficile contamination is a unique contribution of this project. Hospitals, nursin homes, and rehabilitation facilities, both nationally and globally, will welcome the ability to monitor the burden of environmental contamination by C. difficile and its spores, respond with infection control procedures accordingly, and verify that thosechanges have achieved the desired result. Claremont BioSolutions (CBio) is developing an integrated disposable assay device and platform that is based on the combination of our proprietary disposable cartridge for sample preparation, PureLyse(R), that canmechanically lyse cells and extract DNA in less than five minutes, with a rapid isothermal nucleic acid amplification system, both embedded into a disposable device. The platform provides detection of the amplification product and is based on CBio&#039;s portable FluoriSense   fluorometer. The PureLyse(R) chamber will be mounted within our novel OmniValve   to create an assay device that lends itself to rapid and efficient manufacturing.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Clostridium difficile has recently become the most common hospital-acquired infection in the United States. We propose to develop a point-of-care assay and portable platform for detecting Clostridium difficile from human stool and from swabs of medical devices based on the combination of (1) ournovel PureLyse(R) rapid and disposable sample preparation system that can lyse cells and extract DNA in less than five minutes, (2) rapid isothermal amplification of DNA, and (3) fluorescence detection with our FluoriSense(R) portable fluorometer.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this Phase II NIH SBIR, Piezo Resonance Innovations will further optimize and test the Portable Transdermal Patch (PTP) - a needle-free platform delivery technology for drugs and vaccines that are currently deliveredsubcutaneously. The portable, 200gm (7oz) electronically-controlled transdermal patch for Enfuvirtide delivery employs a patented transducer technology with integrated battery driven controls to deliver drugs as prescribed. The low power of the PTP transducers will open 25 to 125 5m micro-channels in the stratum corneum, without causing long-term skin damage. Thirty-three million people worldwide are living with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). Currently, patients infected with HIV receive Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) for the management of the infection. Medication regimens for the management of HIV must be taken with near-perfect compliance to maximize benefits and prevent development of viral resistance. Enfuvirtide, approved by theFood and Drug Administration in 2003, is an infusion inhibitor that blocks the HIV from attaching to the CD4 cell. It is subcutaneously injected twice daily and directed at patients not responding to other treatments. The major side effect is an injectionsite reaction, which reduces patient compliance substantially. A needle-free device that enhances patient compliance with Enfuvirtide, and other large-molecule medication regimes, like insulin, will be of great benefit. Phase I developed and tested prototypes and met all of the Specific Aims. Transdermal delivery of Enfuvirtide was demonstrated in pig skin models. Reviews by practicing clinicians were positive and have been used to guide the Phase II Beta prototype design requirements. Phase II will optimize the PTP performance characteristics and electronic control into a small lightweight, ergonomic patch. Safety and efficacy of the PTP will then be evaluated in a live animal model. The PTP Transdermal Delivery Technology will:     Deliver Enfuvirtide (T-20) Transdermally, increasing patient regime compliance     Eliminate the injection site reaction that limits T-20 adoption     Act as a platform technology to deliver other large molecule medications (e.g. insulin)     Be comfortable to wear, painless during operation, and hide discretely under clothing.     Deliver medications through a prescription reservoir that holds dosing for multiple days.     Deliver lower dose, sustained delivery - rather than large bolus dosage.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This Phase II NIH SBIR will finalize development of a Portable, Lightweight Electronically-Controlled Transdermal Patch platform device. The patch will be a needle-free, automatic and safe ultrasonic drug delivery device to keep HIV patients in medication regime compliance - with potential application in a wide range of other medications, such as insulin.",

A previous Phase I project has discovered novel molecules with potent antimalarial activity against both sensitive and multidrug resistant malaria strains in some in vitro and in vivo models. Lead compounds are low in toxicity and possess high oral bioavailability. The potential for development of resistance was confirmed to besmall and a scalable chemical synthesis was also established. The current SBIR Phase II research was designed after pre-IND meeting with FDA. Under Phase II support, the two lead compounds will be synthesized on a large scale. Range-finding toxicity, repeat dose toxicity, and pharmacokinetic studies will be conducted in monkey models. Antimalarial efficacy will be evaluated in Aotus monkeys infected with P. falciparum. One compound with desired toxicity, efficacy, and pharmacokinetic properties will be selected for cGMP manufacturing. This compound will then undergo GLP toxicology studies: definitive 28-day toxicity study with toxicokinetic, functional observations battery and micronucleus evaluations. An investigational new drug (IND) application will be filed with FDA at the end of Phase II research. The novelty of the project is the discovery of new molecular entities. The project involves standard approaches to drug development, but the multidisciplinary team and multi- institution collaboration that hasbeen assembled will accelerate the generation of clinical candidates.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Malaria is one of the most common infectious diseases in the world. It affects approximately 225 million people and leads to about 791,000 death a year.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      There remains a critical need for medicines that can counteract the toxic effects of radiation exposure. Terapio is developing a recombinant protein, RLIP76, for use as a radioprotectant for workers, military personnel, or civilians that are either in imminent danger of radiation exposure,  or have already been exposed. In research carried out at the University of Texas at Arlington, RLIP76 delivered in a liposome was discovered to have significant effects in protecting mice exposed to otherwise lethal doses of radiation, even if the proteoliposome was administered as late as 24 hours after exposure. Terapio was formed to develop and commercialize the protein for use as a radioprotectant. The company was awarded a Phase I SBIR from which exploratory efficacy studies were carried out confirming significant efficacy of the RLIP76 proteoliposome by a variety of routes of administration, including subcutaneous and intramuscular injection, a marked advantage for therapy that has to be delivered in the field. Now the company is applying for a Phase II SBIR to continue that work and carry out the studies necessary to file for an IND. Specifically, the goals of the current application are: 1.) to develop the necessary assays for IND-enabling studies and to verify the proposed tissue-level mechanism of action to the degree required by the FDA; 2.) to perform IND-enabling studies and 3.) to carry out animal safety and toxicokinetic studies in two species (rat and primate) as required by the FDA. Successful completion of these goals will position the company to file an IND in preparation for performing pivotal animal efficacy and human safety studies to support a subsequent New Drug Application.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:The overall goal of this project is to carry out the studies necessary to allow RLIP76 protein to be successfully developed as a medicinal protectant against the toxicity of radiation exposure. Such a treatment will have enormous relevance to public health given the number of people in close proximity to nuclear facilities and the lack of current medical treatments for radiation toxicity.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Respiratory infections have a significant health and economic impact worldwide. Current test products for the diagnosis of respiratory viral infections such as influenza are inadequate for the timely diagnosis needed for successful implementation of antiviral treatment. Unfortunately a test product that can accurately diagnose common respiratory viruses with high confidence in less than 30 minutes directly at point of need has not yet been developed. We propose to develop an innovative device and reagents for the molecular diagnosis of multiple RNA pathogens that will set a new standard for rapid patient care. This application entitled   Point of Care Detection of Respiratory Viruses   seeks to develop a turnkey solutionfor the processing, detection, and digital readout of influenza viruses A and B,  as well as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in 30 minutes. Training requirements for personnel operating the device are minimal. The combination of novel molecular technologies, simple protocol, and affordable multiplex testing capabilities residing in a single, inexpensive device wil enable near point of care diagnostics for a number of serious infectious agents. The research design for achieving this goal includes four processing elements: 1) A one step sample prep that can be completed in a minute, 2) Isothermal amplification of viral RNA in 20 minutes, 3) multiplex sequence specific detection of influenza A, influenza B and RSV including built in standards in a few minutes, and 4) a digital readout of results in electronic form. These steps all  occur within a small 4 x 6 inch instrument containing a disposable reagent cartridge. A key factor enabling this game changing technology is the development of a novel enzyme that converts RNA to DNA and isothermally amplifies it in minutes. These attributes have allowed the design of a device that does not use any microfluidics, pumps or valves. The greatly simplified construction significantly reduces the cost. This new technologyis ideal for to low resource and battlefield settings, and has long term potential as an over the counter device. The test device and reagents developed as part of this application will be validated in a clinical setting with outside experts. During PhaseIII of the project we will apply for FDA clearance of the instrument and reagents and commercialize the diagnostic device in the US and other markets around the globe.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this application is to develop a simple but inexpensive nucleic acid based test device that can diagnose human respiratory viral illness in less than 30 minutes at point of care. Because treatment regimens for respiratory disease differ widely depending on the causative agent, the development, FDA-approval and eventual commercialization of this new clinical diagnostic product would have profound health care benefits for patients and their providers by allowing timely diagnosis to inform both antiviral and  antibiotic therapies.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The human herpesviridae family contains eight members divided into three subfamilies, designated alpha, beta and gamma. The alpha herpes viruses include herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) and varicella zoster virus (VZV). The beta herpes viruses include human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), two variants of human herpes virus 6 (HHV-6A, HHV-6B), and human herpes virus 7 (HHV-7). The gamma herpes viruses include Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and human herpes virus 8 (HHV-8). Herpes virus infections are commonly acquired, and many present major health concerns, especially among immunocompromised patient populations (e.g., transplant recipients, AIDS patients, and the elderly). Because of the narrow spectrum of current therapeutics, emergence of resistant virus strains, and the limiting toxicities of current treatment options, there is a definite need for new agents that are effective and safe for treating herpes virus infections, particularly those caused by drug-resistant virus strains in the immunocompromised patient. We have previously identified the methylenecyclopropane nucleosides (MCPNs) as potent inhibitors of HCMV, HHV- 6 and HHV-8. The original goal of the SBIR Phase I proposal was to identify new MCPN analogs with even greater anti-HHV6/8 potency and efficacy, while maintaining HCMV activity. We have exceeded that SBIR Phase I goal, and have now identified novel MCPN analogs with a very unusual, broad anti-herpes spectrum of activity that includes the alpha-, beta- and gamma-herpes viruses, including ACV resistant strains. To our knowledge, this broad spectrum activity has not been seen with existing anti-herpes virus agents. The primary objective of this SBIR Phase II proposal is to evaluatea limited number of the most potent MCPNs in murine toxicity, PK/PD, and efficacy (HSV/CMV/VZV) in animal models to identify a final broad- spectrum anti-herpes virus preclinical candidate, and backup compound, to advance into IND enabling rat GLP toxicology and safety pharmacology studies.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Improved diagnosis of Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct) infections represents a critical unmet medical need. Ct is the most common cause of bacterial sexually transmitted diseases (STD) worldwide, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that there are 2.8 million US cases annually. Currently, 40% of women with untreated infection will develop pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), 20% of whom will become infertile, 18% will experience debilitating, chronic pelvic pain, and 9% will have a life-threatenig ectopic pregnancy. If an infected pregnant woman is not treated, her baby has a 50% chance of developing conjunctivitis and a 20% chance of pneumonia in the first six months of life. Ct is also a risk factor for invasive squamous-cell carcinoma of the cervix and a complicating factor in HIV-1 infection and transmission. In males, the clinical presentation includes proctitis, genital ulcer and/or inguinal lymphadenopathy. The main obstacle to stemming this epidemicis the lack of an inexpensive nucleic acid-based point-of-care (POC) diagnostic for screening.  Current chlamydial diagnostics are primarily based on nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) that lack concordance across the different NAATs, vary in sensitivity (although specificity is high), are expensive, require technical expertise, take days for results, and cannot be performed at the POC. They are also unable to differentiate between invasive lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) versus non-invasive strains, the former of which require weeks of antibiotic therapy for eradication. Our overall SBIR goal is to develop a rapid, cost-effective, sensitive and specific Ct  POC diagnostic system to increase early detection, inform appropriate treatment, reduce the rateof infections, and thereby reduce sequelae. In SBIR Phase I, we developed an initial microfluidic NAAT and demonstrated that its sensitivity and specificity are superior to those of a commercial NAAT. In SBIR Phase II, we propose to: 1) Optimize our assaybased on information gained by whole genome sequencing clinical Ct strains; 2) incorporate all assay processes in an easy-to operate breadboard instrument; and 3) do a head-to-head comparison of the optimized system against two commercially available assays. Given the genomic expertise of Dr. Tim Read and the chlamydial STD expertise of Dr. Dean, and the molecular biological and microfluidic expertise of Dr. Selden, the application provides a unique collaborative opportunity to finally obtain a rapid nucleic-acid based POC diagnostic for C. trachomatis.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Chlamydia trachomatis is the leading bacterial cause of sexually transmitted diseases in the US. Many of these infections are asymptomatic and go undetected, which leads toincreased transmission and the sequelae of pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility and ectopic pregnancy.

NetBio is developing an easy to use, cost effective diagnostic that detects C. trachomatis within one hour at the point-of-care.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The hepatitis C virus (HCV) infects approximately 4 million people in the U.S, and 170 million people worldwide. The high mutation rate of HCV results in vast numbers of new genetic sequences and associated biological data in the daily conduct of laboratory research and clinical trials with attendant serious data management problems. Investigators currently rely upon in-house developed databases, generic software products, and tools from public web repositories to sort,organize and analyze their genomic and biological data. These tools are not tailored to the HCV genome, and moving data from one program to the next is labor intensive and vulnerable to error. We are developing a web-based (vs. local server only) softwareproduct tailored for the rapid, efficient and flexible management of HCV data.  The product consists of graphical-user interface (GUI) tools and a data-storage and retrieval system that are both designed specifically for HCV analysis. It also includes a commercial relational data base engine. The most notable technical innovation is our annotation tool which simplifies the capture, storage and management of crucial experimental data points, and brings these user defined data points (annotations) into the same searchable context as those that are inherently systemic and structured. Other innovations include our alignment, phylogenetics and mutation analysis tools that are specifically tailored to the mathematics of the HCV replication rate and its error-pronepolymerase. In preliminary and Phase I work we designed, built and successfully unit tested a prototype software system, consisting of 3 tiers; presentation (GUI), middleware (Domain), and a relational database management system (RDBMS), and including tools for conducting HCV- tailored alignments and contig assemblies that are linked to a highly flexible query tool, as well as tools for assembling and viewing phylogenic trees and for producing graphics tool that present the raw electropherogram data (traces), and assemble line and bar graphs to plot up to two variables.  In this Phase II work, we will develop additional tools for mutation tracking, report generation and entropy measurement, and we will develop statistical routines and security and installation packages. Specific Aims: Aim I. Transition the software platform to cloud computing and hosting environment; Aim II. Develop a suite of tools for conducting full mutation analysis; Aim III. Develop statistical routines; Aim IV. Unit test the software application. We are seeking funds to build our product, addressing a scientific need with a marketable bioinformatics approach. In this way, we will merge informatics with basic research for rapid discovery. We believe that our disease-specific software products will aid in the rapidly developing market of HCV research. The result will be software that greatly improves analysis capabilities and reduces data processing time. These goals fall well within the scope of the NIH to promote basic research in the field of bioinformatics and information sciences, and could lead to enormous public benefit.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The hepatitis C virus (HCV) is difficult to study and not effectively treated with the current anti- viral drug combination. Effective treatment options are years away. A major problem that HCV investigators must contend with is the rapid mutation rate of the viral genes, which creates a need to test patients continuously and a massive data accumulation problem. We are developing a powerful, game-changing software application that will make it easier for scientists to overcome these problems and focus on treatment and cure discovery.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): 100,000 Americans perish each year due to untreatable bacterial infections. The societal benefits of new antibiotic compounds that are effective against numerous multiple drug resistant pathogens would be significant. The best possible source for new antibiotic structures with potentially novel mechanisms of action is within natural environments, particularly soils, which have the greatest diversity of microbial life. This research proposal advances the science of metagenomics, the cloning of DNA from entire microbial communities, to discover novel antibiotics and identify the best lead candidates for clinical development. During Phase I research scientists at Lucigen Corporation and Auburn University united four key technological breakthroughs that together resulted in the next generation metagenomic library. This library combined 1) an improved methodology for the isolation and purification of high molecular weight genomic DNA from soil microorganisms; 2) a new broad host range shuttle vector for enhanced expression of cloned DNAs; 3) a random shear cloning method to produce very large insert sizes (gt100 kb); and 4) a rapid and improved screening method to identify antibiotic-producing clones within a metagenomic library. The library produced in Phase I was screened against a clinical isolate of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), resulting in the identification of 28 metagenomic clones that produce anti- MRSA compounds. 12 of these anti-MRSA clones were analyzed by sequencing and found to have very large insert sizes (average 113.5 kb) and novel genetic diversity not encountered before. Moreover, one of the clones was found to produce a novel chemical metabolite. These results are 10-100 fold more efficient than previous efforts. In Phase II a large metagenomic library will be constructed and extensively screened for antimicrobial activity against four multiple drug resistant pathogens. We expect to uncover hundreds of novel chemical entities using this approach, and lead candidates with high potency against multiple bacterial pathogens will be evaluated for efficacy using a novel in vivo assay of MRSA. These technologies represent an important advancement for the science of antibiotic discovery. Furthermore, the libraries produced from this research are a valuable genomic resource that may be screened for other bioactive compounds (e.g., anticancer, antifungal or antiviral activities).        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In the fight against microbial infectiousdisease we are losing ground due to the development of antibiotic resistance and our inability to find replacement drugs. The loss of life and the burden of treatment is a significant public health threat to American citizens. The proposed research unleashes a new set of tools for drug discovery that is 10-100 times more efficient than conventional technologies.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With recent radiation release from reactors in Japan and increasing probability of nuclear detonation somewhere in the world, there is a critical need for development of effective medicinal counter-measures that can bedelivered after exposure to prevent radiation-induced mortality. Adding to this need, mortality increases significantly when radiation is combined with injury (RCI). Agents to mitigate effects of radiation and RCI must therefore be developed and stockpiledfor emergency use. We proposed that TP508 (rousalatide acetate), a novel peptide drug currently in clinical trials for healing diabetic foot ulcers and fractures, may prevent RCI-induced mortality based on its acceleration of wound healing and its uniquebeneficial effects on vascular endothelial cells. Phase 1 studies demonstrated that TP508 applied topically to wounds or delivered by post-exposure injection, restored normal wound healing in irradiated animals, prevented radiation-induced up-regulation ofIL-6, and mitigated RCI-induced mortality. Post-exposure TP508 injection also delayed mortality and the onset of bacteremia following a lethal dose of radiation. Phase 2 will focus on optimization of TP508 formulations for topical and systemic delivery and refinement of these formulations to increase their stability and potential for use following a nuclear disaster. Specifc Aims include comparisons and optimization of formulations, testing stabilized peptides, and selecting best modes of delivery by measuring mitigation of mortality, protection of endothelial function and restoration of wound healing. Following a meeting with the FDA, additional GLP safety, efficacy and final formulation stability studies will be outsourced to meet specific FDA requirements for TP508 approval under the   Animal Rule   exemption. Upon completion of Phase 2, TP508 product(s) should be ready for pivotal Animal Rule efficacy trials and accelerated approval for emergency stockpiling to mitigate effects of nuclear radiation and RCI.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Following a nuclear detonation the combination of radiation and traumatic injury is expected to be much more deadly that radiation alone. We have demonstrated that TP508, a novel peptide drug in human clinical trials,mitigates effects of whole body radiation and radiation combined with injury on mortality, wound healing, and dysfunction of multiple organ systems. In Phase 2, we will optimize TP508 formulations for topical and systemic delivery and complete FDA requirements to allow TP508 to begin pivotal trials to reduce mortality from nuclear radiation exposure.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Pathogens responsible for many of the common human infectious diseases such as urinary tract infection (UTI), gastroenteritis, pneumonia, and wound infections have proven to be highly adept in acquiring mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance. Widespread injudicious practice of empiric antibiotic usage by healthcare providers and infiltration of antibiotics in the food chain have accelerated selection and dissemination of resistant pathogens. As a consequence, clinicianshave fewer treatment options, particularly in the most needy patients. An example of the problem was the rapid emergence of trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole (SXT) resistant E. coli, which accounts for 85-90% of the UTIs in the community setting. Prior to the 1990s, beta-lactams such as ampicillin (AMP) were the standard antimicrobial regimen for acute uncomplicated UTIs, but was replaced with SXT when E. coli resistance against beta-lactams surpassed 25%. With increasing use, however, SXT resistance increased substantially and quinolones such as ciprofloxacin (CIP) became the antibiotic of choice. Not surprisingly, quinolone-resistant uropathogens are on the rise. In hospitals where MDR pathogens are of even greater problem, the quinolone-resistance rate foruropathogenic E. coli has now exceeded 50% in some settings. The goal of this Phase II NIAID Advanced Technology SBIR application is to develop and validate RAST (rapid antimicrobial susceptibility testing), an integrated diagnostic compact system to enable clinicians to direct point-of-care (POC), evidence-based selection of antibiotics for treatment of acute bacterial infections. RAST addresses the major limitations of standard phenotypic AST platforms (e.g., bioMerieux Vitek, BD Phoenix) by providing rapid (90 minutes vs. 2 days) and decentralized (POC vs. laboratory-based) testing. RAST complements our ongoing NIAID Cooperative Agreement, An Integrated Diagnostic Biochip for Point of Care Pathogen Identification (U01 AI082457), for rapid molecular diagnosis urinary tract infections (UTI) using electrochemical biosensors integrated with microfluidics. Since Phase I, we have accomplished several critical milestones: (1) development and clinical validation of a 3.5 hour bench-top RAST protocol showing 94% accuracy; (2) compatibility of RAST with clinical urine samples without need for initial bacterial isolation; (3)  feasibility of on-chip electrokinetic bacterial concentration and assay enhancement; (4) on-chip bacterial culture using microchannels; (5) integrated microfluidic cartridge for pathogen identification; and (6) preliminary feasibility of cartridge-based RAST. In the current Phase II project, we propose three Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. Optimization and validation of electrokinetic (EK) processing modules for volume reduction and in situ assay enhancement. The goal of Aim 1 is to develop an EK volume reduction module for enriching the sample 100-fold within 10 min and to develop an in situ EK enhancement technique for improving the detection sensitivity of the electrochemical assay by 10-fold. Specific Aim 2. Development of the RAST cartridge for rapid phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing. The goal of Aim 2 is to develop the process flow and fabrication process for the RAST cartridge and reader/manifold system, including sample loading, EK volume reduction, on-chip sample culturing in selective media containing different antibiotics of interest, and phenotypic AST by quantitative measurement of bacterial 16S rRNA. Specific Aim 3. Clinical translation of RAST cartridge in urine. The goal of Aim 3 is to perform analytical validation of RAST cartridge and reader/manifold system and a clinical feasibility study using 30 unknown clinical samples from patients suspected to have UTI.  The development and validation of RAST will adhere to the recommended standards of Quality Management Standard for Medical Devices (ISO 13485) and federal regulations for fully automated short-term incubation cycle antimicrobial susceptibility system (21 CFR 866.1645)(see Commercialization Plan D.1.3). Successful accomplishment of our milestones in this Phase II application will be followed by FDA 510(k) submission to demonstrate the system is substantially equivalent to a predicate device. A separate Milestones andTimeline section is included at the end of the Research Strategy.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Development of a compact platform capable of rapid pathogen ID and AST directly from patient&#039;s samples can provide clinicians at the point of care (e.g., outpatient office, emergency department) with evidenced-based information to start patient-specific antimicrobial treatment only when necessary. Rapid susceptibility test results and alterations in the use of antibiotics, even short-term, have been found tofavorably impact patient care and the antibiotic resistance profiles.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and methicillin sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) are highly significant human health threats that are responsible for a range of diseases. Recently, the CDC and colleagues reported that MRSA are the most significant causes of serious infections and infectious disease deaths in the United States. A major factor involved in the lethality of MRSA and MSSA are secreted toxins, known as super antigens. The lethality associated withthese super antigens has been appreciated for decades, as the U.S. military stockpiled large amounts of staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) under its old bioweapons program that was terminated in 1969. The mechanism of action of the toxins is well known -they act extracellularly by binding to the T cell receptor on T cells and stimulating massive release of inflammatory cytokines. We have engineered soluble T cell receptors for high-affinity binding to super antigens to prevent toxin-associated lethality.The objective of this proposal is to build on the success of work completed in Phase I where treatment with the novel therapeutic (soluble, high-affinity T cell receptor, called IMV-01) was able to neutralize SEB secreted from MRSA in an intrapulmonary rabbit model. The hypotheses of the Phase II work are that yields of the therapeutics can be improved, that IMV-01 and two soluble T cell receptor leads (IMV-02 and IMV-03) already engineered against the other clinically important super antigens (SEC and TSST-1) can be co-administered as a cocktail to neutralize these toxins, and prevent lethality due to pneumonia caused by MRSA. The Specific Aims are: 1) To determine the best conditions for optimizing the yield and purity of the V?-TCRs IMV-01, IMV-02 and IMV-03; 2) To determine the effective dose and timing of IMV-01, IMV-02 or IMV-03 individually to neutralize their respective toxins produced by MRSA strains in an intrapulmonary rabbit model in the presence or absence of vancomycin; and 3) To determine the efficacy of using IMV-01, IMV-02 and IMV- 03 as a cocktail to protect rabbits from death due to intrapulmonary challenge with three different MRSA strains secreting either SEB + SEC, SEB + TSST-1 or SEC + TSST-1, in the presence or absence of vancomycin.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Antibiotic-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates frequently initiate serious human diseases through the bacterium&#039;s colonization of respiratory mucosa and skin, followed by secretion of potent toxins referred to as superantigens. Illnesses include serious post viral pneumonias, allergic skin diseases, and delayed wound healing that affect thousands of individuals each year in the United States. The secreted toxins are directly involved in the effects of the, disease and can cause death. In this application, ImmuVen will develop a therapeutic that neutralizes these toxins, and examine its effectiveness in various models of lethal pneumonia caused by the bacterium.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this proposal is to assess the feasibility of using recombinant virus-like- particles (VLPs) to elicit neutralizing antibodies and  prime CD4+ T cells reactive with hepatitis B viral (HBV) antigens as candidate immunotherapeutics for chronic HBV infection. For this purpose, we have defined 8 neutralizing B cell epitopes from the HBV envelope Pre-S1 region, which will be consolidated and inserted onto a species variant of the HBV core protein, namely thewoodchuck hepatitis core antigen(WHcAg). Pre-S1 B cell epitopes were chosen because of their preferential expression on HBV virions. The WHO estimates that more than 360 million individuals are chronically infected with HBV and approximately 20- 40% will develop serious complication such as cirrhosis, liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma. Although a safe and efficacious preventative vaccine for HBV has been available for over 20years, HBV infections continue (with more than 50 million HBV infections per year) to be a major health problem and no effective treatments for chronic infection exist. Antiviral drugs have improved the therapeutic options for chronic HBV, but, their efficacy remains limited due to reactivation of HBV replication  upon drug withdrawal. Vaccine-based immunotherapy has been suggested as a possible monotherapy or as a combination therapy with antiviral drugs. However, immune tolerance has prevented therapeutic vaccine efficacy. To circumvent the obstacle of immune tolerance in HBV chronic carriers, we have chosen the WHcAg, which is approximately 66-68% homologous with the HBcAg, as a vaccine carrier. The WHcAg and the HBcAg are not crossreactive at the B cell level and, just as importantly for our purposes, are only partially crossreactive at the CD4+ T cel level. Therefore, CD4+ T cells specific for WHcAg-unique T cell sites will provide cognate T-B cell help for anti- PreS1 antibody production and will not be curtailed by immune tolerance. In fact, in preliminary studies in HBcAg-Tg mice, which are tolerant to HBcAg, immunization with hybrid WHcAg- PreS1 VLPs elicits equivalent high titer anti- PreS1 antibodies in wildtype and HBcAg-Tg mice. Specifically, in Aim 1 we propose to consolidate 8 HBsAg-PreS1 neutralizing B cell epitopesonto the WHcAg VLP carrier and optimize the constructs based on assembly, yield, stability and immunogenicity and the therapeutic efficacy of the VLP-based vaccine candidates will be evaluated in a transgenic (Tg) mouse model of HBV replication. In Aim 2 preclinical development of the WHcAg-PreS1 vaccine will be pursued including cGMP manufacturing and pharm/tox studies.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It is estimated by the WHO that worldwide more than 400 million people are chronically infected with thehepatitis B virus (HBV) and approximately 20-40% will develop serious complications such as cirrhosis, liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma. Although a safe and effective preventative vaccine for HBV is available, the existing treatments for chronicinfection are unsatisfactory for a number of reasons. This is a proposal to develop virus-like- particles (VLPs) capable of eliciting neutralizing anti-HBV antibodies and priming CD4+/CD8+ T cells reactive with HBV antigens as a candidate therapeutic vaccine for chronic HBV infection.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This SBIR Phase II grant will support the commercial development of an injectable biological product candidate, a unique proprietary recombinant humanized anti-factor XI monoclonal antibody (AXIMAB), towards an investigational new drug (IND) application. The lead indication for AXIMAB is severe bacterial sepsis, which is a major cause of mortality in hospitalized patients. Sepsis-associated disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) contributes to organ perfusion deficits, ischemia, and a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Antithrombotic drugs may effectively limit septic DIC; however, their antithrombotic doses can produce severe bleeding side-effects. Apart from antibiotics, the only FDA-approved treatment for severe sepsis is the anticoagulant enzyme recombinant activated protein C (APC, Xigris(R)), but the bleeding side-effects of APC can often outweigh its benefits. There is a major unmet medical need for safer and more effective treatments, and our product candidate addresses this need by providing an alternative to APC. In primates, anticoagulation with our anti-FXI antibodies 1A6 or 14E11 is safe and antithrombotic. Our SBIR Phase I data demonstrate that anticoagulation with our universal anti-FXI antibody 14E11 improves the survival of polymicrobial peritonitis in mice, while reducing the inflammatory and coagulation responses to sepsis, and our Phase II preliminary studies show a survival benefit for mice treated with 14E11 during septic Listeriosis.We have demonstrated that 14E11 selectively inhibits factor XI (FXI) activation by factor XIIa (FXIIa). Since FXI activation by FXIIa is independent of hemostasis, using 14E11 for blocking prothrombotic FXI activation by FXIIa could translate into therapeutic anticoagulation with unprecedented safety. Since no comparable product exists, AXIMAB 14E11 would compete successfully with APC and other anticoagulants under development, including activated FXI inhibitors, and therefore has a very large market potential. The Specific Aims are to 1. Evaluate the efficacy of AXIMAB 14E11 treatment in experimental microbe-specific sepsis; 2. Determine the activity and stability of GMP-grade humanized recombinant AXIMAB batches; and 3. Determine the toxicity of humanizedAXIMAB in preclinical studies. Success of this Phase II project will support the advancement of AXIMAB into clinical studies.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Occlusion of blood vessels by clots significantly contributes to the high mortality rate of sepsis, and drugs that are effective against blood clots in vessels (antithrombotic drugs or   blood thinners  ) have only limited utility because they also aggravate the bleeding tendency (coagulopathy) that characterizes severe sepsis. Apart from antibiotics, the only FDA-approved treatment for severe sepsis is the antithrombotic enzyme recombinant activated protein C (APC, Xigris(R)), but bleeding side-effects often outweigh its benefits. The lack of safe and effective sepsis treatments represents a major unmet medical need that we address with the development of a new antithrombotic molecule, a therapeutic anti-factor XI antibody that does not cause bleeding and thus provides a safe alternative to APC for treating the coagulopathic complications of sepsis.1",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overall goal of this phase 2 SBIR proposal is to develop and commercialize a novel biologic for allergen- specific immunotherapy as effective treatment for cat allergy/asthma. Cat allergy is common, with 17% of USpopulation, age 6-59, being skin test positive for cat and 60% of those individuals have symptoms when exposed to cat dander Cat allergen, Fel d1, is particularly ubiquitous because of the small size of the airborne cat dander particles and is one of the key aeroallergens implicated in the current epidemic of allergic asthma. Presently, immunotherapy to treat cat allergy is problematic because it requires repeated visits to the allergists&#039; office over a 3-5 year period and commonly elicits allergic reactions. The molecule that comprises our novel approach is a genetically engineered cat allergen-human Fc?1 fusion protein that is designed for a far greater safety profile so that it can be given as injectable immunotherapy (i) with greater safety, (ii) in a far more rapid time frame and (iii) without the pro-allergic effects of current allergen immunotherapy. In phase 1 of this SBIR, we created and expressed an optimal cat-human chimeric fusion protein and derived a current good manufacturing process (cGMP)-quality CHO cell line that is ready to produce material for good laboratory practice (GLP) toxicology. This phase 2 proposal comprises the studies that are expected to provide a strong Investigational New Drug (IND) application for full-scale Phase I/Phase IIa clinical trials upon completion. To achieve this, we will meet six key Aims. Aim 1: develop biochemical and cell-based assays for characterization of the material to be used for formulation development, GLP toxicology studies and in support of cGMP manufacture; these assays will be run under GLP SOPs with independent Quality Assurance monitoring. Aim 2: perform pre-formulation and stability experiments in preparation for transfer of the to a cGMP manufacturer. Aim 3: complete cell line development, mastercell bank production, cGMP manufacture and purification, formulation and final sterile fill on the fusion protein drug product. Aim 4: develop an improved purification process, produce and formulate the material necessary for the proposed GLP toxicology studies. Aim 5: perform GLP toxicology in 2 species (rat and non-human primate) as required for IND filing. Aim 6: prepare and file an IND application with the FDA and work with that agency toward approval of this application. Successful completion of phase2 would set the stage for the initiation of clinical trials to test the safety and efficacy of FDG in US-based trials. We envision the successful development of this fusion protein platform for cat allergy as not only an important new therapeutic for catallergy/asthma but also as the sign post for development of this approach for the treatment of severe IgE mediated food allergy.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Effective treatments to for severe inhalant allergy represent a major unmet medical need with catallergy being one of the key allergens involved. Symptomatic cat allergy affects 30 million people in the United States and is primary trigger for 30% (3 million) asthma cases as well. Cat allergen, because of the physical characteristics of the particlesit is on is essentially ubiquitous in schools, public buildings and homes. Immunotherapy (allergy shots) works but it has a relatively low therapeutic index and poor compliance due to the need for multiple injections over a prolonged period of time with associated local and even systemic reactions. The goal of this proposal is to develop and commercialize a novel cat allergy vaccine that will be safer, faster and more effective than the current treatments.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching goal of this project is to move a new, dry powder formulation of Hepatitis-B vaccine on its path to commercialization. In the Phase I SBIR we tested in vitro three Hep-B dry powder formulations of commercially available Shanvac-B and demonstrated powder stability and immunogenicity at temperatures ranging from -20 ?C through 65 oC. At these temperature extremes the currently marketed liquid Hepatis B vaccine is inactivated as the HBsAg antigen separates from the alum adjuvant. Our studies also showed that the dry micro-scale powders dissolved very rapidly, suggesting their utility in single dose auto-reconstitution devices aimed at parenteral administration. These results have far-reaching implications inregard to vaccine storage, transport and administration, especially in  developing countries where limited refrigeration and electric power and high ambient temperatures restrict the useful life and potency of liquid vaccines. In the proposed Phase II SBIRstudy, we will choose the   optimum   formulation from the three that we developed earlier and pair this powder with a single dose auto-reconstitution device being developed by Becton Dickinson (BD). The drug- device combination will be used to assess potency in a mouse model compared to a control group of animals that will be administered Shanvac-B by needle and syringe. Potency will be assessed from ELISA analysis of animal sera. . The outcome of the Phase II work will be judged based on the potency of the Hep-B dry powder formulation and the functionality and performance of the BD device as compared with the potency of the needle and syringe administration.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The alarming increase in incidence of infections caused by drug-resistant bacteria has created an urgent need for new antibacterial agents. We are developing a novel class of small molecule antibiotics (  TZUs  ) targeting PolC, the replicative DNA polymerase in Gram-positive bacteria. These agents exhibit broad-spectrum activity against Gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP), Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A strep), vancomycin resistant enterococcus (VRE), Bacillus anthracis, Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium difficile. TZUs demonstrate bactericidal activity, oral bioavailability, in vivo efficacy, a low propensity fortoxicity and a low rate of spontaneous resistance. TZUs inhibit a novel bacterial target, thereby circumventing existing mechanisms of antibiotic resistance. We have made compelling progress during Phase I, having already met several key goals. In particular, we have identified several TZUs with in vitro potency exceeding that of linezolid, the only orally active drug approved for MRSA. We seek Phase II funding to enable completion of pivotal studies required for filing of an Investigational New Drug (IND)application. The research plan is divided into three stages. Aim 1 focuses on in-depth characterization of three top TZUs; each exhibits key attributes including in vivo efficacy following oral administration and outstanding microbiological potency. Aim 1studies will include in vivo pharmacodynamics (PD) dose response studies, determination of pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters in two species, determination of the PK-PD index, evaluation of in vitro and in vivo toxicity, and determination of rates of resistance development. Based on these results, the TZU that best exemplifies the target product profile will be selected as the IND candidate. In Aim 2, process chemistry work will commence, focusing on improving synthetic yields, lowering cost, and making the synthetic process more scalable (e.g., by elimination of chromatographic steps). At this stage, the goal will be to develop a synthetic route appropriate for 1-10 kilogram scale synthesis at a cost of less than  25,000 per kg. Exploratory toxicology and toxicokinetic studies will be performed under non-GLP conditions in two species to support dose selection, toxicology endpoints and toxicokinetic time points for GLP-compliant studies. Analytical and bioanalytical methods will be validated under Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) conditions. Comprehensive microbiological characterization will be performed, including MIC90 testing in several Gram-positive species, evaluation of cross-resistance, post antibiotic effect (PAE) and synergy with other antibiotics. In Aim 3, a 5-10 kg GLP-toxicology batch will be synthesized, and GLP-compliant toxicology and safety pharmacology studies will be performed. Successful completion of these IND-enabling studies would support advancement of this program into human clinical trials. This project represents a compelling opportunity to combat the rising tide of antibiotic-resistant infections, providing a much-needed public health benefit.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The alarming increase in incidence of infections caused by drug-resistant bacteria has created an urgent need for new antibacterial agents. The drug we wish to develop represents a brand new antibiotic class with broad-spectrum Gram-positive antibacterial activity. Existing bacterial populations are highly susceptible to this drug, highlighting the truly life-saving potential of this new agent.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Malaria is a global disease causing gt 500 million clinical cases and gt 1 million deaths each year. Moreover, drug resistant Plasmodium falciparum has become a major problem. Therefore, it is crucial to discover new classes of drugs for anti-malarial drug design to combat resistant parasites. We propose that antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) may provide the basis of a novel class of antimalarials. AMPs are an essential component of the innate immune system. AMPs display very broad- spectrum action against bacteria, yeast, fungus by specifically disrupting their membranes rather than targeting proteins. Antiparasitic activities are also reported for a number of AMPs and are thought to kill protozoa by a mechanism similar totheir mechanism of action against bacteria: interacting with plasma membranes, causing excessive permeability, lysis and death. Specificity for the parasite versus host cell is attributed to differences in phospholipid content and the lack of cholesterol in the protozoan membranes. Importantly, the site of action for AMPs is the plasma membrane and not any specific receptors or intracellular protein targets that can easily mutate to escape drug inhibition. Thus, the development of resistance to AMPs is lesslikely to occur. However, while AMPs have good antimicrobial activity, problems with tissue distribution and toxicity have presented obstacles to translating this expensive class of peptides into drugs. PolyMedix has developed series of small non-peptidicmimics of these AMPs (SMAMPs), which have robust, broad- spectrum activity against bacteria and markedly lower toxicity in animals. We propose SMAMPs may provide the basis of a novel class of antimalarials against which resistance will be intrinsically difficult to develop. SMAMPs from PolyMedix were tested and several kill Pl. falciparum parasites in culture having submicromolar IC50s and low cytotoxicity. Importantly, the top hits are active against both chloroquine-sensitive and resistant parasite lines. Our hypothesis is that they act through the perturbation of the food vacuole and possibly other parasitic membranes resulting in the rapid lysis of the food vacuole and parasite death. Membrane targets in bacteria for antimicrobials have been associatedwith a lower likelihood for developing resistance and this will be tested in Pl. falciparum. The goal of this grant is to validate and pursue antimalarial SMAMPs for therapeutic development. The Phase I portion generates proof-of-concept for this class ofcompounds through in vitro and in vivo efficacy testing. The Phase II segment aims to result in a discovery lead therapeutic candidate(s). Targeting parasite membranes using SMAMPs represents a highly innovative and novel approach to treating parasitic diseases and distinguishes this project from others in the field.       Malaria is a global disease causing at least 500 million clinical cases and more than 1 million deaths each year. Moreover, drug resistant Plasmodium falciparum has become a major problem. Therefore, it is paramount to discover new classes of drugs for anti- malarial drug design to combat resistant parasites. We propose to develop novel antimalarial therapeutics using small non-peptidic mimics of naturally-occurring antimicrobial peptides.These therapeutics should prove to be potent, active against resistant parasites and display a low incidence of resistance.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Development of a vaccine to prevent, or reduce the rate of, HIV infections remains a high priority despite recent setbacks in the field. The lessons from failed and successful experimental programs indicate the need toapply new approaches to HIV vaccine design with the goal of inducing immune responses that are the appropriate type, quality, magnitude and active in the appropriate sites in the body. A promising approach is the use of the Adenovirus serotype 4 (Ad4) as avaccine delivery vehicle. The Ad4 virus is a component in the US Military adenovirus vaccine which was formulated for administration in an oral dosage form. Oral delivery should be advantageous for HIV vaccines because this route of administration is morelikely to induce mucosal immune responses than parenteral injection and would target the gut mucosal tissues in particular. The Ad4 vaccine vector is replication-competent in humans which should drive the induction and expansion of immune responses that are different, in terms of magnitude and effector functions, than those induced by non- replicating vectors. In Y1, multiple Ad4 vectors will be engineered to express unique antigens including: 1) HIV-1 Env clade C protein for the purpose of inducing antibody responses broadly effective against a variety of HIV strains; 2) GBV-C E2 glycoprotein, which may induce antibodies that block HIV-1 cellular attachment; and 3) Gag protein, which may induce T cell responses which promote killing of HIV-1 virus infectedcells. Since human adenoviruses such as Ad4 do not replicate in non-human animals, including NHPs, we will also construct analogous replicating Simian adenovirus (SAd7) vectors to allow a direct comparison of the efficacy of Ad4 (non-replicating vector inNHPs) with an analogous replicating vector, SAd7. All vectors will be assessed for immunogenicity in small animals (mice /rabbits) before proceeding to NHP studies in Y2. Once immunogenicity is confirmed in NHPs, we will evaluate their efficacy in an NHPR5 SHIV clade C challenge study. Both antibody (neutralizing and ADCVI) and T cell immune responses (IFN- ) will be determined. Completion of this SBIR program will provide sufficient data to determine the utility of this Ad4 vector system for inducing effective antibody and T cell responses and potentially could yield an experimental vaccine suitable for clinical development.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The development of a safe and protective vaccine against the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) that causes AIDS has been very difficult. The proposed research will modify an existing adenovirus vaccine, which was used safely in more than 10 million people, so that it expresses HIV proteins and induces an immunological response in animals. This vaccinewill have advantages of being a live virus vaccine, such as the polio or measles vaccines, which can be taken by mouth without risk of causing HIV infection.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Abstract The long-term objective of this research is to develop a non-invasive approach for assessment of de novo 3MH production in cancer patients early in the course of the disease as a way of assessing which patients are at high risk for future development of skeletal muscle atrophy. The approach is based on: 1) the known increase in de novo production of 3-methylhistidine (3MH) from muscle protein breakdown in said patients as a consequence of their unique disease-host interactions, and 2) earlier demonstration that de novo 3MH production can be measured in vivo using isotope dilution. We envision a relatively simple method that is totally non-invasive yet able to assess the course of skeletal muscle loss in cancer patients. The approach depends on the hypothesis that after an oral dose of deuterated 3-methylhistidine (D-3MH), the slope of the terminal portion of the decay curve (gt 12 hours post-dosing) for the tracer/tracee (D-3MH/3MH) in the free 3MH pool is directly proportional to the rate constant for myofibrillar protein degradation and can be determined from spot urine samples. During our Phase I research we established the feasibility of our overall approach by testing the following hypotheses in nine healthy adult males (four young, five older) by showing: (i) isotope enrichment in spot urine samples is identical with the corresponding plasma samples, (ii) meat intake up to and including the time of dosing does not influence the slope of the terminal portion of the isotope decay curve, and (iii) that the method is sufficiently sensitive to  measure differences in the rate of 3MH production between young and older individuals. Testing the validity of these hypotheses was the central focus of the Phase-I research and crucial to the development of an approach that is both scientifically sound as well as non-invasive and clinically relevant. During Phase-II, we propose to conduct a statistically powerful prospective investigation to demonstrate that measurementof slope of the terminal decay curve (rate constant) with our approach in newly diagnosed cancer patients predicts future development of muscle wasting. We expect the outcome of the combined Phase-I and Phase-II research to lead to the manufacture and marketing of a suitable   Test Kit   for early identification of elevated muscle catabolism in at-risk patients so that medical intervention can take place and prevent future muscle atrophy.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:      Project Narrative Skeletal muscle loss is an important, but unpredictable, occurrence in many patients with different types of cancer and other chronic diseases. Early assessment is important because it would permit selection of high risk patients for preventive strategies. Once a clinically significant amount of skeletal muscle is lost in these patients it cannot be reversed and has poor prognostic implications. The purpose of this project is to develop a non-invasive method for early assessment of increased skeletal muscle degradationin non-small cell lung cancer patients. As a group, these patients have a high likelihood of weight- and skeletal muscle loss, but the results are expected to be applicable to other cancer types in which weight-loss is an important component. Our approachis based on development of a (non-radioactive) stable isotope tracer approach to permit accurate quantitative measurement of skeletal muscle degradation early in the course of the disease by monitoring spot urine samples for the ratio of labeled/unlabeled3-methylhistidine the morning after consuming a small amount of labeled 3-methylhistidine along with a meat-free dinner.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term product goal of this project is a small molecule therapeutic to treat rheumatoid arthritis (RA), which acts by reducing the inflammatory response triggered by the pro-inflammatory cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF). Since MIF is an upstream regulator of the inflammatory cascade, small molecule therapeutics targeting MIF activity are expected to provide effective treatment for RA, which currently afflicts 4 million people in the US alone and for which there is no curative therapy. To this end, in Phase I of this SBIR project, we screened 200,000 compounds for MIF inhibitors and identified a number of small molecules that block MIF-driven cellular activation pathways that are associated withthe immunopathology of RA. For this proposal we selected two inhibitors that are structurally unique and possess functional groups that have not been previously associated with MIF inhibitory activity. They appear to interact with MIF by distinct mechanisms, and they are not cytotoxic to mammalian cells. In the continuation of this project, we propose to elucidate their precise mechanisms of action by obtaining MIF-inhibitor co-crystal structures. Further, using medicinal chemistry guided by structural data, we propose to obtain structure-activity relationships and modify the compounds to improve their MIF-inhibitory activities in an effort to obtain molecules that are efficacious in the RA mouse model. All of these efforts are expected to yield a lead compound suitable for further development towards a small molecule therapeutic for RA.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The goal of this project is to advance a promising small molecule compound towards development into a new drug for the treatment of rheumatoidarthritis (RA), a disease that afflicts up to 4 million people in the US. This compound appears to inhibit the inflammatory component of RA that is caused by the cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF). Since MIF acts upstream in the inflammatory cascade in RA, inhibition of this activity will address many of the downstream effector pathways that are ultimately responsible for joint destruction.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Scleroderma (also known as systemic sclerosis-SSc) is characterized primarily by progressive dermal and vascular fibrosis. Other organs are affected too, including lung, heart, blood vessels, GI and kidney. Many patients who suffer from scleroderma/SSc also have a loss of pulmonary function. Scleroderma/SSc affects approximately 400,000 to 900,000 people in the USA every year. Mortality and morbidity in SSc are very high and are directly related to the extent of fibrosis in the involved organs. According to one study, the total cost attributed to scleroderma/SSc in the USA reached  1.5 billion annually. In this study, morbidity represented the major cost burden, associated with  820 million (56%) of the total costs. There is no known cure for scleroderma/SSc and the underlying cause remains unknown, though it is attributed to having an autoimmune component. Treatment is currently limited to management of symptoms in order to improve quality of life and limit long-term complications. Common treatments for scleroderma/SSc include immunosuppressive agents, anti-inflammatory agents, vasodilators and anti-fibrotic agents. Immunosuppressive agents such as corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide have demonstrated marginal efficacy,or have side effects. Therefore there is a critical need for effective and affordable therapeutic strategy. Increased expression of both platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) and its receptors (PDGFR? and PDGFR?) have been demonstrated in skin of scleroderma patients. Furthermore, the possibility of PDGFR activation through auto-antibodies is a novel and provocative concept in autoimmune fibrotic diseases. Recent studies have indicated that another growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), apotent angiogenic molecule, is over expressed in SSc patients. From an extensive review of the literature, we concluded that inhibiting both PDGFR and KDR (VEGFRII) may be an effective novel therapeutic strategy to benefit scleroderma/SSc patients. We identified a small molecule receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor/s with activity against both PDGFR and KDR and optimized for solubility in Phase I program. We have characterized ANG- 3070 dual kinase inhibitor in vitro and in vivo and found that ANG3070 has significant anti-fibrotic activity in animal models of skin, lung and kidney fibrosis. The objective of the proposed new work under the SBIR Phase II program is to further expand the efficacy profile to identify the optimal dose and therapeutic time window in other preclinical animal models of SSc involving several organ fibrosis. These studies will aid in selecting the dose regimen and selecting SSc patient population for clinical studies regardless of etiology. We will also evaluate the safety/toxicology profile of ANG3070, in order to assemble a complete IND-enabling preclinical data package to submit to FDA for advancing to human studies.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Mortality and morbidity in scleroderma/SSc are very high and are directly related tothe extent of fibrosis in the involved organs. A small molecule anti-fibrotc compound will be an effective disease modifying therapy to significantly reduce scleroderma/SSc patient deaths with the devastating effects associated multiple organ fibrosis. Our small molecule represents a novel therapeutic approach for an incurable debilitating disease.",

Our Phase I studies established manufacturing and formulation conditions, and provided significant proof- of-concept data for theuse of MG53 in treating muscular dystrophy. This Phase II application proposed additional proof-of concept experiments in multiple dystrophy models (mouse, dog) and critical toxicology studies. This proposal will directly target the muscular dystrophies,a family of geneti disorders that generally include progressive muscle weakness due to degeneration of the muscle fibers that is linked to either fragility of the membranes that surround muscle cells or a compromised ability to reseal those membranes. An emerging concept in recent biomedical research establishes that intrinsic membrane repair/regeneration is a fundamental aspect of normal physiology and that disruption of this repair function underlies the progression of many human diseases, including muscular dystrophy. A therapeutic approach to increase the capacity of muscle cells to reseal their membranes following physiological levels of mechanical stress could address both of these mechanisms leading to improvement of the regenerative capacity in muscular dystrophy. Attempts to produce therapeutics targeting this unmet medical need have been complicated by the lack of knowledge of the molecular components involved.  Recent studies show that MG53, a muscle-specific TRIM-family protein, plays an essentialrole in protection of skeletal and cardiac muscle cells against various types of acute injury or chronic physiological stresses. MG53 ablation results in defective sarcolemmal membrane repair with progressive muscle pathology. In an effort to translate these basic science findings into therapeutic interventions for human diseases, we have formed a biotechnology company named TRIM-edicine, Inc, based on intellectual properties discovered at UMDNJ-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School. Our research and development effort at TRIM-edicine during Phase I of this SBIR project has established methods to produce large quantities of recombinant MG53 protein purified from E. coli that retains efficient membrane repair function. Furthermore, we produced in vivo animal model data using dystrophic mdx mice to show that intravenous (IV) delivery of recombinant MG53 can repair membrane damage to skeletal muscle and ameliorate the pathology associated with muscular dystrophy. Additional in vivo data show that repetitive IV-injections of recombinant human MG53 to mice are safe and do not produce adverse effects. Other studies showed that subcutaneous injection of MG53 can be effective for therapeutic approaches as well.  This project will leverage the expertise at TRIM-edicine in biologic drug development to pursue necessary studies for development of recombinant MG53 in treatment of muscular dystrophy to allow for the filing of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This PhaseII continuation project will involve a collaborative effort between TRIM-edicine and the University of North Carolina to pursue the proof-of-principle studies for the therapeutic application of MG53 in treatment of muscular dystrophy using the golden retriever model of muscular dystrophy. First, we will produce sufficient amount of recombinant dog MG53 proteins following our documented Chemical Manufacture Control (CMC) protocols. Second, we will test the efficacy and safety of the dog MG53 protein in reducing muscular pathology using a golden retriever with muscular dystrophy (GRMD) dog model. Third, upon completion of the in vivo animal model studies, the selection of animal species for the toxicology studies will be determined upon consultation with FDA in a pre-IND meeting. Completion of the safety/toxicology evaluations will provide the final step in preparation for filing of an IND application testing the use of recombinant MG53 in treatment of muscular dystrophy in human patients.

The discovery of MG53 as a key component of the muscle membrane repair machinery has opened a new therapeutic approach for treatment of muscular dystrophy.

For the younger patient, the treatment modalities have significant limitations. There are a growing number of new technologies and methodologies attempting to address articular cartilage repair, however there is no uniform method of assessing their safety and effectiveness or efficacy. The objective of this SBIR project is to establish ASTM Standard Methods (a large animal model and outcome measures) for assessing the safety and effectiveness or effectiveness of products for articular cartilage repair. There are multiple animal models for articular cartilage repair and regeneration, ranging from rodents to very large animals including horses. There are a large number of different analyses that can be performed used as outcome measures. This leadsto an inability to uniformly assess potential clinical performance, compare performance between potential therapies, or develop a consistent understanding of underlying mechanisms of repair. There is therefore a substantial need to develop an in vivo of assessing cartilage repair that can be used to support clinical studies, is consistent between users, and is clinically relevant. Our interdisciplinary team has substantial experience in using large animal models for cartilage repair, and recently we and others have successfully used the goat as a method of assessing cartilage repair. Team members have also established a number of key outcome measures that are valuable in providing a quantitative assessment of cartilage repair. Our team also has substantial experience in developing ASTM standards. We therefore propose to combine the animal model expertise, the analytical expertise, and the standards expertise, to generate a set of standard methods for cartilage repair, which are shown to be reproducible between research centers, and can generate uniform data that is appropriate for submission to the FDA to support initiation of clinical studies. The goals of the Phase I project have been achieved. The Phase II project will (a) characterize the animal model up to 12 months after surgery, (b) validate the model and complete the ASTM standard for the model, (c) develop ASTM standards for quantitative outcome measures in biochemistry, bioengineering, and imaging. Specific Aim 1. Characterize the goat model of osteochondral defect and repair at 3, 6 and 12 months. Specific Aim 2. Demonstrate reproducibility of the animal model and complete the ASTM Standard Method. Specific Aim 3. Validate methods and develop ASTM standards for outcome measures.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Kidney stones are a common and painful human health care problem worldwide. Of all stones developed approximately 75% are composed of calcium oxalate. Urinary oxalate is regarded as a driving force for calcium oxalate stone formation, and absorption of dietary oxalate contributes to 10-70% of urinary oxalate. In fact, roughly 2.4 million Americans (0.75% of the US population) have either enteric or absorptive hyperoxaluria and suffer from recurrent calcium oxalate stoneformation. Treatment strategies that significantly reduce the absorption of dietary oxalate and subsequently decrease risk of stone formation are limited if not non- existent. The approach underlying the SBIR Phase I portion of this project was to find anoxalate-degrading enzyme from natural sources (edible fungi) with the ideal properties to be a potential therapeutic, medical food or dietary supplement:  stable and active at pH 2.0-5.0, intracellular and/or associated with cell walls, and capable to degrade most available ingested oxalate in the human stomach within the gastric emptying time. Captozyme was successful at finding two enzymes with more than ideal properties. In fact, these enzymes were naturally protected from pepsin degradation, stable at acidic conditions below the pH 2.0 threshold, stable to temperatures approaching 77oC, and the oxalate-degrading enzyme content was successfully increased to 150 units of activity per gram of dry material for one fungal species. Recently, OxDC content fromshake flask and fermenter growths was further increased to approximately 600 and 250 units per gram of dry material from one fungal species, respectively, by using unconventional OxDC inducing strategies. The Phase II specific aims are 1) to increase OxDCactivity in the dry fungal material obtained from the fermenter process to further reduce dose size, improve patient compliance, and decrease manufacturing costs; 2.) Finish all necessary preparations to establish an early cGMP production process and manufacture five batches at pilot scale; and 3.) Conduct pre-clinical studies to evaluate product safety and demonstrate proof of principle in a dog model. At the conclusion of a successful SBIR Phase II grant Captozyme expects to have all necessary informationfor a GRAS evaluation and to conduct a clinical trial. The product established by way of this project will ideally be taken with meals and oxalate containing snacks and will likely have a wide application within the calcium oxalate stone- forming population.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Kidney stones are a common and painful human health care problem. In Western countries including the United States, approximately 75% of all stones are composed of calcium oxalate, and roughly a third of these casesoriginate from recurrent stone formers who experience some degree of elevated urinary oxalate levels (hyperoxaluria). Roughly 2.4 million Americans have either enteric or absorptive hyperoxaluria and are capable of responding to dietary restrictions. Currently there is no treatment strategy that is effective a degrading dietary oxalate and subsequently reducing the recurrence of these kidney stones. Therefore, the overall goal of this project is to develop an oxalate-degrading enzyme that can effectively act as a dietary intercept and hence reduce the occurrence of calcium oxalate stone development in these patient populations.",

We have developed and tested a novel instrument (StromaGlide) and test (Connective Tissue Motion Measure - CTMM) -quantifying the functional behavior of perimuscular connective tissues. The results of preliminary data strongly suggest that CTMM is reduced in chronic LBP. In this project, we plan to further testthe performance of the CTMM as a biomarker in cross sectional and longitudinal studies of humans with and without LBP. We will also improve the commercial viability of the project by upgrading device components with less expensive (but equally well performing) FDA compliant subcomponents. Aim 1: Comparison of CTMM (test) in LBP vs No-LBP: We will follow up on the results of Phase 1 with a fully powered comparison of CTMM across 144 subjects, 72 with LBP and 72 with No-LBP. LBP and No-LBP groups will be frequency-matched for age, sex and BMI. In each subject, CTMM will be measured once bilaterally in the back. Based on our preliminary results, we hypothesize that CTMM will be reduced on average in the LBP group. Aim 2: Within-subject correlation of short term repeated CTMM: We will assess the stability of CTMM over repeated short term measurements. All LBP and No-LBP subjects tested in Aim 1 (N=144) will be re-tested one hour and one day following the initial test. We hypothesize that the CTMM will be reliable with an intra class correlation (ICC) greater than 0.8. Aim 3: Relationship of CTMM to clinical measures: All LBP subjects tested in Aim 1 (N=72) will also be evaluated with established measures of LBP symptoms and impairment. We hypothesize that CTMM will negatively correlate with the numeric pain index, McGill pain score, Oswestry disability index and functional measure score (50 foot walk, repeated sit-to-stand and repeated forward bend). All LBP subjects tested in Aim 1 (N=72) will also be retested 9months and 15 months later along with repeated assessment of symptoms and impairment (target n=60; 20% attrition allowance). We hypothesize that CTMM will be a significant time-varying covariate in predicting temporal changes in the functional and disability tests. Aim 4: Upgrade StromaGlide components to decrease manufacturing costs and adopt an FDA compliant design: We will substitute principal subsystems with low-cost, custom designed FDA compliant components suitable for commercialization. This will notalter device performance, rather it will reduce estimated manufacturing costs of these subsystems significantly. Upgraded device performance will be verified to match existing specifications.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The success of this projectpromises to improve the treatment of musculoskeletal disorders such as chronic idiopathic low back pain by providing an objective means for identifying connective tissue pathology. This would make a significant clinical impact by providing physicians, payers, and patients with much-needed information to improve the treatment of the large group of patients who suffer from costly chronic idiopathic musculoskeletal pain and dysfunction.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As the second most common cause of death in the US, cancer is caused by random mutations in an organism&#039;s genome. Although precise knowledge of the genomic sequence within neoplastic tissues can be an indicator for treatment, for example the erbB-2 receptor gene (Her-2) for breast cancer, such correlations are few and often do not adequately define tumor subtypes important in therapeutic decisions. Such inability to identify a subclass of tumors which may not respond tostandard therapies can restrict the development of more efficacious treatment strategies. The analysis of gene expression represents an indirect measure of the genetic alterations in tumors through the analysis of regulatory pathways. Microarray technologies have proven to be powerful tools and offer the promise of better clinical decision-making based on tumor phenotypes. Highly promising preliminary studies of leukemia, lymphomas, and solid neoplasms demonstrate that gene expression data can highlight differences between otherwise histologically identical diseases. However, microarray-based technologies are limited in their ability to analyze low expression levels. We use of a unique sequencing by synthesis technology as a digital gene expression system toobtain precise counts of expressed mRNA molecules. This can provide an order of magnitude more sensitivity than microarray systems. In this Phase II project, we will build upon the sample preparation protocols developed in Phase I and use these with an extremely low-cost, proprietary, next-generation sequencing system that can perform the sequencing required for a gene expression study for about  100 or about 1/20th the price of the most competitive sequencing method.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Ultimately, the ability to produce very inexpensive gene expression and detailed DNA sequence information related to cancer will lead for a much wider use of expression and sequence analyses for research and treatment of this devastating disease. In addition, the ability to analyze complex organisms&#039; genomes at a very low cost will both lead to accelerated discoveries throughout biology and provide the basis for Pharmacogenomics, a new paradigm in therapeutics wherein medicines are prescribed based on individualgenotypes rather than just observed symptoms.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Kaposi&#039;s sarcoma herpes virus (KSHV) also known as human herpes virus 8 (HHV-8) causes several cancers including Kaposi&#039;s sarcoma, primarily in immune-compromised patients. HHV-8 has been shown to be transmitted sexually, through saliva, and through infected blood and organs to recipients. While a number of serological assays have been devised in the research setting to detect HHV-8 infection, there are no FDA-approved assays. Furthermore, there is no   gold standard   diagnostic assay for HHV-8 infection and none are of adequate sensitivity and specificity to be used commercially for diagnostic or blood screening purposes. Nevertheless, these assays have revealed that as much as 3 to 5% of US blood donors have been infected with HHV-8, and some high-risk populations such as homosexual men, the HHV-8 prevalence is as high as 65%. Thus, there is a need for a commercial diagnostic to identify HHV-8 infected individuals to prevent further transmission of this virus within thegeneral population and immune-compromised individuals as well as into the general blood supply. The overall goal of this project is to develop a sensitive and specific serological multi-antigen assay for the detection of HHV-8 antibodies that can be usedcommercially to diagnose at-risk patients and identify blood/tissue donors with HHV-8 infection. Epiphany&#039;s first-generation HHV-8 enzyme- linked immunosorbent assay diagnostic (ELISA), composed of a single antigen assay and a dual antigen assay, provide gt80% sensitivity and 96% specificity in identifying HHV-8 infected individuals and thus one of the more sensitive diagnostics. However, to be a commercial success, the sensitivity and specificity needs to be improved which we propose by improving the quality and number of capture antigens. In our Phase I grant, we demonstrated the feasibility of our approach by identifying an improved K8.1 capture antigen expressed in a eukaryotic system. To further optimize the assay for commercial use, we will in Aim 1 expand our search for both improved and new capture antigens, then in Aim 2 we will develop a multi-antigen assay. In Aim 3 we will conduct pilot-scale production and beta testing of the diagnostic assay to determine the specificity and sensitivity of the assay by retrospective testing of clinical blood samples. Achieving the goals in this project would generate a commercial HHV-8 diagnostic test which will identify infected patients and donors to reduce transmission risk and to make the blood supply safer.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Infection with the herpes virus HHV-8, only discovered in 1994, may cause several cancers including Kaposi&#039;s sarcoma, especially in patients with weak immune systems such as those with HIV. HHV-8 can be transmitted sexually, through saliva, and via blood and organ donations and approximately up to 5% of blood donors in the US have been infected with HHV-8. The project proposes to develop for commercialization a blood test to identify HHV-8 infected individuals thereby providing a diagnosis for infected individuals to understand their risk and modify their behavior as well as make the blood supply much safer for high-risk individuals and blood recipients in general.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is an urgent need for early-detection cancer biomarkers which can significantly lower the high mortality and cost of treating cancer. One of the most promising candidates for such biomarkers is tumor-associated autoantigens (TAA), autoantibodies to which have been detected in patient&#039;s blood even in the early stages of cancer. In addition to use in early diagnosis, such TAAs have great value in developing anti-cancer vaccines and potentially guiding individualizedpatient therapy. One general approach to TAA discovery is screening the sera of patients having particular cancers against proteome-scale libraries of human proteins, to detect autoantibody binding. However, large-scale proteomic screens are difficult to perform using conventional technology, such as protein microarrays, due to limited sensitivity, reproducibility, scalability and expense of manufacture. An additional problem is the reliance on attachment and drying of the bait protein onto planar microarray substrates, which damages proteins, impairs the subsequent bio-assay kinetics and reduces the amount of accessible bait protein. During Phase I, we have made significant progress towards overcoming these limitations through the development of a next generation approach to proteomics, termed Bead-based Global Proteomic Screening (Bead-GPSTM). Bead-Protein libraries are produced inexpensively and rapidly using cell-free protein expression and uniformly attached to beads. Bio-assays are performed with the beads in suspension for improved kinetics. The bead library is then randomly arrayed into Pico-well slides with a capacity of up to 1-million beads. The strength of positive bait-prey interactions on the bead is quantitatively measured using fluorescence imaging and then the bead identity decoded using photocleavable mass tags combined with MALDI mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI), which provides the ability to decode tens of thousands of different bead species. During Phase I we have achieved all key milestones including: i) full production and validation of a prototype 100- member protein library based on cell-free expression methods, and, formatting the library on beads; ii) development and evaluation of an ultra-high density bead-array platform including decoding using MALDI-MSI; iii) successful screening of the prototype bead-protein library with several model autoantigens; iv) discovery and validation of a new TAA for CRC on the Bead-GPSTM platform by using candidate pre-selection with ultra-low noisegene expression profiling; v) demonstration of a MALDI-MSI bead barcoding system capable of generating tens of thousands of unique codes using lt 50 distinguishable mass tags; vi) successful screening of 94 CRC sera and controls using a model bead-proteinlibrary on Illumina&#039;s mid-plex automated VeraCodeTM platform. During the Phase II project we will continue to develop and evaluate Bead-GPSTM with special focus on the discovery of TAA biomarkers for colorectal cancer (CRC). For this purpose we will initially fabricate an intermediate 500-member library including known CRC TAAs from the literature, high probability TAAs and those discovered in Phase I. The library will be screened using Bead-GPSTM against CRC patient sera and matched controls including individuals with benign polyps and benign inflammatory diseases. Rigorous SOPs for serum collection/handling developed by an NCI (EDRN) consensus working group for biomarker discovery will be implemented by both our commercial (ABS) and institutional (Boston Medical Center) suppliers (see letters), and assisted by consultant M. Tuck, who helped spearhead the EDRN effort (see letter). For comparison, similar measurements will be run using the VeraCodeTM digital holographic bead technology in collaboration with Illumina Inc., who has agreed to provide the instrumentation (BeadXpress  ) and reagents (see letter; note that AmberGen has won the Illumina Assay Design Challenge for Proteomics on VeraCode   beads). The 500-member protein library will be followed by a 5,000-member library later in Phase II. To accelerate commercialization, we will work closely with Illumina in order to implement clinical multipanel assays on its VeraCodeTM system, as well as with INOVA and Bio-Rad Diagnostics, two leaders in development of clinical immunoassays (see letters). Finally, we will work closely during Phase II with Bruker Daltonics Inc., which has expressed interest in developing an integrated instrument for Bead-GPSTM.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The discovery of blood based early-detection cancer biomarkers can significantly reduce the high mortality rate of cancer. However, current techniques for discovery of such biomarkers, such as tumor associated antigens, are slow and unreliable. During Phase I we have developed a novel, low-cost, high-sensitivity and high-throughput proteomic approach for cancer biomarker discovery termed Bead-based Global Proteomic Screening (Bead-GPSTM). During Phase II we will evaluate the ability of this new approach to discover novel biomarkersfor the early, non-invasive, blood based diagnosis of colorectal cancer, the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S.",

        "abstract": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Through Phase I and II SBIR NCI support, Omniox has developed a breakthrough oxygen carrying protein, OMX-4.80, that delivers oxygen to tumors and greatly reduces hypoxia. This Phase IIB proposal describes IND-enabling studies andPhase 1b clinical trials in certain cancers, with the potential to expand to a range of other hypoxic solid cancers, to enhance radiation therapy (RT). Backed by leaders in the field of tumor hypoxia and RT, and led by experts in protein-based oxygen carriers and oncology drug development, Omniox is focused on translating promising preclinical data of OMX-4.80 into patients. Omniox has received commitments from high net worth investors and venture capital groups to match NCI funding for ~ 1million per yearfor three years; the initial series A termsheet describes a  1million funding commitment that is conditional on the funding of this proposal.  Hypoxia, a common feature of solid tumors, is considered a major obstacle for the clinical management of cancerby radiation therapy (radiotherapy, RT). Oxygen is required by ionizing radiation to damage DNA and kill cancer cells. Cancer patients with significantly hypoxic tumors tend to have a poor prognosis for survival. Given the clinical relevance of hypoxia, along-time objective in the field of RT has been to effectively radiosensitize solid tumors by attenuating or exploiting this pathophysiological state.  The heme-nitric oxide/oxygen-binding (H-NOX) proteins were initially discovered at the University of California, Berkeley and are exclusively licensed to Omniox for therapeutic development. H-NOX are neutral towards nitric oxide (NO), comparing favorably with the high NO reactivity and hypertensive properties of hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers; can be tunedto achieve specific oxygen affinities; are structurally stable above 80  C, and chemically stable for weeks at room temperature; and can be surface-modified to alter size, oncotic properties, or tissue targeting. Preclinical data on the lead H-NOX, OMX-4.80, established that it demonstrates clinically relevant tumor biodistribution after IV administration, and significantly reduces hypoxia over multiple hours. Additionally, in orthotopic tumor models, the lead candidate generated a significant reduction intumor growth and an extension in overall survival when coupled with RT. Finally, in toxicity testing, the H-NOX protein demonstrated a strong safety profile, without any of the significant safety or toxicity concerns that have plagued other tumor oxygenation technologies. This Phase IIB proposal has been prepared in accordance with guidelines for developing radiation enhancement therapies (DIRM report) as published by the NCI s Radiation Modifier Working Group and describes the continued preclinical research, safety testing, and clinical development through Phase 1 trials. Successful completion of this study should result in significant investor interest in supporting further clinical development.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): X-ray mammography continues to be the primary tool for breast cancer screening and plays an important role in the diagnosis and management of breast cancer. However, the difficulty in resolving overlapping structures ina 2-D projection image leads to reduced sensitivity. A number of research groups and companies are developing dedicated breast tomographic systems to overcome this problem. Most of the systems are based on the conventional mammographic tube mounted on a rotating gantry. These systems have long acquisition times and are hence prone to motion blur. Here we propose to develop a prototype digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) system based on our novel digitally addressable x-ray source (DAXS) panels in collaboration with M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC). The DAXS uses an innovative flat panel architecture in which field emission current from arrays of cold cathode field emitters formed in pixel configurations on the source exit window generates x-ray flux froma target opposite the exit window. The flux then passes through the emitters, out the window and on to the subject. The metal x-ray target is a broad, flat sheet which forms part of the vacuum envelope. Depending on the pitch between emitters, over 10,000emitters can be patterned per mm2. We have demonstrated in Phase I, currents of over 100 5A from single emitters, so high current densities (e.g. 300 mA per mm2, or about 30 mA from the typical 0.3 mm spot size in mammography) are possible. Pixel flux levels can be modulated over a broad range by varying the emitter cathode-gate voltage. The ability to address x-ray pixels, and vary intensity, will offer new flexibility in delivering precise amounts of x-ray flux to target locations for dose modulation. Pixel address speeds are well under a few milliseconds, so motion blurring will be reduced. The flat panel architecture of the DAXS also allows the x-ray source to shift two dimensionally enabling the out-of-focal plane objects to be more effectively blurredwith a 2-D kernel. Here we will build up on our Phase I efforts and construct several DAXS panels to be incorporated into a prototype DBT system along with a commercially available flat panel detector. The proposed DBT system will lead to a new generationof compact, fast, affordable and transportable breast tomographic systems for breast cancer screening, diagnosis and management. The primary impact of the proposed work will be to make breast cancer screening more accessible and convenient, and provide motion- free 3-D breast images to radiologists, surgeons, radiation oncologists, for better detection, diagnosis and staging of breast cancers.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The prototype digital breast tomosynthesis system to be developed here is based onnovel digitally addressable x-ray source panels which offer unique capabilities not available with current mammography x-ray sources. Since the x-ray pixels can be addressed electronically in few milliseconds no gantry motion is required and these can helpreduce exposure time and dose and eliminate motion blurring problems associated with 3-D imaging. Such a device will make 3-D imaging mobile and affordable making more widely available to practitioners new tools and methodologies for early detection and more accurate diagnosis of breast cancer.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop and demonstrate a novel microfluidic device and assay for selection and optimization of delivery vehicles, specifically non-viral vectors for drug delivery to tumors. Tumor drug delivery is a complex phenomenon affected by several elements in addition to drug or delivery vehicle&#039;s physico-chemical properties. A key factor is tumor microvasculature with complex effects including convective transport, high interstitial pressure and enhanced vascular permeability due to the presence of   leaky vessels  . Current in vitro models of tumor drug delivery are oversimplified and, as a result, show poor correlation with in vivo performance. We propose to develop a novel microfluidic platform that models the tumor microenvironment more accurately, with physiologically and morphologically realistic microvasculature including endothelial cell lined leaky capillary vessels along with 3D solid tumors. This device will allow real-time, quantitative assessment of theperformance of delivery vehicles under in vivo like conditions. In Phase I, we designed and fabricated prototypes of plastic microfluidic chips with embedded microvascular networks with leaky gaps. Endothelial cells and 3D spheroids of cervical tumor cellswere co-cultured in the networks. Drug vehicle screening was successfully demonstrated using gene delivery nanopolymers. Planned Phase II enhancements include optimization of leaky vasculature in addition to extension of the device for culture of breast,ovary and lung tumor cells. The ability of the microfluidic device for screening of drug delivery vehicle screening for targeted drug delivery and the role of particle shape for delivery in addition to gene delivery wil be investigated. A multi-disciplinary (engineering and biology), industry-academic team with substantial expertise has been assembled for successful execution of this challenging project. The developed device will have critical applications both in basic research, where it can be used to develop next generation delivery vehicles, and in drug discovery where it can be used to study drug efficacy in realistic tumor microenvironment. The product will be commercialized to pharmaceutical/biotech firms, drug research labs and universities/non-profit centers engaged in cancer research and drug delivery.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this Phase II SBIR project is to continue development of an exciting platform based on integration of optical coherence tomography acquisition with real-time 3D spatial localization. In Phase I, in the context of gynecological diagnostic imaging, we demonstrated hardware and software for prototype image fusion between colposcopic/intravaginal imaging and OCT images of the cervix. We also demonstrated a promising methodology for simplified acquisition of 3D OCT data sets which may have broad application. In this project, we build upon these promising results to define and develop two new products. The first will be a clinical tracking and software system which augments an OCT imaging system to provide fusion between OCT and colposcopic images as well as tools for analyzing, reviewing, and reporting image findings. The second will consist of software and an imaging/tracking probe which can be readily coupled (by an end user) to commercially available OCT systemsand which, when installed, will allow reconstruction of 3D OCT datasets from simple manually scanned 2D data. Devices will be validated in phantoms and animal models as well as clinically. While this application continues to be focused on gynecological diagnosis, we will also lay important experimental groundwork for future development of this technology in other fields.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In 2010, approximately 12,200 cases of invasive cervical cancer are expected to be diagnosed in the United States, and it is estimated that incidence of noninvasive cervical cancer (carcinoma in situ) is about four times as high [://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/types/cervical]. Approximately 4,210 women are expected to die from cervical cancer in the United States during 2010. Though mortality rates associated with cervical cancer have decreased dramatically over the last 50 years, the incidence of cervical precancers has increased, and it has been suggested that without improvement in current screening and diagnostic techniques, mortality rates associated with cervical carcinoma could increase, especially if human papilloma virus (HPV) seroprevalence continues to rise.  Early detection of cervical precancerous lesions can have a dramatic impact on cervical cancer mortality rates, increasing five- year survival rates from 70% to about 100%. This project focuses on development of a novel imaging system for improving diagnosis and characterization of cervical tissue. The developed technology also has wide application in other diagnostic fields including cardiology, laparoscopy, and gastroenterology.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop an operating-room-ready system for needle guidance in soft tissue, which fuses intra- operative ultrasound and pre-operative X-ray computed tomography (CT) data by combining two novel technologies:1) a radically different way of visualizing and interacting with the fused ultrasound and CT images, which we call Spotlight  ; and 2) an innovative algorithm that automatically and continuously performs ultrasound-to-CT registration. Conventional image guidance during surgery has several problems. For example, intra-operative ultrasound guidance gives real-time feedback about the patient&#039;s anatomy, but some tumors are only visible in CT, which offers a higher resolution (and a larger 3D volume). On the other hand, a CT scan of soft tissue becomes obsolete as soon as the organs move by even a small amount, for example, due to breathing. The two modalities are usually viewed on separate monitors, which amplifies another problem: the appearance of anatomicalfeatures is usually different in ultrasound and in CT, and there is no visual correspondence between them. Furthermore, the pre-operative annotations of the CT-indicating the locations of tumors or lesions-cannot be seen in the context of the ultrasound. In this proposal, we address these problems by developing a guidance system that: 1) registers and fuses pre- operative CT with intra-operative ultrasound; 2) dynamically volume-renders the CT scan and its pre-operative annotations in such a way as to highlight the most relevant portions of the dataset given the position of the ultrasound transducer and needle, while still indicating the remaining portions of the dataset for context; and 3) allows for intra-operative annotation to both modalities. To this end, we propose to refine and evaluate Spotlight iteratively, using phantoms and human patients. We also propose to develop a novel ultrasound-to- CT registration technique, to make it suitable for real-time operation during interventions, and to evaluate it, integrated with Spotlight, on human patients. For the evaluation, we will initially deploy the system in open surgical microwave ablation of liver tumors, but the technology is not limited to that specific intervention. In the future, it would be  adapted to any procedure in which needles, ultrasound and pre-operative scans such as CT or MRI are employed. Our proposed system has potential to dramatically improve the utility of CT in the operating room, increasing the likelihood of an effective, efficientand complete intervention and improved patient outcome.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to develop a system that registers and visualizes pre-operative CT and intra-operative ultrasound images during surgical interventions. This system provides to the surgeon a combination of the two modalities&#039; benefits while negating each other&#039;s shortcomings, allowing him to more effectively and efficiently perform the intervention. The surgeon can also make intra-operative annotations to both modalities with our system, so that he can mark all tumors that he intends to treat. Patient benefits of such a system will include shorter operating time, reduced risk of injury, and increased probability of complete tumor removal, in a variety of interventions, such as ablation, biopsy, and drug delivery.",

Unlike other forms of breast cancer, no targeted therapy exists for triple negative tumors. Unfortunately, triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) can be particularlyaggressive and more likely to recur than other breast cancer subtypes, resulting in an increased risk of death. Eukaryotic mRNAs possess a unique capped 5&#039;-end (m7GpppN) that is required for initiation of protein synthesis known as cap-dependent translation and in normal cells, is tightly controlled. Deregulation of cap-dependent translation can lead to uncontrolled growth, a hallmark of cancer cells. A prime target of protein synthesis control is the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), best known forts function in the initiation of protein synthesis on m7GpppN capped mRNAs in the cell. A high percentage of triple negative breast tumors have high levels of eIF4E expression and elevated levels of eIF4E have been shown to correlate with higher rates of recurrence and increased risk of death. Because high levels of eIF4E represent high rates of cap-dependent translation; the focus of this proposal is on compounds that selectively inhibit cap-dependent translation of proteins In Phase I of this proposal, NovoMedix demonstrated in vivo safety and efficacy of three novel inhibitors of cap-dependent translation in animal models of triple negative breast cancer. A patent has been applied for that covers two of these compounds (composition of matter patent for the treatment, prevention, and/or amelioration of various disorders, including cancer) and NovoMedix is currently working on a patent application for the third compound. In Phase II of this proposal, NovoMedix will perform additional in vitro safety testingon these first  in-class therapeutics to identify potential cardiac and hemolytic risks and identify potent drug interactions; to further delineate the mechanism-of-action by which these drugs effectively kill cancer cells in TNBC mouse models; and performexploratory and definitive preclinical studies to determine dosing range, dosing route (oral or i.v.), and dosing schedule in support of an IND and to advance one or more of these drugs into clinical trials. The specific aims for this Phase II  proposal are: 1) to assess cardiac risks and identify potential drug-drug interactions, 2) to identify the mechanism of inhibition of cap-dependent translation initiation, 3) , select a safe an effective route of administration, dosing range, and dosing schedule ina triple negative breast cancer model, 4) conduct analytical characterization, formulation, and GMP scale-up to support GLP preclinical studies and Phase I/II clinical trials, and 5) perform GLP toxicity and toxicokinetic studies in two relevant species toidentify an appropriate starting dose for use in first-in-human Phase I/II clinical trials.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  StemSynergy Therapeutics Inc. (SSTI) is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development, and commercialization of drugs that target pathways fundamental to stem cells and cancer stem cells. The WorldHealth Organization estimates that over 12 million cases of cancer were diagnosed in 2007 and that nearly 8 million cancer patients will die of their disease. Colorectal cancer (CRC) represents the third most common cause of death due to cancer with 610,000 deaths. Activating mutations in the Wnt signaling pathway are the earliest events in the genesis of CRC, and, remarkably, are present in over 90% of all cases. There is an urgent need for inhibitors of the Wnt pathway for the treatment of colorectal cancer and other Wnt- driven cancers. Currently, there are no FDA-approved drugs or drugs in late-stage clinical trials that target this pathway. SSTI has developed a powerful biochemical screen to identify Wnt inhibitors utilizing two independent readouts ofthe Wnt pathway. By assessing the stability of two Wnt pathway proteins, 2-catenin and Axin in a high- throughput screen, SSTI has identified small molecules that regulate Wnt signaling via activation of Casein Kinase 1a. Using a novel approach to lead optimization, SSTI has developed a new series of lead compounds that have more drug-like properties. Our successful Phase I SBIR project demonstrated that these compounds potently inhibit Wnt signaling, decrease the viability of a variety of human CRC cell lines, have good ADMET properties, and show in vivo efficacy. Additionally, SSTI was able to develop a secondary (backup series) using medicinal chemistry. Both classes of small molecules represent new chemical entities and our Phase II application outlinesthe next logical steps in their development by optimizing metabolism, demonstrating efficacy and performing safety studies in rodent and non-rodent. Our overall goal of this Phase II project is to demonstrate all of the necessary properties for IND submission according to the FDA guidance (ICH S9) for clinical trials of advanced colorectal cancer. Because there are no drugs on the market that target the Wnt pathway, SSTI has the potential to improve and prolong the lives of millions of cancer patients worldwide. In summary, SSTI has the opportunity to bring to the market the first generation of Wnt inhibitors and capture a significant share of the global market for cancer drugs.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Colorectal cancer is responsible for 1.2 million cases and 610,000 deaths each year. The Wnt pathway is a major growth pathway that plays a critical role in gt90% of all cases and there are currently no inhibitors in the clinic. We intend to develop our lead compound Wnt pathway inhibitors through pre-clinical and clinical trials for a treatment of colorectal cancer.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The American Cancer Society estimates that more than 1.5 million new cancer victims will be diagnosed this year in the U.S., and that ~572,000 Americans will die of cancer in 2011.1 More than 13 million Americans are living today with a history of cancer, and this number is heading toward 18 million by 2020.1 Beyond the human costs in lives, productivity, and quality of life, the NIH estimated cancer&#039;s direct medical costs t  103 billion in 2010, with total costs being263 billion.1-2 Clearly, adequate drug therapy is not  yet available, and we need better ways to rapidly develop and test new drugs. At the heart of the problem is a   one size fits all   approach to research that is not aligned to a cancer population comprised of hundreds of rare treatment indications spread among thousands of separate practices? Innovations are needed to deliver greater access to patients and to connect the right patients to the right clinical trials at the right time. We need to get next-generation cancer drugs from benchtop to the clinic-faster and at a lower cost-and the Obama administration&#039;s ambitious plans to double federal funding for cancer research within five years and to also double enrollment in U.S. cancer clinical trials is certainly in jeopardy given the current budget situation.3 Pharmatech Oncology is addressing this critical need via research system innovations that increase access to patients for participation in clinical trials. Our Just-n-Time (JIT) research system being developed in this multi- phase SBIR project is designed to closely align and coordinate U.S. clinical research with cancer patient care. Our strong Phase I results demonstrate that the feasibility of using JIT is a superior methodology for conducting clinical trials in indications where patients are potentially rare and highly embedded in a large care system. Those results set the stage for this Phase II project, which is focused upon completing the system development, optimization, standardization, and customer interactive infrastructure needed to offer the JIT research service through a website portal product, the   Pharmatech Nexus.   The Pharmatech RandD team will pursue the following Phase II Aims: 1) Develop and demonstrate optimized JIT workflow andeconomics at research site level; 2) Develop and implement tools to standardize the JIT methodology; 3) Develop a business platform to drive scalability and expanded connectivity; and 4) Prove the integration of JIT methodology with molecular screening. Building on the concepts proven in Phases I and II, a new means of conducting clinical trials will be made broadly available. When fully developed by the expert Pharmatech team, the Pharmatech Nexus platforms will 1) make a large number of clinical trials,spanning multiple indications and treatment stages, available to oncologists for their patients; 2) provide a conduit for molecular testing to identify which targeted investigationl therapies may be appropriate; and 3) enable individual patients to enrollin the right trials very quickly and to receive research-based care on a schedule that accommodates their need to be treated.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: As more-effective precision therapeutics become available to directly target the molecular causes of cancers, the costs and challenges of bringing a new generation of highly effective drugs from benchtop to clinic are escalating. The end goal of this multi-phase SBIR project is to establish a new, patient-centered clinical research system that is aligned with cancer patient care in the U.S. and to vastly expand patient/physician access to clinical trials as treatment options for individual patients. The Phase II work proposed here will position Pharmatech Oncology to lead a unique, collaborative marketplace initiative designed to drive cancer patient participation in clinical trials from 3% to 10% by 2020, enabling approval of next-generation cancer drugs more rapidly and at a lower cost.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): BioElectroMed is developing a new medical device called the EndoPulse   that works in conjunction with an echoendoscope to deliver nanosecond pulsed electric field therapy to treat pancreatic carcinoma as well as lesions in the kidney and liver. The EndoPulse   is designed to penetrate through the stomach wall into a pancreatic carcinoma before extending an electrode array on both sides of the tumor. We are also developing a high voltage model of the PulseCure   nanosecond pulse generator that can generate 30 kV/cm between the two electrode arrays, exposing the entire tumor to this field strength. We have determined that the application of 500 pulses 100 ns long and 30 kV/cm in amplitude triggers apoptosis in all the human tumor cells between the electrodes and causes them to self-destruct within two weeks. We propose to complete the design and testing of both the EndoPulse   and PulseCure   prototypes and have the final versions manufactured under GMP for use in human clinical trials. These two instruments will then be used to ablate small regions of pancreas in pigs to demonstrate safety and efficacy prior to submitting the application to the FDA for an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) required for the clinical trial. Once the IDE is granted, we will conduct a six-patient feasibility clinical trial at Stanford University Medical Center with Drs. Ann Chen and Subhas Banerjee acting as Co-Principal Investigators of this trial. These two gastroenterologists receive 3-4patients per month with non-resectable pancreatic carcinomas for which there is currently no effective therapy. If the PulseCure  -EndoPulse   system can reliably ablate pancreatic carcinomas, it would offer the first effective, non-surgical therapy for pancreatic cancer that could extend the lives of tens of thousands of patients each year.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This research will develop a breakthrough, minimally invasive approach to the treatment of pancreatic tumors for which current treatment options are poor and costly. This new medical device called the EndoPulse is readily extendable to treat other focal internal lesions especially in the liver, kidney and lymph nodes. The EndoPulse is guided to the internal tumor by ultrasound imaging inan echoendoscope and applies ultrashort electrical pulses that cause the tumor cells to self-destruct.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Aptamers are nucleic acid based affinity reagents that can be selected in vitro from large combinatorial libraries. As an affinity reagent they have inherent advantages as they are chemically synthesized, thermostable,immunologically neutral, significantly cheaper than antibody reagents and can be evolved for both specificity and affinity. Conversely, the process to generate useful aptamer reagents is lengthy, requiring significant experience and time to generate a useful reagent; frequently months for 8-15 rounds of library selection. Therefore, despite the promise of aptamer technology and the notable success of aptamer therapeutics in the short time the technology has been available, the threshold for entry into thisfield is inhibited by this labor-intensive process and mixed success. Phase I feasibility  studies showed that DNA aptamers with low nanomolar dissociation constants (Kd lt  3 nM) can be generated in just 3 rounds of selection, since extended to 5 proteins. This work has clearly shown the feasibility of our technology. From this foundation, this application will help fund commercialization of this aptamer selection platform, the reagents and protocol. We expect that successful commercialization will have amajor impact on the advancement of diagnostics, therapeutics, and the emerging proteomics applications where reagent demands far outstrip supply. Provide key words (8 maximum) to identify the research or technology. aptamer, Pro-SELEX, affinity, selection,Provide a brief summary of the potential commercial applications of the research. The Pro-SELEX platform and sequencing protocol 60-80% both the workload and chance of failure for selection of aptamer affinity reagents. This generates a significantly moreappealing approach to aptamer selection likely to expand the application of this technology into proteomics and diagnistic reagents.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Aptamers are molecular recognition molecules analogous to monoclonal antibodies except that they are made in test tubes using nucleic acid libraries. They have demonstrated enormous diversity and potential since they were first used 20 years ago, but they are very time consuming and troublesome to develop. This project describes a platform that standardizes and automates generation of aptamer reagents. It has to potential to significantly accelerate the development of aptamer tools for use in drug delivery, therapeutics as well as basic research and diagnostic sciences.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The prevalence of nutrition-related conditions (overweight/obesity, cancer, diabetes, heart disease, etc.) among Americans is widely documented. During the last twenty years, the frequency of dining out has increased, with Americans currently eating restaurant-prepared foods an average of five to six times per week. Compared to meals prepared at home, restaurant fare tends to contain more calories, total fat, saturated fat, and sodium. Conventional efforts aimed at addressing the situation described above have focused on encouraging consumers to minimize eating out and/or guiding diners in identifying and selecting healthier menu options, approaches fraught with challenges. Instead, the   default strategy   approach proposed here seeks to test the feasibility of modifying standard restaurant recipes to include less cheese, oil, butter, mayonnaise, salad dressings, etc., to a degree that is not detected and/or is acceptable to restaurant customers. The modifications will result in corresponding reductions in the levels of calories, fat, saturated fat, and sodium. The advantage of the proposed approach is that restaurant consumers will benefit from the modified preparation methods without having to be knowledgeable about nutrition or motivated to make healthier choices. The consumer does not even need to take any specific action to benefit. Instead, this approach relies on the participation and cooperation of restaurants. The appeal of this approach to restaurants includes (1)lower food costs, and (2) the fact that, as menu legislation is requiring more restaurants to reveal nutrient values for their menu items, there is more interest by restaurants to improve the nutrition profiles. Restaurant chefs and RandD teams will workwith HEALTHY DINING, a California-based company with nearly two decades&#039; experience in restaurant nutrition, to revise and then test modified recipes. During Phase I, three  restaurant companies participated in establishing feasibility for the project. Several ingredients tested were successfully reduced by 12 to 25 percent and found to be acceptable to consumers. During Phase II, the research will (1) expand to examine the effect of modifying more restaurant meals from more restaurants, specifically prepared salads, sandwiches, burgers, soups, pasta dishes, and heavily buttered side dishes; (2) investigate ways to improve measurement accuracy when small-to- moderate ingredient modifications are made (3) calculate nutrition improvement achieved by the successful modification as well as cost savings to the restaurants and estimated impact on public health if adopted by the restaurant industry. If this approach is found to be successful, HEALTHY DINING will collaborate with the National Restaurant Association to publicize the effectiveness of the   default strategies   to restaurant chains throughout the nation.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Obesity and poor nutrition contribute significantly to four of the ten leading causes of death in the United States (cancer, heart disease, stroke and diabetes) and cost an estimated  200 billion in health care costs each year. The fact that Americans are eating restaurant-prepared foods four to five times per week, along with the fact that restaurant meals tend to be less healthful and larger than meals prepared at home, contribute significantly to the health problems stated above. Therefore, it is increasingly important for overall public health that restaurants provide and promote healthier meals.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cachexia-anorexia syndrome is a life-threatening aspect to many diseases, in particular many forms of cancer or therapies for cancer. The obvious symptoms of this disease include lack of appetite, and a loss of lean body mass disproportionate to the reduction in caloric intake. However, the less obvious effects include multi-organ failure, due to high metabolic rate-induced apoptosis. The economic costs of cachexia are huge. The National Cancer Institute estimates that up to 40% of cancer deaths are directly due to cachexia, and it is likely a factor in a significant percent of other cancer fataliies. Hyperactivity of the central melanocortin (MC) system appears to be a common factor in most, if not all, forms of cachexia. In addition, recent evidence indicates that the lethargy (lack of activity/movement) associated with cachexia inducing diseases is not MC system mediated, but rather due to suppression to the central orexin system. Thus, the ideal anti-cachectic drug would combine the properties of a MC antagonist and orexin system agonist or stimulator.  Analysis of MCR ligands with in vivo assays, demonstrated the dissociation of MC from cardiovascular (C-V) activity, suggesting a solution to the long-standing problem of MC C-V side-effects Our Phase 1   Proof of Concept   was to produce derivatives of MC peptide antagonists that chronically suppressed C-V activity, while maintaining anti-anorexic activity. Phase 1 of this project was highly successful.  We first made adetailed investigation of MC C-V actions, using arterial pressure, heart rate, and the electrocardiogram. MC ligand C-V activities replicate actions associated with RFamide peptides in different experimental models. The direct cardiac effects modeled the clinical symptoms of   sick sinus syndrome   and   sudden cardiac arrest.   Thus, the endogenous RFamide system may have an etiological role in these human cardiac disorders.  We then designed and synthesized MC cyclic peptide antagonists with an enzymatically stable C-terminal extension. This compound had no C-V activity, lacked the dose-limiting behavioral side-effects associated with other anti-cachectic MC antagonists, produced a 100% reversal of cachexia in an aggressive experimental cancer model, and suppressed cachexia-induced lethargy.  Our Phase 2 Specific Aims are 1) design a MC antagonist peptide to maximize oral absorption and blood brain barrier transport; 2) determine therapeutic index and pharmacokinetics in experimental models, and 3) confirmthe anti-cachexia-anorexia effects in canine malignancies.  Tensive Controls will complete the work necessary to develop anti-cachexia therapeutic, and move it into formal pre-clinical development. This will produce an anti-cachexia drug that will increasethe treatment window for malignancies.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Melanocortins (MCs) are naturally substances that have potential use as therapeutic agents in cachexia, a condition of reduced appetite with enhanced metabolic rate. However, MCs have unacceptable cardiovascular effects. We propose to develop MC drugs with reduced side-effects.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Standard of care for surgical resection of rectal cancer is the performance of low anterior resection (LAR). After removal of the cancerous segment, a surgical stapler is used to restore continuity by creating an anastomosis between the resulting ends of disjointed bowel. Anastomotic leak is one of the most dreaded complications of colorectal surgery due to the morbidity and mortality caused by fecal contamination of the abdominal cavity. Anastomotic leak, after LAR forrectal cancer, has been reported to occur in as many as 14% of patients; three times more frequently than with other bowel resections. The sequela of anastomotic leak can include local abscess formation, debilitating pain, dysfunctional defecation, overwhelming bacterial sepsis, and death. The consequences are so severe that surgeons subjectively opt to divert the fecal stream away from the healing anastomosis to an ostomy; many months later the patient is then subject to an additional operation to restorenormal defecation. While creation of a diverting ostomy can lessen the impact of anastomotic leak, it does not prevent the leak, and poses a high risk for additional complications while significantly compromising the lifestyle of the recovering patient. There is neither a clinically practical method available for predicting which patients will experience an anastomotic leak, nor an objective set of criteria by which a surgeon can select those patients that would benefit from an ostomy. The long term goal ofthe proposed research is to reduce the rate of anastomotic leak and unnecessary ostomy diversion through the creation of an objective, repeatable means by which to screen patients intra-operatively. Patients at low risk will avoid an unnecessary ostomy. Patients at high risk of leak, despite efforts to improve tissue viability, would likely be better served by a permanent ostomy instead of a failed, painful attempt at a restorative procedure. Postulated mechanisms for the increased incidence of leak afterresection of rectal cancer can each contribute to inadequate oxygen delivery to the healing anastomosis; each of which are present at the time of surgery. The Stapled Anastomosis Viability Evaluation (SAVE) System integrates into the surgical workflow by replacing the anvil of commercially available, circular staplers with a sensing anvil. The SAVE Anvil uses an array of multi-modality sensors to enable the surgeon to perform the procedure in a standardized manner while assessing the viability of the anastomosis at the staple line throughout its formation. Sensor data is transmitted to a base station where actionable information is displayed to the surgical team. Phase I demonstrated the feasibility of measuring interstitial oxygenation levels at the anastomotic site using oxygen dependent quenching of phosphorescence via a locally injected phosphor. Initial toxicity studies of the probe indicate non-toxicity at dose-response levels. Phase II of this study will establish the relationship between interstitialoxygen level and integrity of the anastomosis through survival studies in animal models. Concurrently the candidate phosphor with undergo requisite screening, and pharmacokinetic evaluation in preparation for pre-IND discussion.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Colorectal cancer afflicts 1.2 million people annually, the mainstay of treatment being surgical removal of the afflicted segment of bowel. After the surgical procedure the intestine fails to heal in as many as 14% of patients resulting in life threatening illness as fecal material contaminates the abdominal cavity. Surgisense&#039;s Stapled Anastomosis Viability Evaluation (SAVE) System strives to reduce the occurrence of this complication as the first, clinically relevant, intra-operative device capableof providing real-tie assessment of an intestinal tissue&#039;s ability to heal; reducing patient suffering, while saving  2 billion dollars annually in excess healthcare costs.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chemotherapy drugs tend to be highly cytotoxic and genotoxic, with well-documented carcinogenic, mutagenic, and teratogenic effects. Long-term occupational exposure to these highly toxic drugs presents serious health risks (e.g., cancers, infertility, miscarriages, birth defects, spontaneous abortions, and congenital malformations) to over 5.5 million healthcare workers who are exposed to chemotherapy drugs each year. Liquid, particulate, or vapor leakage can occur during any of several steps in the process of compounding the drug and administering it to the patient, and several studies suggest the potential for workplace contamination is widespread. Closed system drug-transfer devices (CSTDs) were originally developed tomitigate these risks, but the devices now on the market suffer from key shortcomings, including leakage, needle sticks, inefficiencies, difficulty of use, and increased risk of repetitive stress injuries and compounding/delivery errors. Corvida&#039;s technology objective is to develop and commercialize a proprietary suite of medical devices that improve the safety of working environments for healthcare professionals and enhance the efficacy of patient treatments. Phase I successfully proved feasibility of theCorvida approach and the potential to overcome the limitations of current devices that leave healthcare workers unprotected. The Phase II goal is to fully validate this new CSTD with extensive testing and optimization. Phase II includes three aims to drivedevelopment of the Corvida CSTD and provide superior protection to healthcare workers. In Aim 1, the CSTD will be validated for design and production quality via published bench-top testing standards, including fluorescein sodium (UV solution) and titanium tetrachloride (visible vapor) tests. These tests will ensure that  the CSTD meets or exceeds all relevant USP and ISO standards to validate that it achieves the intended design and production quality for performance and functionality as well as packagingand sterilization. In Aim 2, the CSTD will be tested to demonstrate that it achieves containment and maintains sterility under end-user process simulation conditions using naproxen sodium and trypticase soy broth. In Aim 3, end-users will use the CorvidaCSTD to conduct compounding and simulated administration tasks (no drugs will be delivered to patients) in multiple pharmacy settings using two well established chemotherapy marker drugs: cyclophosphamide and fluorouracil. The Aim 3 study includes assessment of environmental surface contamination using analytic methods and will provide documentation of any device failures. An independent, certified industrial hygienist will collect and analyze wipe samples from  designated surfaces to assess pre-and-post-CSTD contamination. Iterative design will be utilized as needed to refine the CSTD system to meet all success criteria. As envisioned-and based on the very promising Phase I results-upon completion of Phase II the Corvida CSTD will be the first to meet the NIOSH and USP CSTD definition, and the Corvida device will have been validated against all ISO standards and FDA requirements, culminating in 510(k) market clearance and enabling successful commercialization.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Millions of healthcare workers are at risk of exposure to hazardous drugs, such as chemotherapeutics used to treat cancer patients, during drug preparation and administration. Closed system transfer devices (CSTDs) were originally developed with the goal of protectingworkers from the hazards of exposure to highly toxic drugs, but current devices have several shortcomings. This proposal describes an innovative design and approach for a new type of disposable CSTD that will provide better protection for healthcare workers and cancer patients alike, achieved by limiting the release of these hazardous drugs into the work environment.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Despite notable achievements over the past two decades, cancer remains a challenging 21st century epidemic demanding new, more effective drugs. Nitric oxide (NO) is well known to kill cancer cells without harming normal bone marrow cells, but until now has not been used directly to treat cancer because of its effect to lower blood pressure. JSK Therapeutics (JSKT) has designed a class of diazeniumdiolate prodrugs that release NO upon interaction with glutathione in a reaction catalyzed by glutathione-S-transferase, which is expressed at significantly higher concentrations in cancer compared to normal cells. JSKT has screened a library of these compounds and has identified one, JS-K, as the most active compound of this family. In the Rapid Access to Intervention Development (RAID) program at the NCI, JS-K is active against the entire   NCI 60-cell   screen. JS-K has potent and broad anticancer activity against solid tumors and hematologic malignancies in multiple laboratories but shows no toxicity against normal bone marrow, making it critically important to the future of cancer therapy. In mouse xenograft models of human tumors, JS-K is highly effective against acute myeloid leukemia, prostate cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, multiple myeloma and non-small cell lung cancer. Significant work has begun on this promising therapy and has shown that JS-K is difficult to solubilize and has a short half-life in vivo. Previous NIH funding has allowed a solution for these challenges: a stable nanoscale P123 Pluronic(R) micelle intravenous (IV) formulation for JS-K has been developed, and scale- up production and formulation of 1 kg of JS-K in P123 Pluronic(R) micelles is currently under production in compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices. JSKT submits this Fast Track Phase I/II SBIR application to perform the standard acute and subchronic pre-clinical animal toxicology studies needed using Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) to support a successful Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the FDA. JSKT hypothesizes that P123 Pluronic(R) micelle JS-K will prove non-toxic in therapeutic doses needed to treat cancer in humans. In Phase I, JSKT will accomplish 3 deliverables: 1) perform acute IV toxicology of JS-K in rats; 2) perform bacterial mutagenicity (Ames) testing; and 3) draft the chemistry and manufacturing section for a JS-K IND application. In Phase II, JSKT will accomplish 2 additional deliverables: 1) develop and validate using GLP procedures a sensitive LS/MS/MS assayfor measuring JS-K in biologic fluids; and 2) complete acute IV toxicology studies of JS-K in dogs and 28-day subchronic IV toxicology studies of JS-K in rats and dogs. Upon completion of this project, JSKT will have all the essential pharmacology, toxicology and manufacturing information to submit a successful IND to begin Phase I safety trials of micelle JS-K in humans at the Huntsman Cancer Institute in Salt Lake City, UT. Commercialization of this novel cancer fighting drug, JS-K, will establish a newparadigm in cancer therapy, improve the quality of life for cancer patients and their families with less painful, more effective treatments, and provide a sustainable benefit worldwide.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   This project will continue the development of a highly effective new drug called JS-K, which will treat and kill multiple cancers. JS-K will kill these cancers by a new, more selective and measurably less toxic mechanism, making it entirely relevant to today&#039;s world. This new drug then goes one step further: it will improve the quality of life for cancer patients, their caregivers and families by providing a significantly more effective and less painful therapy than is currently available.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medication nonadherence is a costly healthcare problem, adding  177 billion annually to the nation&#039;s healthcare expenditures. Three out of four Americans do not take their medicine as prescribed, and the ramifications affect virtually every aspect of the health care system. It is called America&#039;s other drug problem for good reason. Nonadherence issues are particularly troublesome with oral chemotherapeutic medications, which are increasingly entering the market, and which often have severe toxicities and narrow therapeutic indices. A review of adherence published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute found that up to 80 percent of cancer patients failed to follow their prescriptions. There is not a   one size fits all   solution to the adherence problem. Thus, this Fast Track application aims to facilitate widespread adoption of promising telemonitoring technology for improving medication adherence by extending it to additional wireless platforms to make it accessible to broad sociodemographic groups. It fosters partnerships among collaborators from academia, healthcare, and industry working together toward this aim. The proposed RandD would enable us to make very promising technology available to more people whocould benefit from it by acknowledging their age, lifestyle, disease state, and preference for a particular communication strategy and platform. The existing technology was developed through a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant from the National Institute on Aging. It integrates cell phones, radio frequency identification (RFID), and health and behavioral informatics to optimize medication compliance, track medication use, and extend patient care to the ambulatory setting. It has consistently demonstrated adherence rates of 96 percent to 98 percent, along with clinically significant improvements in self efficacy, in randomized control studies among elderly chronic disease and cancer patients taking from 1 to 11 medications/day. Usability testingwas conducted by an independent third party at NCI&#039;s User-Centered Informatics Research Lab with outstanding success. Patients reported that the technology makes them feel more confident that they will be able to manage their medications. Clinicians participating in the usability testing gave the clinical interface and Web service high marks, calling it   a great boon for the research nurse or clinical trial coordinator.   We will extend the existing telemonitoring technology, which runs on a cellphone/PDA, to three new platforms: a low-cost smartphone, the Apple iPhone, and an Internet appliance called Chumby. Work will proceed through six stages. In Phase I we will: (1) develop functional prototypes on three new platforms (2) conduct focus groups to evaluate acceptance by patient end-users, and end-user demographics relative to preference for a particular platform. In Phase II we will: (3) develop full functionality on three new platforms based on focus group input (4) integrate and aggregate adherence andpatient reported outcomes data from all platforms through a single web service and user interface (5) conduct a pilot study to demonstrate technical feasibility and assess usability and efficacy (6) assess acceptance of the web service and clinical interface among a sample of clinicians, physicians, providers, and stakeholders in the pharmaceutical supply chain.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pancreatic cancer remains one of the most lethal of cancers, due to a lack of effective early detection methods, complex and invasive surgical treatments, and early spread and metastasis. Clearly, better therapeutic approaches are needed, and in parallel, improved means for detecting and staging pancreatic cancer. Prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA), originally identified as a marker in prostate and bladder cancer, and has also been recognized as highly over expressed in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Antibodies recognizing PSCA have demonstrated biological activity in prostate cancer and are currently in clinical evaluation for treatment of pancreatic cancer. A humanized, affinity-matured anti-PSCA engineered antibody fragment(minibody; single- chain Fv-CH3 fusion protein, 80 kDa) has been generated with rapid tumor targeting and fast blood clearance optimize for imaging applications, including immunoPET. The PSCA-specific minibody has been scaled up and produced under cGMP conditions for a pilot PET imaging study in patients with metastatic prostate cancer. The overall goal of this Fast Track STTR grant proposal is to translate PSCA-specific minibodies for clinical PET imaging of pancreatic cancer. In Phase I, humanized, affinity-matured PSCA minibody will be produced and purified, radioiodination optimized and binding to recombinant PSCA confirmed, and targeting, biodistribution, clearance, and microPET imaging will be evaluated in mice bearing human pancreatic tumor xenografts. In Phase II, starting with an existing Master Cell Bank, a cGMP production run (gt350 mg) of PSCA-specific minibody will be conducted; protein will be purified, vialed and tested. Test radioiodinations withI-124 will be conducted at clinical scale, andan IND application will be prepared. These steps will set the stage for a clinical imaging study in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A kit based PET agent: edotreotide Ga 68 for clinical imaging of somatostatin receptor expressing tissue. Synthetic peptides targeted to Somatostatin receptors (SSTR) were developed almost 30 years ago by Novartis to inhibit the effects of endogenous growth factors on malignant tissues. The radio-therapeutic version has been licensed to Molecular Insight (MIP) and the company is moving forward with phase 3 clinical testing of in somatostatin refractory patients. GMP manufacturing of the API peptide and therapeutic freeze dried kits have been performed by MIP. An approved diagnostic agent, to image SSTR expressing tumors, Indium-111 Octreoscan is already commercial available, although the photon emitting isotope produces low quality images and is not quantitative. Numerous academic centers outside the US have been performing PET imaging with edotreotide Ga-68 and two commercial gallium-68 generators have become available. Clinical studies have demonstrated PET imaging withedotreotide Ga 68 in thyroid disease, neuroendocrine tumors, gastrinomas, carcinoid, meningiomas, prostate cancer, thymoma, non- small cell lung carcinoma and as a potential in vivo monitor of therapeutic drug development and genomic medicine research. Thegoal of this proposal is to make sterile, GMP quality imaging formulation kits of edotreotide available for generation of the PET agent to image somatostatin receptor expressing tissue. Specifically, the GMP campaign for imaging edotreotide kits will be initiated and a physician sponsored safety assessment IND will be conducted for edotreotide Ga-68 (with our collaborators at Mass General Hospital). The Chemistry, manufacturing and controls for the final drug product solution along with a normal human image data base and human safety reports will be generated. Pre-clinical biological comparability studies and preclinical toxicity data on the API and precursor, will be combined with the human phase 1 data and made available to the SNM Clinical trial Networkand be made available to widely dispersed clinical sites as amended INDs for research and efficacy testing. An innovative collaboration between NCI, FDA, CMS, industry and clinicians to accelerate and expand the availability of PET imaging biomarkers wouldhave a significant impact on the fields of medicine research, therapeutic treatment monitoring and new drug development.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A kit based PET agent: edotreotide Ga 68 for clinical imaging of somatostatin receptor expressing tissue. The challenge for diagnostic drugs is their occasional use does not provide a financial incentive to develop new agents. Providing a consistent high quality agent for testing various potential indications at multiple clinical sites s paramount to obtaining innovative new products. We plan to make sterile high quality kits for production of edotreotide Ga 68 to facilitate community access to this investigational molecular imaging biomarker.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is currently no effective treatment for recurrent small-cell lung cancer (rSCLC). The objective of this project is to utilize a monoclonal antibody, Abner, to develop new, rational, and successful treatment of rSCLC. The hypothesis being tested is that an abnormal vasopressin type 2 receptor (AbnV2R) present on these tumors will provide a sensitive, tumor-specific, and reliable target for the effective treatment by Abner antibodies. The data from the studies of Phase 1 of the project clearly show that treatment of variant SCLC tumor xenografts, with native and 90Yttrium-labelled mouse Abner significantly slows growth, but this growth is completely impaired when antibody treatment follows cyclophosphamide. Our data indicate AbnV2R expression is a feature common to all, or most, SCLC and that AbnV2R is a surface protein. Phase 2 is directed at advancing treatment of rSCLC with Abner by developing a human chimeric form (cAbner) of the mouse monoclonal antibody, and thena humanized form (hAbner) as potential clinical candidates. The ability of cAbner and hAbner to target and prevent growth of human variant SCLC xenografts in mice will then be tested. Phase 2 goals are directed towards (i) generating a chimeric form (cAbner) of mouse Abner with the constant regions of human IgG1; (ii) establishing that the targeting, recognition, and treatment profiles of mAbner are retained by cAbner; (iii) modeling a humanized form (hAbner) of Abner from the cAbner with genetically grafting CDRs from the VH and VL regions of mMAG-1 into the DNA framework of a human antibody; (iv) establishing that the targeting, recognition, and treatment profiles of mAbner are retained by hAbner. These investigations will employ, RT-PCR, ligation, and cloning, DNA recombinance, DNA sequencing, immunohistochemistry, antibody modification, Northern and Western analysis with densiometric quantitation, ELISA, RIA, tumor-directed targeting, whole-body scintigraphy for 99mTechnetium, cytofluorographic and radiometric quantitation, confocal microscopy, radioligand binding, flow cytometry, and cell and tumor growth assessments with mechanism analysis in vitro and for nu/nu mice. A successful end-point of our Phase 2 studies would be the generation of cAbner and/orhAbner forms of our antibody that show a similar binding affinity as mAbner, recognize all or most recurrent (and primary) cancers, do not react with normal tissues, and can reduce the size of tumors, and/or prevent their growth in vivo. The proposed research is expected to rapidly lead to new and successful therapeutic approaches for managing recurrent small-cell lung cancer.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will introduce a new targeted therapeutic approach for the treatment of recurrent small-cell lung cancer, a disease that is refractory to all  current treatments. This refractoriness means lt  10% expected 5 year survival rate for patients representing gt 40,000 new cases of SCLC that arise in the USA each year. Our targeted approach is directed at a newly discovered abnormal receptor which seems to be a tumor-specific surface marker of recurrent small-cell lung cancer. Targeting will employ an available monoclonal antibody to treat this deadly disease. This antibody recognizes a unique extracellular portion of the marker. Currently patients with recurrent SCLC usually succumb to the disease in 3 to 6 months. The proposed research is expected to lead to new successful therapies for managing recurrent SCLC, thereby leading to a higher long-term survival rate for these patients.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pain affects over 100 million Americans annually. Opioids are the primary drugs that can treat pain. However, these drugs produce severe and unwanted side effects, such as respiratory depression, nausea, constipation and tolerance development (Berde et al, 2008); in addition, they are highly addictive (Koob et al, 1998). There is clearly a large, unmet need for drugs that can produce analgesia with limited or no side effects.  The peptide neuromedin U (NMU) is believed to be an integral component of pain pathways (Yu et al, 2003). NMU acts through two distinct receptors - the neuromedin U receptor-1 (NMUR1) and 2 (NMUR2) (Brighton et al, 2004). NMUR1 is expressed predominantly in the periphery, with the highest levels inthe gastrointestinal tract (Hedrick et al, 2000), while NMUR2 is mainly expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) (Shan et al, 2000) including regions of the brain implicated in pain (Torres R, 2007). We have shown that NMUR2 knockout mice have reducedpain sensitivity, whereas other physiological activity and responses appear normal. These findings make NMUR2 an attractive drug target and suggest that NMUR2 antagonists may be useful analgesics with potentially limited side effects.  In the Phase I grant we proposed to validate NMUR2 antagonists as novel analgesics. To this end, we a) identified several structurally diverse classes of NMUR2 antagonists through screening of small-molecule chemical libraries and b) demonstrated in vivo efficacy in nociceptive animal models with one of the antagonists that was resynthesized following its identification using the screening library.  With the successful identification of several classes of molecules from the earlier studies, we now propose in this Phase II grant to begin the optimization and preclinical development of validated screening hits. A primary goal will be to synthesize and test compounds in order to produce optimized molecules having CNS drug-like attributes and the desired pharmacological effect. This will be accomplished using a traditional drug medicinal chemistry approach to define structure-activity relationships (SAR) and ultimately construct molecules that have the necessary CNS characteristics.  Our plan is to select screening hits from two diverse chemical classes. Targeted compounds will first be chemically synthesized and then tested for potency in a cell-based assay for NMUR2 antagonism and receptor selectivity. Next, the compounds will be subjected to a battery of in vitro absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) tests and compound profiling assays to optimize compound properties. The most promising compounds will advance to in vivo efficacy and pharmacokinetic testing to provide additional data for further compound optimization. The goal will be to identify multiple candidates that will then be poised for additional preclinical toxicology studies.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project seeks to synthesize, evaluate and advance through preclinical development NMU receptor-2 small-molecule antagonists as a new class of analgesics. 1",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Juvenile crime imposes enormous costs on victims, on society, and on juvenile offenders themselves. However, research assessing the efficacy of interventions for young offenders show, on average, only small effects on recidivism, substance abuse, and other behavioral outcomes. A major problem with existing interventions is that they tend to neglect individual differences in motivation and readiness to make positive changes. In earlier research, we used an empirically validated model of behavior change, the Transtheoretical Model (TTM, the   stage   model), and expert system technology to develop the Rise Above Your Situation program (RAYS), a prototype of a multimedia computerized tailored intervention designed as an adjunct to traditional juvenile justice programs. The intervention delivers assessments and individualized feedback matched to readiness to stay out of trouble with the law and quit alcohol and drugs. At the end each session the program also generates counselor report that summarizes the youth&#039;s feedback and presents concrete, easy-to-implement strategies counselors can use to reinforce stage-matched concepts. In the current research, the goals are to complete development of the computerized tailored intervention; develop training and other support materials for counselors; and assess the efficacy of the intervention package in a randomized clinical trial involving 1,000 court-involved juveniles aged 13-17. Primary outcomes will be criminal recidivism and substance abuse abstinence at 6 and 12 months follow-up.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Following a highly successful Phase I award, this Phase II SBIR application proposes development of MedicaSafe Opioids - a risk management system for the treatment of chronic pain patients prescribed opioid therapies. The need for this system arises from the dramatic increase in the use of opiod painkillers. Although this form of medication can be highly effective in the treatment of pain, it can also be misused, abused, and involve serious risks. Prescription opioids are now the second most abused drugs in the US, and a primary reason prescription drug poisoning has recently become the second-leading cause of unintentional death.  To address this issue, leaders in the field have increasingly called  for the adoption of abalanced   approach to opioid risk management that simultaneously reduces the misuse and abuse of these drugs without limiting their availability to patients with legitimate medical needs. MedicaSafe Opioids is intended to achieve this objective. The solution consists of generic opioid painkillers re-branded via   smart   packaging in a specialized low-cost, tamper-resistant drug dispensing device (DDD) that controls access to prescribed medications via limited-use pass codes, a web/phone portal patientsuse to obtain these pass codes and report on treatment status, and a web-based administrative portal providers use to setup treatment parameters and monitor patient progress. The combined capacities of the system makes it possible for providers to remotely monitor and control patient access to opioid pain killers, while assessing their real-time clinical status and providing education about effective   safe use   practices.  In Phase I, a high fidelity   looks like, works like   physical prototype of te core components of the proposed system was developed and tested. As long as the system performs reliably, results suggest that pain patients view the approach as an acceptable and valuable means of managing the risks associated with the use of opioids, and that pain providers view the system as embodying the principles of an ideal opioid risk management solution.  In Phase II, continued efforts will focus on the production of a full version of the MedicaSafe system that takes into account Phase I findings; completion of a situational study that assesses performance of the Beta version of the MedicaSafe system in a naturalistic clinical environment; completion of a randomized controlled clinical trial that compares the efficacy of MedicaSafe vs. the latest electronic adherence monitoring (EAM) alternative in the delivery of opioid therapies for chronic pain patients over the course of a year; and, finally, completion of an acceptance study that comprehensively evaluates acceptance of the MedicaSafe system from both the patient and provider point of view.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic pain is a serious and undertreated public health problem. However, the increased use of prescription opioids for pain management has been associated with escalating abusethat healthcare providers are ill- equipped to address. This research will develop a risk management approach that involves re-branding generic opioids through the use of   smart   packaging intended to reduce prescription opioid abuse while simultaneously promoting effective pain management.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuropathic pain is a complex, chronic pain state that is usually initiated by tissue injury and maintained, in part, by subsequent dysfunction of damaged peripheral nerve fibers or fibers that innervate that injured tissue. The impact of nerve fiber damage includes a change in nerve function both at the site of injury and areas around the injury. Certain types of peripheral nerve damage cause the development of neuromas with associated localized chronic pain manifestedas allodynia and hyperalgesia. Approximately 30% of these neuromas become sufficiently painful that the affected digit, hand or limb becomes excluded from activities of daily living and the patient is unable to complete routine tasks. Neuroma pain is particularly difficult to treat, and generally responds poorly to current neuropathic pain treatments. The exact pathophysiology of this neuroma pain is poorly understood, though peripheral and central sensitization has been speculated. Calcitonin Gene-RelatedPeptide (CGRP) appears to be critical in this process. CGRP is synthesized by nociceptive sensory neurons of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and released both in the spinal cord where the peptide sensitizes secondary neurons, and from peripheral nerve endings. The effects of CGRP release in the periphery are multifaceted, including induction of vasodilation and macrophage recruitment. Expression of CGRP increases in the DRG neurons of rats after peripheral nerve injury and CGRP accumulates in experimentally-induced neuromas in rats as well as in human neuromas. Furthermore, excessive release of CGRP into the skin of rats was demonstrated in experimentally-induced diabetic neuropathy. These results suggest that increases in CGRP synthesis and release are importantin at least some types of neuropathic pain and may specifically be involved in neuroma pain. The most potent and selective CGRP receptor antagonist, CGRP8-37, is a large peptide and cannot be easily delivered to neurogenic inflammatory sites by common routes. To overcome this problem, we have developed and utilized innovative dissolvable CGRP8-37 microneedle technology and completed a feasibility study of their analgesic potential with SBIR Phase I support (R43 DA026363). In this study, we demonstrated thatmicroneedle delivery of CGRP8-37 or a combination of CGRP8-37 and a Na+ channel blocker to the skin, successfully blocked neurogenic inflammatory pain after ultraviolet B irradiation (UVB) of the skin of rats. In the SBIR Phase II studies proposed here, we  will focus on evaluation of microneedle efficacy in two clinically applicable animal models of neuropathic pain - the spared nerve injury model and the tibial neuroma transposition model. Toward the development of an IND application, we will also investigate the microneedle safety in rabbits which have higher skin sensitivity than rats. The Specific Aims are as follows: 1. Test the efficacy of CGRP8-37 microneedle patches in two rat neuropathic pain models: the Spared Nerve Injury model of regional painand a more localized neuropathic model, the Tibial Neuroma Transposition model. 2. Investigate local dermal toxicity following the transdermal application of microneedles in rats and rabbits, and evaluate toxicity following systemic administration of CGRP8-37 in rats. 3. Examine means of optimizing manufacturing processes of microneedle patches in order to prepare for future IND studies. This Phase II project, if successful, will provide an evidence-based go/no go decision toward IND enabling studies that can lead to first-in-human testing of CGRP8-37 microneedles in volunteers and patients supported by competitive renewal of this Phase II SBIR project.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Neuropathic pain has an annual incidence of almost 1% of the general population Neuropathic pain is frequently regional or localized and frequently follows tissue trauma or nerve injury. Our SBIR Phase I and new preliminary studies demonstrated that cutaneous application of dissolvable microneedles containing a peptide antagonist of the calcitonin gene related peptide receptor is effective in treatment of neurogenic inflammatory and neuropathic pain. In this Phase II study, we aim to further develop this innovative approach as a safe, effective, and convenient therapy for the treatment of regional or localized neuropathic pain.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): While foster-adoptive parents receive some rudimentary training just prior to or in the early months following adoption finalization, many stil harbor unrealistic expectations about adoption and are unaware of the severe behavioral problems they may encounter, no less the role that exposure to substance abuse may play in the child&#039;s development. Our Phase II project will develop and evaluate a comprehensive self-directed online workshop designed to help foster- adoptiveand kinship families better understand how to parent children who were exposed prenatally to parental substance abuse and/or grew up in a home endangered by drug abuse. The training is based on the TIES (Training, Intervention, Education, and Services) program developed at UCLA to help prepare prospective adoptive parents to understand the complex relationship of birth parent drug abuse to children&#039;s subsequent functioning; to develop greater empathy towards and cooperation with birth parents through greater understanding; and to effectively address children&#039;s ongoing emotional and behavioral issues related to parental substance abuse. The workshop consists of viewing highly interactive multimedia material and participating in collaborative workshop exercises that are flexibly scheduled. In addition to the workshop developed in Phase I on Substance-Exposed Infants, we will produce four interlinked training workshops in Phase II: The Child with Substance Exposure and Drug Endangerment, TIES Omnibus Workshop, Special Issues, and Intro to Parenting Approaches. Currently, there is no other comparable resource available for post-permanency (foster-adoptive and kinship) parents that provides proven-effective, interactive multimedia learning via the web. Post- permanency training is also inadequate for kinship parents who are characteristically undertrained and undersupported by the care system. Unfortunately, this is a recipe for the disruption or dissolution of a placement, leading to a lifetime of emotional scars for the child and family. Our approach uses the web as a training resource to deliver innovative training material about children who are substance exposed or drug endangered. The workshops are driven by a custom-designed software engine developed by Northwest Media, Inc. that automates and seamlessly integrates media components, including video, audio, text, interactive exercises, individualized response exercises, and a participant discussion board. Results in Phase I provided support for the effectivenessof the online workshop format. Parents in the treatment group made significantly greater gains from pre- to posttest in knowledge and attitudes towards substance-exposed children than either the comparison or control group; and also greater gains in preparedness, attitudes towards substance-abusing parents, and openness to fostering than the control group. User satisfaction and usability ratings were robust for the treatment group. In Phase II, we will assess changes from pre- to posttest over the entire intervention, as well as 3 months following the posttest. Phase II will assess parent knowledge, attitudes, preparedness, willingness to adopt, and parents&#039; follow-through on adopting.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Subjects participating in this projectwill gain important information about parenting foster-adoptive and kinship children exposed to or endangered by parental substance abuse. The training may help them to better understand and parent children&#039;s behavior problems. As a result, the quality ofparent-child relationships in resource families could improve, which could help stabilize placements and improve children&#039;s short- and long- term mental health outcomes.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Research has shown that parent-targeted interventions are effective in ameliorating conduct disorders, substance abuse, HIV-risk, and related adolescent problem behaviors. During periods of economic turmoil, however, major obstacles such as affordability impede the effective delivery of support services. Ethnic minorities are especially disadvantaged with respect to risk for child behavioral problems, treatment barriers, and access to culturally sensitive interventions.The meteoric rise of Internet  use and recent advance in multimedia technology and software combine to create new opportunities for disseminating evidence-based practices. Parenting Wisely (PW; Gordon, 2000) is a computer-based intervention designed to prevent and treat child disruptive behavior problems. This evidence-based approach fits easily into existing juvenile justice, health, education, and mental health service delivery systems, bypassing many of the current barriers to care. Our Phase I SBIR study focused on revising and enhancing PW with more culturally relevant content and imagery to broaden its appeal to ethnically diverse populations. The findings revealed substantial improvements on virtually all measures of parenting and child behavior and outcomes at 6 months were highly significant and clinically meaningful. This Phase II study is designed to broaden the appeal and potential reach of PW through a formal randomized trial conducted in collaboration with the juvenile justice system (JJS), theprimary market for such a program. Parents of 450 delinquent receiving JJS services as usual (SAU) will be randomly assigned to: PW plus a social networking online discussion forum, PW alone, or SAU. PW is the first online skill-building parent training program to examine effectiveness across different ethnic cultural groups and offers a brief, low cost, accessible approach that could be easily and quickly implemented and sustained in JJS settings. As such, the potential impact for marketing PW and reducingchild behavior problems is considerable. Phase II activities will include the development of a moderated online forum to increase parental social support and skill acquisition. We will also determine the potential marketability of the PW intervention to JJS programs based on the effects of PW on parent report and direct observation measures of parenting behaviors, adolescent behaviors, and family functioning, as well as measures of recidivism and cost savings. User satisfaction, program comprehension, receptivity, and parent self-efficacy will also be assessed.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In the current context of limited resources, demand for services for youth disruptive behaviors such as drug abuse and delinquency, increasing burdens on state budgets, and significant economic turmoil, there is a clear need for identifying and implementing accessible, low cost, effective interventions that can be transported easily into community settings. The evaluation of the newly revised, culturally diverse Parenting Wisely, a web- based interactive parenting skills training program to reduce adolescent problem behaviors, will establish empirical evidence for a highly accessible intervention that can be widely and quickly disseminated with significant public health benefits and reduced societal cost.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The success of drug development and clinical research is heavily dependent on the quality of data, patience compliance, and statistical analysis. Traditional data collection via paper-pencil is labor- intensive and inconvenient, often leading to missing, noisy or invalid entries. There is always a challenge to monitor patients&#039; medication compliance. When conducting analyses, traditional statistical methods lack of flexibility to make faster decisions. Seeing the ubiquitous application of wireless technologies and the quick emergence of Cloud Computing and Bayesian adaptive statistics in the pharmaceutical industry, we propose to develop a system called &#039;portable-devices based Data Solutions over the Cloud&#039; (pDSC) for real-time data collection, scalable data storage, remote patient monitoring, and Bayesian adaptive clinical trial design. pDSC enables faster, cheaper, and effective clinical studies.  Phase I of this project was highly successful. A prototype system was developed and tested by potential users. The business concept was highly acceptable for personalized data collection and analysis using the web-phone architecture. The feasibility of combing body area sensor networks with 3G wireless networks for collecting behavioral, psychosocial, geo-spatial and physiological data was fully verified. The protocols between iPhone and the web applications were developed and the method of high-performance Bayesian computation in the cloud was investigated.  This Phase II proposal aims to fully develop the pDSC system to use smart phones and other portable devices for real-time data collection and patient monitoring. pDSC will be developed over the Windows Azure cloud platform with secure and scalable data storage mechanisms andinterfaces to access other software tools for Bayesian adaptive design and interim analysis. The technical development will enable us to form a contracted research organization (CRO). It will offer cost-effective data services, fully complying with FDA guidelines, to help academic and pharmaceutical industry clients develop medicines to meet the goal of personalized treatment and patient-centered care.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Quality of data and analysis is crucial for the success of any clinical research. The proposed solution based on wireless and Internet technologies and Bayesian adaptive methods will greatly enlarge the capacity and cost-effectiveness of data solutions in developing pharmaceutical products. It has great potential to meet the needs of next generation clinical research and healthcare delivery featured by personalized medicine, patient-centered service, and prevention-oriented care.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tramadol is a widely prescribed analgesic, with over 25 million prescriptions and  565 million in retail sales in 2009, making it among the best selling  generic drugs. One of the advantages of tramadol over traditionalopioids is its lower risk of opioid dependence, resulting in it having an unscheduled status in the U.S. and other countries. Although its mode of action is not completely understood, its analgesic activity is due to synergy between both the parent drug and the desmethyltramadol (M1) metabolite. The production of M1 and its opioid activity is critically dependent on the polymorphic isoenzyme of the debrisoquine-type, cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6). Approximately 10% of Caucasians have a genotype that resultsin reduced activity of CYP2D6. These individuals are poor metabolizers (PM) of tramadol, and their M1 serum concentration is significantly less than normal subjects. Several well controlled clinical trials have shown that the analgesic effect of tramadolis decreased or absent in PM subjects who have low CYP2D6 enzymatic activity. The impact of tramadol resistance in 10% of the U.S. population with low or absent CYP2D6 activity is significant, with upwards of a million patients receiving inadequate analgesia from tramadol therapy annually. Further, the need to switch nonresponders to traditional opioids increases their risk of opioid dependence. Within this need- analysis, there exists an opportunity to develop an   improved tramadol   that would be effective in all patients. Such a product would be expected to be quickly adopted by the market and displace existing tramadol sales. Based on extensive single-dose/steady-state human pilot data gathered in the SBIR Phase I segment, we identified a new proprietary M1/Tramadol tablet (SR105) that we hypothesize will overcome tramadol resistance in PMs by directly supplementing these patients with the M1 metabolite that they are incapable of generating on their own. By providing both the M1 metabolite and the parentdrug, the entire spectrum of opioid and monoaminergic activity will be restored in subjects with the PM phenotype. This SBIR Phase II proposal aims to develop and finalize the required elements to open an IND with the FDA and to conduct a phase 1, two-segment, randomized cross-over clinical trial in 60 subjects that will begin to test our hypothesis.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Tramadol is a widely prescribed analgesic, but 10% of the U.S. population is resistant to Tramadol analgesic effects. This project aims to overcome Tramadol resistance for pain medication by developing a new therapeutic, and corresponding Phase I clinical trial.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): (Phase-2, Renewal) The SACC-Substance Addiction Collaboration Channel(R)   platform is a new   Collaboration, WEB-2.0   springboard specifically designed to structure and share information across the Behavioral/Mental Health Workforce community with the special focus on Substance-Addiction Disorders. SACC is an individual and group-level application platform that is akin to Facebook and other social networking applications. The foremost goal of SACC is to stem the   information delivery crisis   that now faces this clinical Workforce and to stem the tide of fragmentation across the service delivery sector. This crisis is significantly hindering the delivery of key diagnostic and treatment service to a population that is spread across our national landscape: the Urban-to-Suburban-to-Rural-to-Frontier setting. The SACC platform is a new WEB-2.0 collaboration platform that is built upon the most recent engineering software systems. It focuses on learning, sharing and structuring behavioral/mental health best practices. Members from professional associations and focus action teams strategically located in multiple states have helped in the pre-planning analysis and design of the SACC platform. MRI image sets have been translated into 3D- and 4D-image sequences that show both healthy and non-healthy brains. The brain models then are hyperlinked to new research findings that, together, form a unique Visual Knowledge Base that the addiction community can quickly access, share, addto, and discuss. New User Interface utilities are built into SACC including access portals to the Visual Knowledge Base, a new generation of interactive e-Learning modules that heretofore have not been available, and content from the NIDA-TOOLKIT. For thefirst time, the SACC platform provides new collaboration channels that inter-link researchers, clinicians, families, communities and individuals. It is believed the evaluation process will show the efficacy of SACC as a significant,  long-term benefit forchanging service delivery. Thus, SACC will become a primary force in finally establishing a valid credentialing/ licensing process that has been sought after for so long. The SACC team consists of experts from psychiatry, neurology, nursing, addiction counseling, social work, occupational therapy, clinical anatomy, computer engineering, medical visualization, instructional technology and a milieu of community volunteers spread across Rural America.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This 24-month, Phase-2 SBIR project is called: SACC--[the] Substance Abuse Collaboration Channel(R)  . For the first time, the SACC platform unifies the clinical and services intervention communities by providing a newly focused WEB-2.0 design that integrates enabling technologiesspecifically designed for collaborative communications. The SACC platform focuses on knowledge discovery, brain modeling linked to behavioral health, clinical support, and peer-to-peer information sharing-all elements that form the springboard needed to improve our national and global public behavioral/mental healthcare delivery systems. For the first time, delivery of Evidenced-based Services developed for community settings in Rural and Frontier regions will be possible. These communities always have been hampered by the   Lack of State-of-Art Information   desperately needed of clinical interventions, for the information resources needed to improve organizational structures and activities that make effective implementation of key interventions possible.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Changes in speech articulation can accompany many biomedical disorders and conditions that affect neurological control of speech. Historically, measuring these changes by acoustic analysis has required either laborioushand measurement or computer programming skill. As part of the output of previous work, we have developed fast automatic computer procedures based on acoustic landmarks for a number of specific studies. These procedures considerably streamline the processof acquiring and analyzing speech production data. In multiple collaborations we have found that the method we have developed to produce these procedures yields significant and useful results in widely separated areas of neurological interest. However, development of these procedures has thus far proceeded in response to the particular needs of individual projects and has not systematically addressed the needs of outside users.  In response to PA 08-114, we will expand our library of procedures into a convenient software tool, SpeechMark, for wider use by scientists with or without a background in speech research. SpeechMark&#039;s modules will be presented as a menu of specific measures and will be provided in the form of plug-ins (  ports  ) to existing analysis software tools  such as WaveSurfer, the R statistical-analysis system, MATLAB, and Excel. They will offer summary statistics for the measures as well as for additional composite measures that we have found to be reliable indicators of the existence of speech differences between populations or conditions. Further, SpeechMark will be set up to report data from a single audio file, or groups of audio files in a standard table format, for easy input to statistical or other analysis software We plan to developan organized methodology in, a common Software Development Kit (SDK) as a foundation for every SpeechMark port. This will enable us to maintain existing ports and develop new ones in response to the changing needs of the user community. As envisioned by PA 08-114, the availability of such tools will   jump-start   the use of speech production analysis across a wide range of neurologically important areas of research.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Changes in health status and speaking condition often affect the articulation of speech. Scientific investigation of these changes has been handicapped by lack of access to robust, user-friendly software tools for fast, automatic measurement of speech acoustics. The software development is aimed at making acoustic landmark-detection software, which is focused on articulation, available to a wider community of scientists in the form of add-ons to existing analysis software tools such as WaveSurfer, MATLAB, and Excel.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this project is to develop and field-test prototype software for a research-based vocabulary development program featuring a combined lexical-cognitive approach to noun acquisition. The target population for the curriculum will be 3-8 year old children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), as well as a broad range of other children with language disorders, with language function in the range of 2-5 years. The curriculum will use a core noun vocabulary intraining activities de- signed to address four interrelated goals: (a) train a basic noun vocabulary using both fast and slow mapping strategies; (b) enrich the semantic features of lexical entries by associating them with functional and/or descriptive information; (c) enhance lexical organization by using the core vocabulary in a series of categorization activities; and (d) expand paradigmatic schemas with training that associates basic level nouns with paradigmatically associated concepts. A subset of the curriculum was developed in Phase I and used in iterative testing with subjects in the target populations. It was found that even low language functioning children with ASD were able to use the prototype materials as intended and acquire or demonstrate knowledge of fast mapping, the vocabulary items, their categories, and their semantic associations. In Phase II the knowledge gained in Phase I will be used to improve and expand the curriculum into a prototype that covers 220 Target Nouns (110 associated pairs) with at least 10 superordinate noun categories. The prototype will include a unique integrated expert curriculum control system that includes probe tests to establish appropriate entry points into the curriculum, and will provide highly individualized and efficient language instruction in appropriate activities with proper instructional support. The prototype will be used in a 12-week field test in a public school distrit to evaluate its effectiveness when used by children with ASD and language impairments under natural conditions. Dependent measures will include pre- and post-intervention measures of receptive and expressive language status.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Impaired language is recognized as one of the hallmarks of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Despite extensive incidental exposure to language, many children with ASD have a markedly limited vocabulary and are clearly in need of formal remediation. The goal of this project is to develop a curriculum and prototype software for a research-based vocabulary development program featuring a combined lexical-cognitive approach to noun acquisition. The curriculum will focus on helping children to develop the learning processes necessary for efficient lexical acquisition and organization, andon laying the groundwork for a rich and semantically well organized conceptual framework. This will provide a cost effective means to promote early language and cognitive development in children with ASD as well as a broad range of other children with language disorders.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD) supports research and development of innovative technologies for improving the quality and use of hearing aid devices. Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes the development of a new Ear Canal Optical Coherent Tomography (ECOCT) system to obtain the shape of the individual ear canal and the corresponding 3D image of the underlying tissue by a purely optical means, without taking an ear canalimprint. This innovative system will improve the accuracy of ear canal shape measurements (to better than 10  m) and provide a unique opportunity to use a 3D map of the underlying tissue to help eliminate excess pressure from the hearing aid shell impinging on the most sensitive areas in the ear canal. The digital file obtained by the ECOCT system will be sent to the hearing aid manufacturer through the Internet, and will be easily archived or stored on a personal memory stick. Manufacturing cost savings will be achieved through reduction of the shell rework to obtain a perfect fit into the ear canal. In Phase I, POC demonstrated the feasibility of the ECOCT concept by assembling a proof-of-concept prototype and demonstrating its performance with phantom ear models. The capabilities of the ECOCT system to measure the three-dimensional shapes and obtain mapping of the underlying tissue provides a strong foundation for the development of the Phase II prototype. The demonstration of the technologies in the course of Phase I show the feasibility of the successful development of a commercially viable system in the course of Phase II. In Phase II, POC will develop a fully operational device for digital mapping of the ear canal shape. The prototype will be tested with ear models at POC and then the operation of the prototype will be demonstrated with human subjects at the House Research Institute, Los Angeles, California. The performance of the ECOCT Phase II prototype will be evaluated against conventional ear canalimpression techniques. Software will be developed for conversion of the ECOCT data into standard formats for custom hearing device manufacturing. The commercial viability of the ECOCT system will be evaluated in the course of Phase II and work will be initiated with potential partners for commercialization of the system. The fully developed ECOCT will provide a new rapid and more precise way of measuring ear canal shapes for custom fabrication of hearing aid devices. ECOCT technology will also be used forfabrication of individual noise protection devices for a wide variety of professionals (operators of heavy machinery, musicians, airport personnel, the military, etc.). Making individually fitted hearing protection devices will facilitate their acceptanceby personnel while reducing cost, and will encourage employers to enforce their use by employees. As a result, less hearing loss effects will occur among American workers, which will have a significant impact on their quality of life.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Approximately 36 million American adults report some degree of hearing loss and would benefit from hearing aid use. However, only ~20% of potential hearing aid candidates actually use these devices because of issues such as inconvenience, discomfort, stigma, cosmetics, sound quality, and affordability. The conventional method of designing individual hearing aid shells involves taking imprints of the ear canal using various types of impression materials, and sending the imprints to a hearing aidmanufacturer, where the imprint shape is measured by a 3D laser scanner for subsequent computer-assisted shell design. The imprint-making step is the major source of mistakes and the need for rework in hearing aid manufacturing, causing significant cost increases for hearing aid devices and disappointment with the sound quality, as well as discomfort for patients. The Ear Canal Optical Coherent Tomography (ECOCT) system will provide digital 3D imaging of the shape of individual ear canals by a purely optical means, with better accuracy, while enabling mapping of the underlying tissue to improve shell fit into the ear canal. The digital file of the ear canal shpe and the map of the underlying tissue obtained at the primary care provider&#039;s office will be easily sent to the shell manufacturer, and archived or stored on a personal memory stick. The ECOCT technology will reduce the hearing aid cost (by decreasing the rework to get a better fit) and improve the sound quality, convenience, and comfort of hearing aid use.",

The smartphone multi-microphone audiovisual array accessory will be in a form factor thatallows attachment to the back of the smartphone. The accessory will also contain a lower power radio by which it can transmit audio signals to compatible hearing aids. The smartphone software application will use the smartphone&#039;s built in camera to acquireimages and perform real-time face detection using the built-in face detection support of the smartphone.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Twenty-six percent of the population twenty years and over have destructive periodontal disease (gt 4 mm loss of bone height). Alveolar bone height correlates well with subsequent tooth loss. Moreover, it has been foundthat periodontal disease correlates with other diseases, e.g., atherosclerosis and diabetes. Proper diagnosis, treatment, maintenance, and patient education result in the reduced effects of periodontal disease and ultimately improve the quality of life ofthe patient. Yet for the vast majority of the  U.S. and world population, clinical assessment of periodontal status is subjective and performed by qualitative means, i.e., visual inspection and by using periodontal probes, with little focus on  patient education. In Phase 1, Imagination Software Corporation (ISC) developed a reliable, sensitive, easy to use, and rapid system for measuring alveolar bone height and its change consisting of (a) a user-friendly interface for manual indication of the cemento-enamel junctions (CEJ) and crest-tooth junctions of a tooth, (b) image analysis techniques to improve the accuracy of the indications, removing the onus of careful indication, and calculate the bone height along the distal and mesial edges of a tooth, and (c) methods to determine bone height change. In Phase 2, a prototype system will be developed that will perform a fully automated full-mouth (64 sites) crest height analysis in less than one minute per patient. The system uses digital/digitized radiographs acquired as part of standard dental care are required, i.e. no additional radiation dose to the patient, is based on the technology developed in Phase 1 (for a single site), and requires user interaction after image input. This will be achieved by couplingth Phase 1 technology with automated identification of the teeth and their numbers. This system will be evaluated in experimental and clinical settings, using feedback from dentists to make enhancements and improve the ease of use and clinical utility of the software. Working with the end users of the product in its development will ensure that it will enhance the clinical practice without affecting clinical workflow, eventually becoming an essential part of their practice. The final product will allow a simple, rapid, precise, and accurate assessment of the periodontal bone status of all teeth using radiographic images, resulting in a new first line of defense in the  diagnosis of destructive periodontal disease. The system will give all dentists the ability to detet and treat the disease at an earlier stage and allow them to better monitor maintenance patients receiving treatment for the disease. When incorporated into existing image viewing software that dentists use and are already familiar with, ISC&#039;s system will be adapted easily into practice and achieve a strong market penetration, which (coupled with accurate, precise, and reliable data) means improved dental care for millions of patients.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Alveolar bone height correlates well with subsequent tooth loss. The goal of this proposal is the development and implementation of an automated, reliable, sensitive, easy to use, and rapid product for the measurement of alveolar bone height and its change for every tooth in every patient. When used routinely in dental practice, this system will result in a new first line of defense in the diagnosis of destructive periodontal disease, thus giving the dentist the ability to detect and treat the disease at an earlier stage and improvethei ability to monitor maintenance in patients receiving treatment.",

When dental caries breaks down enamel and involves the dentin, the patient experiences pain and thermal sensitivity. The acute phase of dental pulp infection is typically associated with excruciating pain, and if not properly managed, can lead to peri-apical infection, tooth loss, facial infection and even systemic infections such as endocardiomyotis. Currentdental treatments for tooth decay rely on surgical removal of decayed enamel and dentin by dental instruments and filling of the prepared cavity with artificial materials including amalgam and composite resin. However, current restorative dental treatmentsby artificial fillers have finite service life and can fail unpredictably. Tooth fracture and secondary infections are among some of the well documented complications of current dental and endodontic treatments. Treatment options are further limited for deciduous teeth and young permanent teeth. We have discovered that dentin-like tissues can regenerate by bioactive scaffold formulations in our SBIR Phase I related work. The overall goal of this SBIR/Phase-2 proposal is to identify and prepare efficaciousand safe bioactive scaffold formulations for the regeneration of dentin-like tissues. This SBIR-Phase 2 represents essential intermediate funding to advance our technologies to the next stage of commercialization and eventually into a product that can ultimately regenerate dentin in patients who suffer from dental pain, trauma and infections.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dental caries (tooth decay), is the single most common chronic disease of childhood, affecting nearly 6 in 10 children in the United States. Poor oral health is epidemic among all children, but is especially severe among lower income children. Untreated, tooth decay has severe consequences to society and to the individual, resulting in pain that can interfere with school attendance, learning, and play. Poor oral health often continues into adulthood, and research shows linkages between poor oral health and heart and lung disease, diabetes, stroke, pre-term low birth weight. Community oral health programs (COHPs) are a key strategy for reducing oral health disparities, primarily through disease prevention, increasing access to care and policy development. Unfortunately these programs cannot readily quantify the results of their activities and researchers lack data to publish evidence-based solutions to influence practitioners and policymakers. Many also lack the ability tobill insurance for services. The Phase 1 identified the information that dental publc health practitioners and researchers need to improve programs and policies for reducing the high rate of dental decay in low income children and the requirements to allowCOHPs to bill for services. It determined the merit and feasibility of developing a solution for these groups based on an existing, prototype software toolkit and database, the Healthy Teeth Toolkit Version 1 (HTT1) from Oral Health Solutions (OHS), currently used by a limited number of representative COHPs. In Phase 1 OHS specifically determined 1) the current information tools and data collection needs of a broad range of COHPs, including needs related to billing and program evaluation and 2) the tools and data collection needs of researchers, policy experts and funders. Phase 1 further established the feasibility of developing a commercial version of the HTT1, the HTT2, that meets these identified needs and it developed a detailed systems specification for this system. Phase 2 proposes to build the commercial version of the Healthy Teeth Toolkit, HTT2, using the detailed systems specification developed in Phase 1. The resulting software system will be deployed and thoroughly tested in several representative COHPs to insure it efficiently meets the needs of COHPs and researchers and is of suitable, robust commercial quality.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Surgeon General&#039;s Report on Oral Health stated that   The public health infrastructure for oralhealth is insufficient to address the needs of disadvantaged groups.   Community-based oral health programs (COHPs) are the primary strategy for expanding capacity to serve these vulnerable populations. The HTT2 e-tool kit is intended to enhance the quality of services of COHPs and to provide relevant data demonstrating changes in oral health status.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Quick-Set Material- Phase II Quick-Set material is proposed for vital pulp therapy and for non-vital endodontic use to make the clinical procedures shorter and more consistent, of benefit to the patient and clinician,and enhance the probability for a positive outcome. The new material should promote regeneration of the periodontal ligament and cemental tissues that are injured by endodontic infections or removed during endodontic procedures. Such regeneration of tissues enhances the biological seal of the root canal system to reduce the possibility of re-infection, and enhance tooth retention without further  treatment, surgery, or extraction. The material is intended to be an improvement on the present standard of care, MTA material which suffers from clinical deficiencies of long setting times (hours), difficulty in placement and retention, lower than desired radiopacity, and inability to se under acid conditions. In Phase 1, Quick-Set was shown to set in about 10 minutes (not hours) and was demonstrated to have superior sealing (including penetration of dentinal tubules), higher radiopacity, and better resistance to acids present in infections. The Quick-Set material was shown to have an alkaline pH, release calcium ions, form hydroxyapatite in synthetic body fluids, and meet ADA 57 requirements as they apply. This Phase 2 project is to test the Quick-Set Material from Phase 1 for its biocompatibility and in vivo performance. This testing planned is to examine the biocompatibility using odontoblast-like cell cultures, and then expand the testing to performance in vivo with canines and rats. The canine study will compare Quick-Set to White MTA material in both vital and non-vital pulp indications. Calcified and decalcified histology will be augmented by measurement of bone regeneration determined by  CT. The rat study will compare the healing performance of pulp infections between the two materials, using orofacial pain measurements (meal duration measurement) and ELIZA histology for markers of inflammation. The clinical handling and filling of roots and vital pulp treatments will be examined  by the clinicians performing the animal studies, to ensure the material can meet clinical expectations. In parallel, a sealer formula (denoted herein as Quick-Set Sealer) will be developed in the laboratory. The sealer should have the same good qualities of Quick-Set, but should contain finer particles, meet all the requirements of ISO 6876 and ADA 57, and have a longer setting time, with handling similar to conventional root canal sealers. The Quick-Set sealer will be used in a second canine study with decalcified histology. Laboratory testing will also be performed to increase the strength measurements of Quick-Set and develop paste-based formulas.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Quick-Set Material, Phase II Quick-Set material is being developed to enable dentists treating the infected pulp of teeth or their roots to complete the procedures more quickly and with better results. Manyuses are planned for Quick-Set material to heal infected pulps and root infections, with the goal of retaining teeth and reducing the need for other procedures such as extraction or implants. The Quick-Set material is designed to be quicker-setting, evenwhen an infection is present, and to seal and heal teeth better than existing materials.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Dental caries is one of the most prevalent diseases in the U.S. with 85% of adults and the majority of children having been treated for at least one incidence. While this disease impacts all individuals, it is especially an issue for those of low economic status who have limited access to professional oral care. Dental caries is attributed to the presence of the acidogenic bacterium Streptococcus mutans within biofilms, or plaque, on oral surfaces. Biofilms are surface-attached communities of bacteria that are surrounded by a protective matrix. Bacteria in biofilms are upwards of 1000 times more resistant to currently used antimicrobials than free-floating bacteria. As such, antimicrobials used in oral rinses do not  effectively eliminate biofilms; therefore, plaque continues to accumulate, resulting in dental caries. Based on the prevalence and economic disparity of the disease, an affordable, over-the-counter (OTC), widely-distributed solution to plaque removal is needed.  In Phase I, Agile Sciences identified five lead anti-biofilm molecules that are effective at dispersing oral biofilms  that cause dental caries. These   Agilyte     molecules are derived from a natural product that controls biofouling of a marine organism. The lead compounds are able to selectively inhibit and disperse biofilms of S. mutans, while not affecting commensal Streptococcal species, S. gordonii and S. sanguinis. Compound efficacy was demonstrated under growth conditions that mimic saliva flowwithin the oral environment. The lead compounds are non-cidal to bacteria and not cytotoxic to eukaryotic cells at active concentrations. The compounds are also able to disperse multi-species biofilms formed by human saliva on a tooth-like surface. Treatments of saliva-derived biofilms with current OTC oral rinses revealed that the AgilyteTM compounds are able to increase the efficacy of the active ingredients by gt2-fold, and this enhancement of oral rinse activity is seven times greater under flow conditions that are more representative of the oral environment. In this Phase II project, we will use in vitro and in vivo analyses to further develop these lead compounds as anti-biofilm additives for OTC oral rinses. In Aim 1, toxicity profiles of the lead compounds will be determined. In Aim 2, an in vivo model of oral colonization will be used to determine if the biofilm reduction capabilities seen in vitro translat to the ability to decrease plaque load in vivo within formulation. A single lead compound identified in Aim 2 will be evaluated in Aim 3 for stability within formulation and will undergo synthetic optimization for large- scale production. The major milestone to be achieved in this Phase II project will be identification of a lead molecule that isnon-toxic, active in vivo, and cn be synthesized on a large scale for commercial production. In Phase III, the formulated Agilyte   oral rinse will undergo additional preclinical and clinical testing that will facilitate commercialization of an OTC oral rinse product that is highly effective at removing pathogenic biofilms from teeth. This product has the potential to improve personal oral healthcare, thereby decreasing the incidence of dental caries, particularly for those of low economic status that are most affected by the disease.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The incidence of dental caries is staggering with occurrence of the disease being second only to the common cold. Dental caries are caused by pathogenic bacteria within plaque, a mixed community of bacteria known as a biofilm that is difficult to remove from tooth and oral tissue surfaces. This project involves incorporating potent anti-biofilm molecules into oral rinses to effectively remove and kill bacteria within plaque so that th incidenceof dental caries will be reduced.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dental implants have very high survival rates and are the fastest growing field in dentistry. But, high complication rates result in significant morbidit, cost, and disappointment. Better pre-operative knowledge of softtissue thickness and hard tissue contour could dramatically cut complication rates. Current soft tissue thickness measurement techniques for implant procedures involve somewhat inaccurate mechanical penetration of delicate tissues with probes or radiography which is not optimal for soft tissue measurement. A noninvasive ultrasound imaging system is proposed that can potentially improve implant procedures by enabling: accurate non-invasive preoperative measurement of soft tissue thickness, including grafts;identification of important surface bony features such as foramina; identification of bony defects or dehiscences on teeth before extraction, or implants after placement; facilitate intra-operative redirection of the initial drill should a cortical bonyperforation occur; and precise location of buried healing implants with measurement of overlying soft tissue. Ultrasound is ideally suited to this purpose because: it can be used in real-time before or during surgeries; data is located to the exact site being imaged on the patient, as directly viewed by the dentist; it is non-invasive and without ionizing radiation; and it can be performed with an inexpensive portable instrument.  If successful, the ultrasound system is expected to lower the overall societal cost of implant therapy by decreasing the need for expensive adjunctive procedures necessitated by surgical, esthetic and prosthetic complications. Additionally, the system will improve the quality and predictability of routine implant outcomes (especially facilitating minimally invasive flapless surgery) - important to both dentists and patients.  The objective of this Phase II SBIR effort is to demonstrate the clinical efficacy of a customized noninvasive ultrasound imaging system, ImSight, for dental implant procedures. The proposal will focus on fabrication of customized ImSight probes, in-vitro learning studies, in-vitro optimization studies of probe embodiments, clinical trials, and regulatory testing of the ImSight device. The system will be used for treatment planning prior to surgical placement of dental implants, during surgical implant placement, during their subsequent surgical uncovery, and for long-term monitoring.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Dental implants have very high survival ratesand are the fastest growing field in dentistry, but are currently beset by high complication rates resulting in  the need for a great many adjunctive procedures and less than optimal functional and esthetic outcomes. A noninvasive ultrasound imaging system has the potential to improve site assessment, treatment planning, surgical procedure, uncovery, and monitoring, by enabling accurate identification and measurement of soft tissue thicknesses, bony defects, tooth and implant dehiscences, mental and otherforamina, jawbone form, and the precise location of buried healing implants. If successful, the inexpensive system is expected to lower the overall societal cost of implant therapy, facilitate minimally invasive flapless surgery, and improve the quality and predictability of routine implant outcomes - important to both dentists and patients.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bone loss due to fractures and disease is a serious medical condition in the US affecting millions of Americans. It is particularly a problem with oral  craniofacial disorders were the costs of treating damage exceeds60 billion annually. Furthermore, periodontitis is associated with systemic disorders such as diabetes mellitus, preterm low birth weight, and cardiovascular disease. While major efforts have been made to understand mechanisms of healing of large bones andto develop therapeutics to treat overall bone loss, very little information is available on bone remodeling in the human craniofacial skeleton, nor the mechanisms involved in osteonecrosis of the jaw and there are few effective treatments. The results ofour phase 1 SBIR showed that a unique population of human, adult, pluripotent, Very Small Embryonic like (VSEL) stem cells, have important bone regenerative properties and could be useful in treating oral-craniofacial disorders. Human VSELs are pluripotentstem cells involved in the normal turnover and regeneration of tissues and their circulating levels greatly increase in response to injury. They are able to repair injured tissues such as the heart after myocardial infarct. Adult human VSELs, are SSEA-4+/Oct-4+/CD133+/CXCR4+/Lin-/CD45-, express pluripotency markers (Oct-4 and Nanog) and are capable of differentiation into cells from all three germ lineages. With our collaborator, Dr. Russell Taichman of the University of Michigan we showed that VSELs differentiate to osteoblastic lineage after intra-marrow transplant. Importantly, VSELs from adult humans repaired a calvarial defect in SCID mice. The human VSELs formed new bone when applied in the injured area as measured by u-CT scan, and histological analysis demonstrated osteogeneis, significant new bone formation, dense thickening of the trabeculae and bone marrow formation. Most importantly, new bone tissue was derived from the human VSELs. These studies show that VSELs can generate new bone and have thepotential to repair bone injuries. In this phase 2 SBIR, we propose to further test the effectiveness of human VSELs to regenerate bone in human patients. Specifically, we will test the ability of VSELs to promote bone remodeling in the human craniofacialskeleton. For our studies, we will test the efficacy of human VSELs to generate bone in humans in a tooth extraction model in which individuals requiring tooth extraction due to caries or periodontal disease will be the subjects. In these individuals, theunderlying jaw bone tissue is injured and depleted and while there is some healing overtime after tooth extraction, the process is slow. We will test whether VSELs isolated from the patient expedite bone growth in the oral cavity after tooth removal. TheVSELs are autologous and will not cause rejection and do not form tumors or cause other health risks. This is not a clinical trial but a focused patient based study intended to move forward the development of VSELs as a therapeutic for bone repair. It successful, these studies will provide the basis for the rapid clinical development of VSELs for craniofacial osseous regeneration and treatment of a number of other skeletal based disorders.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  It is a goal of NeoStem to develop the therapeutic capabilities of Human VSELs to treat a host of diseases and disorders. Studies in this proposal are focused on establishing the utility of VSELs to repair bone and treat oral-craniofacial disorders. If the results of these studies in humans show safety and efficacy of adult autologous VSELs in bone repair, then we will attempt to further develop this cell therapy in clinical studies in the futureto establish the cells as a standard of care for the treatment of bone disease and loss.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this Phase II project is to advance the development of novel tolerance-inducing peptides (Tregitopes) to prevent and/or treat Type 1 diabetes (T1D) by optimizing the clinical delivery vehicle and treatment protocol, and by identifying correlates of efficacy in preparation for Phase 1 clinical trials. More than 13,000 children in the U.S. are diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) each year. T1D results from destruction of insulin-producing pancreatic islet cells by auto-reactive T cells, eventually leading to glucose intolerance. Induction of antigen (Ag)-specific tolerance is the key to effective immunotherapy for T1D. EpiVax discovered a new biologic intervention for T1D called Tregitopes, which are administered along with insulin peptides in order to reprogram the autoimmune responses and induce islet cell Ag-specific tolerance. On the basis of excellent Phase I results, and parallel collaborative studies demonstrating the induction of Ag- specific tolerance in gene therapy and transplant models, this Phase II project will advance a form of Tregitope therapy called T1D-Ag-Specific Adaptive Tolerance Induction (T1D-ASATI) toward preclinical development. Successful translation of T1D-ASATI to the clinic will havea radical impact on the field of diabetes therapy, potentially abrogating the need for insulin therapy in T1D. Studies in Phase I of this project demonstrated that Tregitopes can both prevent and successfully treat diabetes in NOD mice, when delivered prior to, or at the onset of diabetes, however, the delivery vehicles tested in Phase I are not FDA-approvable.     The primary objective of this Phase II project is, therefore, to select a clinically feasible delivery vehicle and regimen; the secondary objective is to define biomarkers or correlates of Tregitope efficacy to support clinical development. Aim 1 will identify a suitable delivery vehicle therapeutic administration route, administration frequency protocol, and dose range for Tregitope therapy in the genetically susceptible non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse model of T1D. Delivery of either peptides or concatamers composed of the Tregitope and PPI epitopes will be tested in clinically proven vehicles: liposomes, glucan particles, and as a conjugate withrecombinant human albumin. Pharmacokinetic and toxicity testing of the final formulation have been included in this revised application, per the review. Aim 2 is devoted to defining key correlates of efficacy associated with the induction of tolerance byTregitopes in NOD mice, and adaptive tolerance induction in NOD GFP and DO11.10 FoxP3:knock-in mice. Induction of Ag-specific aTregs is an innovative feature of this approach.     The long-term goal of this research program is to develop, define, validateand commercialize a novel, first-in-class, safe and effective biological therapy to prevent or treat T1D. We have secured the enthusiastic participation of a regulatory expert (Cavagnaro) and two experienced drug developers (CardioVax, Novozyme) that willsupport our program.  Upon successful completion of the Phase II project, we will be well equipped to enter into pre-INDA discussions with the FDA in preparation for T1D-ASATI Phase I clinical trials.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Preserving islet cell function is believed to be a cure for Type 1 Diabetes. EpiVax is developing a novel approach to diabetes based on Tregitopes, small peptides derived from the natural plasma protein, immunoglobulin. Tregitopes prevent or reduce autoimmune destruction of cellsin the pancreas that produce insulin. Successful development of Tregitope therapy would have a radical impact on the field of diabetes therapy and could eliminate the need for insulin therapy in T1D.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An estimated 23.6 million people (7 percent of the population) in the United States have diabetes; 90 to 95 percent of all diagnosed cases are type 2 diabetes (CDC, 2007). Obesity and metabolic syndrome are the leadingcauses of type 2 diabetes. The search for new and more effective therapies to address the growing number of Americans with type 2 diabetes and related conditions is currently hindered by the lack of a research animal model that closely resembles the conditions such as obesity and metabolic syndrome that lead to the human type 2 diabetic condition. Most rodent models currently available commercially that have obesity, metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes, have genetic defects in leptin-receptors, leptin orin other hypothalamic peptides. These mono-genetic defects are not common causes for the etiology of obesity and diabetes in the human population. A new mouse model without these defects would more closely resemble the continuum of metabolic disorders that is beginning to be recognized between these human conditions. Thus, a more appropriate model for obesity, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes and the consequent complications is needed for this work. In 2004, PreClinOmics (PCO) began a promising programto develop a new mouse model without leptin/leptin- receptor and other genetic defects which would affect hypothalamic function, by crossing two inbred mouse models with the propensity to develop diet induced obesity with insulin resistance. The long-termgoal of this project is to create a mouse model that will be accepted by the biotech or pharmaceutical industries, and the research community to advance the study of and the development of therapies for obesity, metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes in humans. Phase II of the project will focus on the continued development, defining, and characterization of this new obese mouse model. The project has four specific aims: 1) Continue development of the Fatzo mouse to achieve genetic and phenotypic homogeneity of traits for obesity and metabolic syndrome. Confirm normal function of LepR and Lep genes by experimental evidence of responsiveness to exogenous leptin. 2) Identify and confirm the presence of known components of human metabolic syndrome/type 2 diabetes in the Fatzo mouse. Components to be examined include reduced energy expenditure, dyslipidemia, hypertension, dysfunctional glucocorticoid regulation, low grade inflammation, beta cell dysfunction and activated renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS). 3) Confirm the models&#039; responsiveness in prevention and treatment strategies to agents marketed for the clinical treatment of metabolic syndrome/type 2 diabetes. 4) Confirm the model&#039;s responsiveness to dietary manipulation to maintain the pre-diabeticstate as well as to accelerate the progression to frank diabetes.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Research to identify new treatments for human obesity and its related conditions is hindered by the lack of relevant animal models. This effort will describe a new mouse model that reflects the human disease and is therefore applicable for the evaluation of potential treatments.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Type I diabetes is a widespread disease in which insulin producing pancreatic islets are lost, leading to unstable glucose levels. If the islets can  be replaced, as with transplantation, then diabetes can be reversed.Human islets have limited utility because of a severe shortage of donors and the need for constant immune suppression to prevent rejection. Pigs could provide an unlimited supply of islets but the rejection would be even more vigorous, necessitating greater immune suppression.     Ximerex, Inc. has developed an innovative and proprietary technology known as surrogate tolerogenesis (ST). With ST pig islets can be transplanted without rejection or immune suppression. ST is supported by extensive proof of principle, including pig islets to diabetic monkey transplants with prolonged survival and function without immune suppression.     The program was recently reviewed by the NIH commercialization assistance program (CAP). A large panel of experts in business development concluded that the technology does provide a strong competitive advantage and is protected by a robust patent portfolio. However, the regulatory hurdles are substantial, requiring FDA approval for commercialization. Ximerex, Inc. is unlikely to attract private investments until the FDA allows phase I/II trails. Many specific suggestions were made.     RFA-OD-09008 (an RC3 BRDG-SPAN pilot program) targets small companies such as Ximerex, Inc. in the   Valley of Death  , i.e. with extensive proof ofprinciple but unable to attrac investors.     This proposal takes the steps necessary for initial clinical trials and subsequent investment based development. Specifically, it includes a large definitive pig to nonhuman primate transplant study to establish efficacy of ST to the FDA; recruitment of a chief medical officer for  planning clinical trials and interacting with the FDA; and development of facilities and labs for the FDA certified swine source herd and tissue processing. Furthermore, this proposal transforms the program from one based on the founder to a multi-institutional partnership, including the University of Miami-Diabetes Research Institute with their wealth of knowledge and facilities.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: While developing our technologies in the field of transplantation, we have measured our progress with both success and failure. Through these trials we have developed a simple idea into what may change our ability to treat disease, putting transplantation of porcine tissues into the limelight. This project fully develops transplantation f pig islets into diabetic patients without rejection of the tissue and without the need for immune suppression. The aims of this project will demonstrate the recent refinements to the technology and lead to initial clinical trials.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The number of adults and children who are overweight or obese continues to increase and has reached epidemic proportions. Obesity is due to a sustained positive energy balance (energy intake gt energy expenditure) and is typically coupled with low levels of physical activity (i.e. sedentary lifestyles). The combination of obesit and inactivity has resulted in increased morbidity and mortality from hypertension, stroke, coronary artery disease, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes, sleep apnea and a number of other conditions. To reduce these health risks, individuals are advised to monitor and manage their weight by altering lifestyle and engaging in daily physical activity. Posture allocation (time spen lying, sitting and standing) reflects an individual lifestyle and is related to obesity, which suggests that the ability to monitor posture allocation may be useful for weight management. Instruments that monitor body weight and quantify physical activity (e.g. accelerometers) have proven to be beneficial for individuals engaged in weight management programs but have limited accuracy in free-living conditions. A single device that accurately monitors body weight, posture allocation, physical activity (i.e. movement), and energy expenditure would be an extremely useful tool for weight management. Our long-term objective is to develop a simple, inexpensive, unobtrusive device that can easily be incorporated into conventional footwear and can accurately measure body weight, posture allocation, physical activity and daily energy expenditure. Such a device could be used to quantify and modify physical activity and lifestyle behavior in overweight and obese individuals and others with sedentary lifestyles. We propose that by developing afootwear-based hardware system that measure plantar pressure and acceleration of the foot, combined with a software system that classifies activities and energy expenditure and provides feedback via a mobile phone, we will offer a device that can assist insuccessful weight management in free-living adults. The proposed methodology is based on inexpensive technology that would enable research, clinical and consumer applications for estimating daily energy expenditure and behavior modification.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Obesity is a chief contributor to preventable deaths in the United States and poses a major health challenge associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Obesity is a result of positive energy balance and there is an urgent needto develop tools that can ultimately be used to prevent and treat obesity by changing physical activity behavior.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To develop an oral anti-TNF antibody therapeutic that is safe and effective enough to be used as a first line therapy for inflammatory bowel disease.  Problem: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) comprises two chronic inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract: Crohn&#039;s disease and ulcerative colitis. Approximately 1 million people in the U.S. suffer from IBD, with direct healthcare costs of  6.3B/year and costs for lost work of  3.6B/year. Injectable anti-TNF antibodies are highly effective in treating inflammatory bowel disease. However, because they neutralize TNF throughout the body, their use is associated with serious side effects such as reactivation of tuberculosis and long-term risk of malignancy. This limits their use to 2nd or 3rd line treatment of severe/refractory IBD.  Avaxia&#039;s Solution: Avaxia is developing AVX-470h, an oral polyclonal anti-TNF antibody therapeutic for IBD from the early milk (colostrum) of immunized cows. Bovine colostral antibodies are ideal for oral delivery, as the antibodies are stable to gastric digestion and there is a long history of safe human exposure. With the support of the SBIR Phase I grant, we established that oral delivery of AVX-470m (bovine antibody specific for murineTNF) significantly reduced the severity of colitis in the well-established TNBS and DSS mouse models of IBD while blood levels remained low. We hypothesize that oral administration of AVX-470h (bovine antibody  specific for human TNF) to human subjects will enable targeted distribution to the site of inflammation in the  gut, with minimal systemic exposure, thus eliminating side effects while maintaining therapeutic efficacy.  Specific Aims: 1) To define the pharmacokinetics and determinants of efficacy inanimal models of IBD. AVX- 470m will be evaluated in murine TNBS- and DSS-induced colitis models, selecting a single model for further analysis and defining the effects of dose and dosing regimen on efficacy, local and systemic exposure, immune function and immunogenicity. These studies will define the variables important in the clinical use and testing of AVX-470h. 2) To produce AVX-470h (bovine anti-human TNF antibody) for use in preclinical development in Aim 3. Cows will be immunized with human TNF andimmunoglobulin will be purified from the immune colostrum. 3) To define the pharmacology of TNF inhibition by AVX-470m and AVX-470h. The molecular and cellular pharmacology of AVX-470m and AVX-470h will be defined by measuring TNF binding, neutralizationand specificity. The goal of Aim 3 is to bridge between the anti-murine TNF (AVX-470m) used in preclinical studies and the anti-human TNF (AVX-470h) to be used in clinical trials. Development of clinical drug supply, toxicology work and regulatory filingsfor AVX-470h will be carried out in parallel with SBIR Phase II studies but funded independently.  If AVX-470m is efficacious in murine colitis models with minimal systemic exposure and the TNF pharmacology profile of AVX-470h mimics AVX-470m, we will filean IND and proceed to clinical testing of AVX-470h.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Crohn&#039;s Disease and Ulcerative Colitis, collectively known as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), are serious chronic diseases that afflict over 1 million Americans, costing the U.S. economy an estimated  6.3 billion in direct healthcare costs and  3.6 billion in lost work time each year. Our SBIR Phase I studies showed that  AVX-470, Avaxia&#039;s orally delivered anti-TNF antibody therapeutic, is effective at treating mouse models of IBD  and does not produce blood levels of antibody that are associated with immunosuppression (a major side  effect of currently marketed anti-TNF antibodies administered by injection that limits their use to patients with  severe disease). This proposal is  focused on advancing AVX-470 toward an IND filing with the goal of developing an oral anti-TNF antibody therapeutic that is safe and effective enough to be used as a first line  therapy to prevent the progression of IBD to severe disease.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT  Conventional culture vessels are not designed for physiological oxygen delivery. Both hyperoxia and hypoxia - commonly observed when culturing cells and tissues in regular plasticware- have been linked to reduced cellular function and death. An adequate means to provide oxygenation is also critical for stem cell applications in which the differentiation outcome is dependent on oxygen tension levels. We have addressed this problem by devising a novel culture device, the   oxygen sandwich  . This simple system is designed to deliver oxygen in a quasi-physiological fashion by means of a basal air-permeable perfluorocarbon-silicone (PFC/Si) membrane. Our long-term goal is to establish this system as a new standard for tissue culture, both for applications in which oxygen diffusion rates become limiting (such as 3D culture) and for those that require precise adjustments of oxygenation to steer stem cell differentiation in the desired direction. We will focus our proof-of- concept work on islet/beta cellbiology. This is a rapidly expanding market that includes clinical uses (islet transplantation), active in vitro research on adult/fetal islets of several species, and pre-clinicl stem cell research with the potential to revolutionize the treatment of diabetes within the next 5-10 years. The pertinence of our model choice is highlighted by two well-documented observations: [1] Pancreatic beta cells (the current end product used in clinical therapies for diabetes) are highly sensitive to sub- and super-physiological oxygen concentrations; and [2] Stem cell differentiation into beta cells (the subject of worldwide research to replace cadaveric islets for future clinical uses) is exquisitely dependent on evolving oxygen tensions. Our Phase I studies aimed at demonstrating that the enhanced in vitro survival and function observed in PFC/Si-cultured islets also resulted in better pre-clinical transplantation outcomes using a marginal mass xenotransplantation model (human islets into diabetic nu/nu immunodeficientmice). After the successful completion of these studies, our Phase II proposal is based on the following specific aims: (1) Scaling-up and definition of manufacturing process (QA and QC, sterilization) for mass production of PFC/Si culture devices; and (2)biological testing and reproducibility studies in human islets and embryonic stem cells (hESc). This application benefits from the assembly of first-rate teams with highly complementary expertise. Our Phase I results are strongly supportive of the feasibility of this proposal. Success in our research would fill a widely acknowledged gap in our ability to preserve islet cell function and survival in vitro confirming this system as a potential new standard for beta cell biology and differentiation studies. As such positive outcome might ultimately speed up the applicability of new-generation beta cell replacement therapies, this project is greatly relevant to the mission of the National Institutes of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK). Successin these studies will also provide proof of principle of the superiority of our oxygen enhancing technology for many other cell culture applications.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current gold standards for hemodialysis access to treat End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), radial cephalic vein fistulas and autogenous saphenous veins, have significant problems associated with their use. The issues rangefrom unavailability of a healthy vein the patient can spare complexity of harvesting and longevity of the surgical procedure to the long time (4-6 months) required for healing of the fistula. Synthetic grafts made of ePTFE and polyurethane (PU) have issues of low patency (20% for 2 years), delayed access time to first puncture (more than 3 weeks), infection, weeping (leading to hematomas/seroma formation) and kinking of the native vein resulting in graft thrombosis. Thus, there is a need to develop an off-the shelf prosthetic graft that would give comparable or higher patency to autologous grafts or fistulas, eliminate/reduce infection, prevent surface thrombus formation inhibit uncontrolled cellular proliferation throughout graft and most importantly, provide instant access to puncture. Research objectives proposed and accomplished in Phase I were: 1) synthesis of a novel nanofibrous bioactive hemodialysis graft (BioAccess) via electrospinning of polyester and polyurethane in combination with antithrombin,antimicrobial and anti-proliferative agents, 2) characterization of the physical and chemical properties of the BioAccess graft, 3) determination of the release pharmacokinetics from the BioAccess graft, and 4) evaluation of the biologic properties of theBioAccess grafts after undergoing stringent wash conditions. The goal of the Phase II study is to assess in vivo the BioAccess grafts (6mm ID) as well as clinically utilized ePTFE grafts in a canine arteriovenous (carotid artery to jugular vein) shunt access model. BioAccess grafts will be evaluated for patency, infection-resistance, gross hematoma formation, surface thrombus formation and hyperplasia formation after being punctured various times for 30 and 60 days. Our hypothesis is that the BioAccess Graft will become the new standard for hemodialysis access by outperforming ePTFE grafts in terms of immediate access, reduced hematoma formation, low incidences of infection and increased primary patency rates. The BioAccess graft will be superior to ePTFE grafts due to its better mechanical compliance in conjunction with localized release of antithrombotic, antimicrobial and anti- proliferative agents, thereby regulating any potential complications directly at the graft surface. The specific objectives for Phase II are to: 1) electrospin BioAccess grafts for implantation studies, qualify physical, chemical and surface properties of BioAccess grafts, 3) confirm biologic properties of BioAccess graft using established assays employed in Phase I, 4) implant BioAccess and control ePTFE grafts into a canine arteriovenous shunt access model for 30 and 60 days in conjunction with numerous needle punctures and 5) macroscopically and histologically analyze explanted BioAccess and ePTFE grafts. The overall annual cost ofESRD treatment in the US is  23 billion, which is projected to increase at an annual rate of 3.6%. About 2 million patients worldwide (355,000 in US alone) currently will receive hemodialysis treatment by 2012. Approximately 140,000 access grafts are currently implanted in the US at a total healthcare cost of  80 million. Temporary catheters are the most expensive of all the ESRD treatments for Medicare, costing about  77,000/person/year, a cost that can be avoided by immediate access through a permanent arteriovenous graft. With the increase in aging population of ESRD patients, higher occurrence of diabetes and obesity, the options for a patient are reduced to immediate hemodialysis. Thus, there is an increasing demand for hemodialysis grafts with immediate access and better healing properties.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Current gold standards for hemodialysis access to treat End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), radial cephalic vein fistulas and autogenous saphenous veins, have significant problems associated with their use.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The National Institutes of Health desires to have more economical methods to produce 18-labeled oxygen and, in particular, 18-labeled water for use in energy expenditure and body composition studies. This oxygen-18 is converted into fluorinated-18 isotopes to produce radiopharmaceuticals for medical imaging using Positron Emission Tomography (PET). The availability of the 18-labeled water feedstock is limited, costly, and with the growth in new radiopharmaceuticals, thisfeedstock will soon not be able to meet the demand. Thus, there is an urgent need to recycle the spent singly labeled water during cyclotron operations used to produce the radiopharmaceuticals. During a Phase I program, Reactive Innovations, LLC demonstrated a new process to recover and purify the oxygen-18 labeled water used in producing these radiopharmaceuticals. With this system, a higher conversion yield is possible for converting the singly labeled water into fluorinated-18 compounds. This helps themedical imaging profession increase the use of PET for medical diagnostics, lowers the costs for the expensive radiopharmaceuticals, and maintains a sufficient supply of radiopharmaceuticals to sustain the rapidly growing usage of PET. During the Phase IIprogram, Reactive Innovations and its commercialization partner will develop and integrate this water recovery and purification process into existing radiopharmaceutical facilities.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) using[F-18] fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) as well as other fluorine-18 based radiopharmaceuticals is a rapidly growing diagnostic imaging tool for assessing glucose metabolism in the heart, lungs, and brain, as well as for imaging tumors in oncology. Central to thesuccess of PET is converting the limited supply of the expensive oxygen-18 labeled water feedstock into these fluorinated-18 compounds without discarding the spent water.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic kidney disease (CKD) remains an unsolved challenge for the nephrologist, as it almost inevitably leads to end-stage renal failure, a life-threatening condition that necessitates renal replacement therapy. Few, if any, of the currently practiced therapeutic strategies oppose the molecular and cellular program of fibrosis that drives renal disease. There is now mounting evidence that certain receptor tyrosine kinases including platelet derived growth factor (PDGF)and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) are promising targets for development of anti-fibrotic strategies. Under the aegis of the SBIR Phase I program and harnessing a drug discovery engine comprising molecular modeling, rational drug design, medicinal chemistry and in vitro biology, Angion Biomedica has synthesized a highly water soluble, orally bioavailable, small molecule PDGFR+KDR inhibitor, ANG3070. Critical and highly compelling data indicate that ANG3070 is therapeutic in experimental CKD, reducing microalbuminuria and urine TGF21, decreasing renal interstitial collagen accumulation and other markers of renal fibrosis and preserving renal parenchymal microarchitecture. The goal of this proposed milestone driven SBIR Phase II translational research program is to conduct the comprehensive gamut of Investigational New Drug (IND)-enabling studies required to advance our novel, orally bioavailable, small molecule therapeutics to clinical trials in CKD, one of the largest markets of unmet clinical need.

Inulin is the gold standard fo measuring GFR. A sensitive, specific and easy assay to measure inulin is most likely to be accepted for general research, clinical research, and in the clinic. Inulin is free of any controversy associated with gadolinium chelates often proposed as GFR probes. We have completed all specific aims outlined in our Phase I application yielding a research immunoassay for inulin and a diagnostic test to measure glomerular filtration rate. Our inulin ELISA avoids the  shortcomings of other inulin assays, is easy to perform, cost effective, highly specific, and far more sensitive than currently available inulin assays. All reagents are stable, the lower limit of inulin detection is less than 10ng/ml, the specificity of the antibody for inulin allows discrimination between inulin and all common sugars and polysaccharides. Completion of Phase II will see the launch of two products and one service. The two products are inulin in sodium chloride injection, USP, and acGMP FIT-GFR inulin kit. The service provides a CLIA licensed laboratory equipped to measure and report GFR (mGFR) determinations from samples obtained from research laboratories, veterinary and medical practices.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We seek to develop a novel insulin analog to enhance the safety and efficacy of insulin pump therapy with broad application to the Artificial Pancreas Project (  smart pumps  ). A proprietary approach is proposed basedon the favorable physico-chemical properties conferred by chloro-aromatic substitutions in the insulin molecule. This Phase 2 SBIR application thus builds on progress obtain in the Phase 1 program in the characterization of 4-Cl-PheB24-KP-insulin. In thisderivative of insulin lispro (the active component of Humalog; Eli Lilly and Co) the para proton of the aromatic ring of PheB24 is substituted by a larger and electronegative halogen atom. Results of Phase 1 studies established that this substitution (i) is compatible with native receptor-binding affinity and natie biological potency; (ii) leads to an accelerated rate of disassembly of the insulin hexamer in vitro; (iii) is associated with foreshortened pharmacodynamics of insulin action in euglycemic clampstudies in a pig model; and (iv) augments the resistance of insulin to physical degradation above room temperature on gentle agitation as in a pump reservoir. This unique confluence of advantageous features predicts significant clinical advantages both with respect to patient convenience and with respect to the performance of control algorithms employed in CGM-coupled closed-loop systems. Accordingly, a Phase 2 development plan is proposed in support of clinical-scale manufacture and optimization of formulation leading to I-GMP production (Aims 1-3) and formal toxicity/tolerance testing in animals in support of an IND application to the FDA (Aim 4). Achievement of these milestones will enable a future Phase 2B application in support of first-in-human trials, anticipated to be a phase 1a clamp study of healthy volunteers. The present application thus provides a logical bridge between highly promising in vitro and animal data, as generated in the Phase 1 SBIR program, and key pre-IND milestones.

The gold standard in SWL is still considered to be the Dornier HM3, which was the first lithotripter introduced into the US. The HM3 is an electrohydraulic lithotripter (EHL) that uses a single underwater   sparker   as a shock wave source. The HM3 has the drawback that the electrodes erode quickly and must be replaced in the middle of a procedure, and causes significant side effects.  This project is to develop optimized arrays several sparkers in small ellipsoidal reflectors that last for several procedures and break stones more effectively. The flexibility in placement of the sparkers allows space for an in-line probe to monitor stone location during treatment, which will result in fewer pressure pulses missing the stone and reduce damage to surrounding tissue.  The specific project objectives are to optimize sparker arrays, including the use of double pulses by breaking both artificial and actual kidney stones, develop an in-line probe and conduct animal studies to investigate side-effects and to support an IDE. A successful Phase II will lead to the development of a prototype and clinical studies and subsequent commercialization.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There are an estimated 26 million Americans with early chronic kidney disease (CKD). Early diagnosis and treatment are the only cost-effective means to reverse this growing problem. NIH recognizes the challenge to diagnose CKD early during its initiation and development phases in order to prevent further renal damage, reduce cardiovascular risk, and minimize the economic impact of CKD. Current methods and biomarkers that are used to assess CKD are effective once the disease is well established but are not reliable for the detection of early disease. Further, many patients initially determined to  have a mild decline in kidney function by the current methods may actually be misclassified and possibly under-diagnosed, resulting in a patient having undiagnosed moderate to severe kidney damage. We will produce a new ELISA for CKD to be employed as a diagnostic test based upon the use of a novel biomarker that reflects early events in the pathophysiology of kidney disease. Detection of this biomarker for CKD will give laboratory results and clinical insight that  are complementary to creatinine-based glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimates as well as tests for urine albumin. This should result is a more reliable and earlier identification of CKD.  n addition, our CKD-Assay would give physicians the ability to evaluate patients that have been recently diagnosed with hypertension or diabetes. In Phase I, we evaluated the feasibility and proof-of principal of this test and foundthat the prototype assay in both populations was highly sensitive and specific. In Phase II, we will look for the influence of comorbid conditions and medications on assay performance, compare our results to the gold standard assay of GFR, and follow up patients over at least 3 years to evaluate the ability of this biomarker to follow progression of CKD. Lastly, we will evaluate whether patient characteristics such as age, gender, BMI, ethnicity, and other factors impact on assay performance. We request Phase II support so that we can evaluate the prototype assay and further test its feasibility to help identiy at-risk patients for early kidney disease and monitor therapy with the ultimate goal of obtaining FDA approval and reducing the societal impact of under-diagnosed CKD.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic Kidney Disease affects nearly 26 million people in the United States, which places them at higher risk of cardiovascular disease and hemodialysis. We will develop an assay for the identificationof people with advanced kidney disease that are under-diagnosed by current methods and to aid physicians in earlier treatment and better assessment of chronic kidney disease.",

In phase I we showed success with utterances that contained 2 concepts (10-15 words). In Phase II our goal is to extend that capability to handle a sequence of at least 5 concepts.  3) Patient education support. We observed in Phase I that pharmacists spend considerable time going over basic concepts or ideas in the domain (use of insulin, balanced meal, exercising, etc.). The translation system will be extended to support the patient education component of the MTM approach. This project addresses the growing problem of diabetes management among Hispanics with Limited English Proficiency (LEP). The development and testing of the proposed translation system will achieve: deployment of a lower-cost translation alternative for community clinics; opening of communityclinic doors to non-Spanish- speaking English language health professional volunteers to participate in diabetes patient care; enhancement of the Teach-back component of the practitioner visit by ensuring comprehension of MTM recommendations during the visit; and demonstrate the viability of large scale clinical speech translation systems creatin the possibility of systems for many additional domains.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this proposal, Fluential, Inc. and UCSF propose to develop and evaluate a comprehensive real-time speech translation system to facilitate Medication Therapy Management (MTM) of Limited English Proficient (LEP) patients with diabetes patients who primarily speak Spanish.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies are the most common cause of cancer in the world. Of the 10.8 million people in the world each year who develop cancer, approximately 3.3 million have GI malignancies. Until recently,the only sections of the GI tract that could be imaged were the esophagus, stomach and colon through traditional endoscopy. Initial segments of the small bowel were imaged using techniques such as push enteroscopy or radioactive imaging techniques, but these methods present significant discomfort to the patients, costly, or lack sensitivity. Capsule endoscopy (CE) is a new technique that is changing the landscape of GI endoscopic diagnosis. CE is a widely acclaimed breakthrough in GI, especially small bowelimaging. However, current CE video display/analysis software (SW) is falling far behind. It has limitations including lengthy video viewing and interpreting time (e.g. ~2 hours) and is difficult in analyzing (e.g. visualizing) findings. These SW issues have incurred considerable amount of costs to patients, and need to be addressed urgently. To address this problem, together with our collaborators, we propose to develop a novel software system to fully automate the video review process and achieve comprehensive and accurate disease analysis. The proposed software system will have the following clinic impact and significance:  3/4 Fully automated and efficient disease detection and classification from CE videos; 3/4 Comprehensive visualization or analysis tool for more accurate disease diagnosis; 3/4 No more missing GI disorder areas from the review process; 3/4 A low cost SW system for better mass acceptance and effective disease prevention; and 3/4 Modular, expandable, and scalable technology. The proprietary software modular (functionally) technology developed can be easily applied to existing diagnosis instruments.  The Millennium Research Group predicted the capsule endoscopy market to generate more than  180 million in 2009 in the United States alone - up from just  40 million in 2004. The predicted CAGR is 35.1% during 2008 - 2015. According to Given Imaging Ltd., more than one million patients worldwide have gone through capsule endoscopy procedure using their PillCam capsules. Capsule endoscopy is a rapidly-growing multi-billion dollar market (predicted to reach billion dollar mark in 2015 worldwide). The commercialization potential of the proposed software system and technology is significant.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This grant application is initiated by Ion Channel Innovations, LLC., (ICI) an early stage biotechnology company that has completed the first, and only, phase I safety trial using plasmid DNA transfer with a non-specific gene MaxiK potassium channel promoter to treat urinary urgency, frequency, nocturia, and incontinence also known as overactive bladder or OAB a disease that affect 17 million persons in the US. There were no gene transfer related serious adverse events in either the short or long term follow-up of that trial. The goal of this application is to potentially improve the efficacy of the company&#039;s product. The hypothesis of this grant is whether or not a cell-specific promoter of the maxi-K gene alone, or in combination with another cell specific promoter, better reduce or prevent bladder smooth muscle overactivity than does a non-specific CMV promoter of the MaxiK channel. To test that hypothesis the grant has two specific aims. In Specific Aim 1 a vector willbe constructed in which the gene for the MaxiK potassium channel (hSlo) will be expressed from a urothelial cell specific promoter. That promoter that will be compared in a variety of cell types (tissue cultured rat urothelium, rat bladder smooth muscle,and HEK cells) to cell type specific expression of hSlo from two other well characterized constructs (expressing hSlo from a non-cell-type specific promoter (CMV) and a smooth muscle specific promoter (SMAA). Specific Aim 2 will determine which specific promoter driving hSlo expression best reverses bladder smooth muscle hyperactivity in an in vivo animal model of OAB using standard urodynamic parameters. The expected results are that the urothelial specific promoter alone or in combination with the smoothmuscle promoter will be significantly more effective in reducing bladder smooth muscle overactivity when compared to use of the non-specific CMV promoter. If the hypothesis is proved correct with statistical evidence that one or more specific promoters ofthe MaxiK gene better treats the symptoms of OAB the company will extend its patent portfolio, begin commercial production of the product, and immediately use the product in IND approved trials. The development of a safe and effective long lasting therapyfor OAB will be a major medical advance.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The clinical significance of chronic pro-inflammatory reactions in dialysis patients due to exposure to endotoxin has become a central issue in nephrology. The European Renal Association urges the routine use of ultrapure dialysate with bacteria and endotoxin levels of lt  0.1 CFU/ml and lt  0.03 EU/ml, respectively. In the US, the maximum allowable limit of bacteria in water is 200 cfu/ml and the maximum allowable limit for endotoxin is 2 EU/ml. Considering the clinicalimplications and risks of exposing dialysis patients to a high level of cytokine- inducing molecules on a continuous basis, the US needs to quickly move to adopt the ultrapure dialysate (UPD) ISO 1163:2009 Standard. However, considering the state of US dialysis water systems, meeting such standard will be impossible to achieve without adopting new technologies that can eradicate biofilm from the dialysis water systems and correcting some inherent deficiencies in current maintenance protocols. In this FastTrack application, we propose to develop an integrated strategy to produce UPD based on using our CleanFlow   device which delivers the highly effective two-phase flow (TPF) process. This strategy must consider treating all the surfaces of the water systemto the point where the dialysate enters the dialyzer. In this project we will develop methods and protocols to test the integrated strategy in dialysis clinics. We will verify that we can reduce inflammation markers (IL-6 and CRP) in patients treated withdialysate made according to this new strategy. The integrated strategy will include: 1) cleaning the distribution loops with the TPF process, 2) replacing the connection tubing to dialysis machines with a cleaned and disinfected set each time, and 3) ensuring that dialysis machines are equipped with a retentive ultrafilter before the dialyzer. We will compare the results of our integrated strategy with conventional methods, and will assess the impact of using or not using the ultrafilter on the results. Weplan to also include testing for bacterial DNA fragments in the dialysate before and after the ultrafilter. Development of this integrated strategy to produce UPD in US dialysis clinics is expected to decrease the chronic inflammation state in dialysis patients and increase responsiveness to erythropoietin.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Manufacturing based on photolithography has been responsible for ushering in the microelectronics era with enormous societal and economical impact. Extending microfabrication technology to 3D has the potential to revolutionize many diverse fields including biomedicine, energy conversation and storage, and photonic device manufacturing. While many 3D microfabrication techniques exist, they suffer from low throughput and/or low resolution. Importantly, these techniques arenot scalable; longer times are required to build larger devices. In this SBIR Fast Track proposal, FemtoFab Inc. seeks funding to demonstrate a novel microfabrication process, wide-field two-photon 3D lithography, which is based on temporal focusing of ultrafast light pulses. This new manufacturing technique, similar to standard 2D photolithography, is high throughput and scalable. Unlike standard photolithography, this technique is capable of manufacturing parts with 3D resolved feature. Among the many diverse applications of this 3D microfabrication process, FemtoFab Inc. has identified the manufacturing of microfluidic devices for biomedical applications as the most promising direction. In biomedicine, microfluidic devices have found applications in numerous areas, such as point-of- care diagnostic, drug discovery, and protein crystallization. The adaptation of wide-field two- photon 3D lithography for manufacturing will address the demand of microfluidic field for lower cost, higher density, and multi-functional devices. At the completion of Phase I, we will demonstrate the fabrication of microfluidic channels with complex 3D structures using this new technique. We will further quantify fabrication speed to prove that will additional investment in instrumentation will result in a microfabrication platform with industrial scale throughput. The additional resources during Phase II of this project will allow us to build and characterize an upgraded wide-field two-photon 3D lithographic microfabrication systemwith throughput and cost compatible with industrial scale manufacturing. We will further demonstrate the fabrication of complex 3D devices with integrated active microfluidic components such as pumps, valves at high speed and low cost.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a functional imaging technique with the potential to quantify the rates of biological processes in vivo. The availability of short-lived positron-emitting isotopes of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and especially fluorine allows virtually any compound of biological interest to be labeled in trace amounts and introduced into the body for imaging with PET. The distribution of the tracer is imaged dynamically, allowing the rates of biologicalprocesses to be calculated using appropriate mathematical models. PET imaging can provide diagnosis for symptoms of diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer&#039;s disease, head trauma, and stroke. It is clear that PET technology is playing a prominent and increasingly visible role in modern research and clinical diagnosis. However, to allow exploitation of the full potential of this promising technique, there is urgent need for both improvement in the performance of PET systems and reduction in their cost. Both of these factors are strongly influenced by the available detector technology. Scintillation crystals coupled to photomultiplier tubes are currently used as detectors in PET systems. Important requirements for the scintillation crystals used in PET systems include fast response, high sensitivity, high light output, good proportionality, high energy and timing resolution, and low cost. Traditional single crystals scintillators (such LSO, BGO and GSO) which are currently used in commercial PET scanners show considerable limitations either in performance aspects (such as low light output, poor proportionality and slow response) or in cost and availability aspects.  With none of the well-established scintillators able to satisfy all the stated requirements of PET, the goal of the proposed effort is to investigate a new garnet scintillator that provides high gamma-ray stopping efficiency, high light yield, and fast decay time. The energy and timing resolution of these new garnetscintillators surpass those for the existing PET scintillators. Furthermore, due to their cubic structure and the associated physical and optical isotropy, these garnet scintillators can be fabricated using ceramic fabrication techniques, with properties rivaling those of the best crystals, yetremaining cost effective for fabrication in large quantities. This approach involves developing garnet detectors in the form of optical ceramics (OCs), rather than the single crystals. Consolidation of powder into a fully dense ceramic provides many advantages over traditional single crystal growth, such as lower fabrication temperatures and simpler processing equipment.  It is the aim of this proposal to produce new garnet scintillators doped with Ce3+ and Pr3+ in the form of a fully transparent optical ceramics, which display scintillation performance better than that of best single crystals used currently in PET at significantly lower cost with wider availability. Construction and evaluation of detector modules for PET imaging based on optically transparent ceramic garnet scintillators is also planned in the proposed effort.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Improper or incomplete sterilization of manufacturing facilities is a major cause of pharmaceutical product recalls. The economic and societal impact of these recalls is significant and difficult to quantify. Many pharmaceutical companies use vapor phase hydrogen peroxide (VPHP) to decontaminate and sterilize production facilities, including barrier isolators. A reliable instrument with a large dynamic range and high sensitivity for monitoring VPHP during barrier isolator decontamination would be invaluable to manufacturers to improve product sterility assurance and quality. Physical Sciences Inc. (PSI) proposes to develop a commercial prototype sensor that will facilitate rapid and reliable development of decontaminationcycles, equipment qualification and continuous monitoring of barrier isolators, enabling significant improvements to sterility assurance, drug quality and availability. The instrument will measure VPHP and water vapor using tunable diode laser absorptionspectroscopy (TDLAS) with novel quantum cascade lasers and cavity enhanced spectroscopy. VPHP is a commonly used decontamination agent which must be carefully monitored to ensure sterility assurance and must be removed to very low levels prior to pharmaceutical filling operations due to its deleterious effects on pharmaceutical products. The sensor will be used to study vapor phase decontamination agent flow within an isolator and the effects of hydrogen peroxide destruction, adsorption and desorption for materials commonly used to fabricate isolators and in pharmaceutical fill/finish packaging operations. This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I / Phase II project addresses an immediate need for real-time measurement of trace amounts of VPHP in pharmaceutical filling and packaging systems. Barrier isolators are finding increasing use in the production and packaging of new biologic drug products. The instrument will enable production of a critical database of information for use in the pharmaceutical industry. The specific program innovation is the use of new quantum cascade laser technology with cavity enhanced spectroscopy to enable ultra-sensitive detection of critical decontamination parameters throughout the cycle and allow investigation of real-world fill/finish parameters (such as packaging material uptake of VPHP). Additional applications of the sensor include decontamination monitoring of lyophilizers and VPHP destruction of Meticillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) contamination in hospital wards. No commercially available sensor can provide continuous VPHP measurements throughout the entire decontamination and purge cycles in manufacturing scale operations. The proposed sensor will provide this capability, allowing real-time process monitoring and control. This development targets the USFDA process analytical technology (PAT) initiative for building quality into pharmaceutical products, increasing the availability of critical drug products like vaccines and reducing the costs of prescription drug products.",

The objective of this program is the development of the Germanium Gamma Cameras (GGCs) as modular component detector heads suitable for convenient integration into the molecular-imaging systems of other companies and research groups for small field-of-view SPECT and planar imaging applications, such as preclinical imaging and Breast Specific Gamma Imaging. The Germanium Gamma Cameras will be iteratively developed through the fabrication and optimization of numerous GGC prototypes. The GGC prototypes will be incrementally evolved by modifying the geometry, optimizing the spatial resolution, and increasing the size of our existing imaging germanium-detector product line. The fast-track SBIR mechanism has been selected because of the advanced starting point provided by the technical success of our existing systems and the relatively well defined geometric constraints associated with small field-of-view imaging applications.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Uncontrolled hyperbilirubinemia (jaundice) in neonates has long been known to lead to neurological dysfunction including irreversible athetoid cerebral palsy with speech, ocular and hearing impairments, and even death.Contemporary management is based upon monitoring the total serum bilirubin (TBS), taking into account other clinical parameters such as birth weight and gestational age, and administering effective treatment (phototherapy and/or the rare exchange transfusion), if dictated. Unfortunately, the trend towards discharge of apparently healthy neonates from the hospital very soon after birth has made the management of subsequent jaundice more difficult in that population. A long suggested, but not used, better predictor of the neonate&#039;s risk for neurological sequelae due to elevated bilirubin is a measure of the capacity to sequester bilirubin in the blood compartment by its binding to serum albumin. The concentration of unbound bilirubin, the driver for bilirubinescaping from the vasculature, can be calculated from the TBS and binding capacitl. Presently existing methods for assaying binding capacity and unbound bilirubin are not facile. However, all these parameters can be directly measured simply in a very smallvolume of whole blood with a special purpose fluorometer, the hematofluorometer, first described years ago, by making use of the natural fluorescence of bilirubin bound to albumin. This technology is amenable to point-of-care use.     The aims of this project are to transform the modernized and miniaturized hematofluorometer developed in Phase I into a product suitable for operation in various point-of-care environments, including the intensive care and healthy baby nurseries, the neonatal inpatient clinic, and the pediatrician&#039;s office. The first aim is to optimize the basic optical and electronic design: redesin the electronics to support the hospital information management requirements, such as a bar code reader, printer, and interface with a computer, either directly or via the local internet. The  second aim is to develop a reagent kit that is easy to use and inexpensive. Phase I work demonstrated that significantly more work is needed to design a kit meeting these requirements, and then scaling this design up into a product that can be mass produced. The third aim is to test the instrument with neonate blood samples in a clinical environment to demonstrate that it well suited to meet the needs. With this goal in mind, Stanford University&#039;s Medical School and Children&#039;s Hospital has agreed to participate as a subcontractor to evaluate the new technology. With these proposed improvements, the instrument will be ready for the next stages: releasing it to the market for immediate RandD uses and clinical studies, and eventual approval by the FDA for general use.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION: PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT. This Phase II SBIR project, Game FACTS (Fun, Adaptable-Content Trainer Suite): The Use of Microgames as a Supplemental Learning Tool for Worker Health and Safety Training builds upon the work of the previously fundedPhase I SBIR project Micro-games for WMD Training for Skilled Support Personnel. Phase I focused on the development of microgame (i.e., short-duration game) prototypes for worker health and safety training. The ultimate goals of Phase I and Phase II are tosupport interactive e- teaching in safety and health training in order to improve trainers&#039; ability to provide engaging, effective instruction, and to increase worker motivation to learn (and subsequently, efficacy) in these important topics. In doing so,WisdomTools hopes to ultimately improve both worker and public safety and health.  Based on the lessons learned in Phase I, Phase II will enhance the already strong commercialization potential of the games by addressing the need for trainers to be able tocreate, update, and alter instructional content to ensure its relevance for their own learners and worksites, simplified controls, more sophisticated support for learning game play, additional game types to suit different learning styles, and normalization of content for use in different game formats. Phase II of this project will focus on training to increase understanding and awareness of several worker health and safety topics that are the subject of frequent refresher training, including: 1) use of Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs), 2) types and selection of respiratory protection and filters, and 3) signs, symptoms, prevention, and first aid for heat-related illnesses. In addition, it will revisit the content areas selected for Phase I, which inclued: 1) Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), 2) air contaminant detection equipment, and 3) the Incident Command System.  In Phase II, WisdomTools will design, develop and test Game FACTS, a suite of advanced training technologies that includes three main components: 1) a series of six different microgame formats, 2) question and feedback content on the topics described above, including succinct and relevant information resources suitable for download or printing, and 3) an authoring tool for trainers that will allow them to update, adapt, or replace game resources, questions, and feedback with content of their own choosing to meet course needs.  Through user participatory design, semi-structured interviews, usability testing, pilot testing, and learning gains/attitudinal change analysis, this Phase II effort will examine questions related to the implementation of Game FACTS, including determining: 1) the features and functionalities that are needed to support trainers in customizing game content to meet learning goals; 2) the worker health and safety content that is most suitable and critical for repeated practice and, 3) whether the use of a game and skill-drill based learning approach produce a net positive increase in learner knowledge, skills, and attitudes(KSAs) as compared with KSAs before the training course.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Narrative By designing and developing Game FACTS (Fun, Adaptable-Content Trainer Suite): The Use of Microgames as a Supplemental Learning Tool for Worker Health andSafety Training, this Phase II SBIR project will improve worker knowledge of safe work practices across a variety of topics and improve the ability of health and safety trainers to provide learners with effective, engaging, and customized content, thus improving both worker and public health and safety. Game FACTS is an innovative game-based training suite that includes an authoring tool which allows trainers to edit, replace, and otherwise customize the content that appears inside the games to best meet the needs of their training course. This Phase II effort will build on the Phase I effort by improving existing game designs, creating new game designs, and creating the trainer authoring tool.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION: We propose to build a portable, field-deployable blood test monitor to immediately identify toxic chemical agent buildup in persons suspected of having been exposed to such agents. The technology we plan to utilize is surface- enhanced Raman scattering to look for the presence of environmental agents directly as trace contaminants in the bloodstream. The proposed system is comprised of a low-resolution Raman detection unit coupled to a strip reader that analyzes a drop of blood placed on a goldnanoparticle strip. The low-resolution surface-enhanced Raman spectrum (SERS) obtained from the blood drop on the strip is compared with a spectral peak library in the unit for analysis of the presence and concentration of specific chemical components present in the patient&#039;s blood. The Phase II research program is intended to demonstrate on real blood samples the detection capability for a device based on SERS low- resolution Raman methods in a cost-effective, commercially viable configuration. Such a device will be particularly effective in the detection of organic chemical agents in blood, including volatile organic compounds, polybrominated diphenyls (PBDEs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and toxic industrial chemical exposure such as organophosphonate pesticides, cyanide, and chemical warfare agents and their metabolites.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In the event of an environmental incident, a terrorist threat, or an industrial accident involving toxic industrial chemicals (TIC), rapididentification of the natue of the materials involved and its spread and exposure to the population is essential for proper response. Fast detection and identification of exposure to such threats can provide prompt warning of the extent and severity of theexposure and save many lives by enabling and adopting protective measures. And by identifying the presence of the actual environmental chemical agent or its metabolites promptly and at emerging concentrations, the presence of a threat may be identified and isolated early in the exposure cycle, potentially saving lives in the population at large.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of this SBIR proposal is to develop and commercialize a human 3D or mini- liver bioassay system suitable for real-time analysis of metabolic functions and long-term drug toxicity profiles. At present, liver functions are mostly studied using HepG2 cell line and primary hepatocytes cultured onto collagen or polymer matrices. However, these 2D monolayer models allow only partial or short-term toxicity analysis due to rapid loss of metabolic functions.Interestingly, spheroid formation in 3D matrix/scaffold cultures is shown to improve host cell functions. In Phase I studies, we successfully demonstrated the feasibility of a new human bioscaffold- 3D HuBiogel (high-density gel) for supporting long-termsurvival and maintenance of primary liver cells. Moreover, integration of rotary bioreactor system allowed efficient production/analysis of viable mini-liver spheroids. We now propose to complete the development of new 3D-liver bioassay platform that exhibits improved metabolic functions, and thus will enable precise drug toxicity testing in vitro.  Phase II specific goals are: 1. Establish an efficient hepatic cells cultivation protocol by optimizing 3D HuBiogel scaffolds and rotary bioreactor or perfusionculture strategies; 2. Test functionality of 3D-liver culture model by evaluating key biochemical and metabolism endpoints; and 3. Validate the practical utility of mini-liver assay system via real- time analysis of CYP450 induction and chemical/drug toxicity responses. Comparative control studies will include 3D culture scaffolds of Type-I collagen or Matrigel as well as fresh human liver-slice cultures. High throughput adaptability of 3D-liver bioassay will also be examined for toxicogenomics via CYP-microarrays. Thus, biologic relevance of new marketable 3D-liver bioassay system will be confirmed for improved drug toxicity analysis/prediction in humans. We are confident this advanced in vitro hepatotoxicity model will positively impact basic, preclinicaland biomedical research arenas. Commercial Importance and Significance: No acceptable commercial liver toxicity assay currently exists which utilizes a human bio-scaffold culture system. VBI will develop a market-ready 3D-liver assay platform adaptable toHTS applications. Sale of 3D HuBiogel culture kits or in-house bioassay services would have significant world-wide market, as a research and diagnostic tool.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Current cell-based assay models for studying drug metabolism and toxicity are of limited utility because isolated liver cells die rapidly in their no-physiologic, 2-dimensional (2D) culture formats. In Phase I, we have shown that a novel human 3-dimensional (3D or high- density) biomatrix scaffold- HuBiogel   supportslong-term cultivation, survival and functions of primary human liver cells. In Phase II, we will complete the development of new mini-liver bioassay platform by employing 3D HuBiogel scaffolds combined with rotary or perfusion culture techniques. High throughput utility of this robust 3D hepatotoxicity assay will greatly advance biochemical, metabolic and molecular analysis beyond 2D culture methods. Thus, our RandD effort provides a much needed in vitro tool for real-time analysis of chemical/drug metabolism and liver toxicity responses in humans. A successful outcome will offer new market-ready bioassay kits and services with world-wide demand in both basic and pharmaceutical research areas.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Development of a phase 2 beta for demonstration in Tree Top juice processing plant of a Field Applicable Real-time Remote Monitoring Sensor Device capable of detecting multiple pesticides simultaneously in unfiltered juice, fluid or waste water. We propose to further develop the carbon nanotube matrices active biosensor area for effective immobilization of multiple pesticides, as well as preservation and manufacturing specifications of the sensors. Our phase 1 work resulted in a prototype for an automated real time system and has demonstrated sensitivities from 1ppt to 10ppm with very low cross reactivity in the detection of Atrazine, Chloropyrifos, and Malathion.     Principal Investigator: Anne Schwartz CEO DN, Subcontract PI&#039;s: Dr. Jeff Jenkins OSU.  Assisting: Dr. Craig Marcus, Dr. Guenter Schneider and Dr. Ethan Minot OSU.     Phase 2 (The Sensor): This work, will utilize an ultra sensitive electrochemical sensing platform based on aligned MWCNT for voltammetric analysis of pesticides. We will examine the capability and performance of the carbon nano-array based sensing unit and develop simultaneous and continuous detection of multiple pesticides. Part of this work will be preservation and shelf life testing of thesensor and optimization for automated use in waste water and food processing plants. We will use computational physics to predict adhesion strength of nanomaterial binding for system optimization.     Phase 2 (The System): Further development of electronic hardware to fabricate a 80 sensor multiplexed disposable array, automated delivery and clearance of fluid samples to the test sensor using a proprietary design for an electronic microfluidic pump mechanism and wireless data transmission for alerts to process controls of food processing lines and waste water systems.     Application of the Project to Product Development and Commercialization: Statement of the problem; our nation&#039;s food and water quality is at risk since we cannot afford the man power and time it takes to sample and analyze water using current methods. The risk pesticides pose has been grossly underestimated. A recent study, of the U.S. 2009 Geological survey done by NOAA Fisheries Service and Washington State University, indicates that thecombined effect of multiple pesticides is far more dangerous to the health than was estimated by analyzing the results for the effect of each pesticide individually(1). In fact when juvenile salmon were exposed to only two pesticides at once they immediately died. These were common pesticides that were thought to be safe. These pesticides are linked to ADHD in children (2).This lack in capability of providing comprehensive pesticide testing for the health of the public is not limited  to Oregon; it is a national problem.     Solution: A field applicable real-time remote monitoring device to detect pesticides in water and food would allow Food Processors, DEQ, EPA, and NIEH researchers to get enough data on the relationship between environmental and industrial or agricultural factors and specific mechanisms that effect water and food quality, to effect change. Currently there is not enough data to develop comprehensive and effective plans for managing pesticides. Also real-time, sensitive to ppt, measurement is needed for food processors to adjust processes in time to lower the amount of pesticides in food. Dahl Natural, ASU and OSU are partnering to demonstrate feasibility of this technology so that it can be commercialized to provide a solution to this healthand environmental threatening problem.     Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: Unique to this solution is the ability of this device to be deployed in an aquatic environment for from one to two years without the need for servicing until the end ofthat time period. In addition the data can be remotely sent too many different data bases at once. Hence the commercial application and benefits to the NIEH and the public are many and include food processing, waste water monitoring and alarm systems, superfund site monitoring, timely individual wastewater discharge permits issued, establishment of a comprehensive data base for NIEH, DEQ, EPA and University researchers.     The market for pesticide testing is over 1 Billion dollars a year. The low cost ofthe sensors and dramatic cost saving per     test (from  200 to  600 a day per pesticide for one mean sample to over 50 mean samples per day for as little as  30.00) as well as increase access to internet /intranet accessible data.     Key Words: Remote Monitoring of Pesticides in Water, Electrochemical Sensor, Self-assembled MWCNT, and antibody based conjugation, Malathion, Chloropyrifos, Atrazine.     Summary for Members of Congress: The NIEH has funded a ground breaking research effort which could dramatically improve our nation&#039;s ability to detect threats to food, drinking water, lakes, rivers and ocean aquatic environments. This new technology will be able to remotely monitor toxic pesticides for 1-2 years at a time.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This Phase 2 project to demonstrate a real-time automated device to measure pesticides from 1ppt to 10ppm in a juice processors&#039; plant would dramatically impact the health of the public especially the health of children by reducing exposure through food andwater.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many prescribed drugs exhibit drug-drug interactions due to up-regulation or inhibition of specific P450 enzymes. According to a recent guidance from the FDA, CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4 induction should be evaluated inat least an in vitro system. Enzymatic activity in freshly isolated hepatocytes is the   Gold Standard   for studying P450 induction; however, its application is hindered by variation among donors and limited supply. In addition, the exact mechanism of P450 induction cannot be revealed, and induction may be over shadowed by simultaneous inhibition of enzyme activity. Within the last few years, the mechanisms for the induction of individual P450 isoforms have been extensively explored using reporter gene systems. Many CYPs are induced by similar mechanisms through PXR, CAR, or AHR, and yet differential responses are observed among different CYPs due to preferential nuclear receptor binding or interactions with other nuclear receptors or transcription  factors. During Phase I of this study, we established SEAP reporter constructs for CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4 each containing human genomic sequence carrying all known and putative regulatory elements required to mediate induction to xenobiotics as in liver cells. Using Originus&#039; patented STEP (Surface Transfection and Expression Protocol) technology, these reporters were co-introduced with necessary transcription factors and nuclear receptors into human hepatoma cell lines to produce responses comparable to humanhepatocytes. The CYP-SEAP reporter assay protocol is much simpler than measuring enzyme activity or mRNA, and media samples can be collected at multiple time points to monitor the kinetics of induction. Prototypes of these STEP plates were tested in houseand validated externally with excellent robustness and reproducibility. During Phase II, we will further optimize the induction assays by supplementing additional nuclear receptors and transcription factors critical for the modulation of  CYP promoter activities. In addition, we will expand the spectrum of reporters to include P450 CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which are not commercially available. Further, we will transfer the reporter system into a more physiological relevant immortalized human hepatocyte cell line, Fa2N-4, to mimic the metabolism and physiological response of hepatocytes, and yet provide specific P450 induction information in a simple and reliable assay format. These assays will be applied in a high throughput screening facility on a representative drug library. Finally, we will standardize the manufacturing, packaging, and storage protocol for extended shelf life and reproducibility. The assay protocol will also be streamlined to be more user friendly and readily compatible with other assays (suchas for cytotoxicity or enzyme activity measurement). Ultimately, the Phase II will lead to two lines of assay systems: one for studying individual induction mechanisms of CYP P450 in hepatoma cells, and the second for assaying the physicological CYP induction response using Fa2N-4 cells.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Drug safety is one of the major factors for compound attrition during clinical development. Simple assays for fast evaluation of metabolism and toxicology of compounds are urgently neededto minimize patient risks and improve the success rate of new molecular entities early in the drug discovery pipeline. The goal of this proposal is to use Originus&#039; proprietary technology, STEP, to develop platforms for in vitro evaluation of drug candidates that may induce certain hepatic enzymes (cytochrome P450s) triggering drug-drug interactions and compromising the health of the patient.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Trichloroethylene (TCE), one of the most common groundwater pollutants, is a known hepatotoxin and carcinogen. It has been widely used by industry and the military as a solvent and degreaser. According to the Agency forToxic Substances and Disease Registry, more than eight hundred Superfund sites in the United States are contaminated with TCE. Poplar, which can accumulate and degrade TCE, is an attractive plant for phytoremediation of TCE and other organic contaminantsdue to its high growth rate, extensive root system, high rates of water uptake from the soil, and ease of genetic manipulation. While transgenic poplar for improved TCE degradation has been successfully field tested, there are significant regulatory and breeding hurdles preventing the large-scale use of this technology. Recently, researchers have determined the potential of endophytes, symbiotic bacteria and fungi that live within plant cells, to break down organic contaminants and improve the phytoremediation capability of non-transgenic plants. Unlike other microbes that have been used for phytoremediation, endophytes live within the plant and therefore are expected to persist better at the site, continuing to degrade TCE as long as their plant partner survives. Dr. Sharon Doty, partner on the Phase I research and Phase II proposal, isolated a bacterial strain from poplar growing in sites contaminated with TCE and other organic pollutants that exhibited high rates of TCE degradation. Phase I results demonstrated the ability of this bacterial endophyte to persist in the roots of poplar trees and significantly enhance the degradation of TCE compared to control poplar. In Phase II, the field testing of this TCE bacterial endophyte will be accomplished at two TCE-contaminated sites for removal of TCE from groundwater compared to control poplar. In addition, the inclusion of a bacterial endophyte recently identified  as a PAH degrader will also be tested in separate poplars and in those also inoculated with the TCE endophyte to determine the efficiency of this endophyte to degrade PAHs in the presence and absence of TCE. Because poplar is also a potential biomass energy crop, the potential use of the biomass for biopower or biofuel production following remedial activities will be investigated. Upon successful completion of this SBIR project, Edenspace will partner with Geosyntec, Inc., a leading environmental engineering firm, to introduce this novel technology to the remediation industry.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Trichloroethylene (TCE) is a known carcinogen and significant environmental contaminant as a result of extensive use by the military and industry. Poplar trees have been used as a natural method to remove TCE from contaminated groundwater. This NIHPhase II SBIR proposal seeks to continue development of poplars containing endophytes that are known degraders of TCE. Such endophytic poplars are expected to enhance TCE removal rates, thereby reducing exposure of TCE to humans and wildlife.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed project will develop and demonstrate a miniaturized, portable aerosol sampler that will collect a series of time- and location-resolved personal exposure samples for conducting research into the relationships among environmental exposure, genetics and health. It will also develop a bench-top assay unit that will perform colorimetric assays for endotoxin on the collected samples. The sampler will employ an array of novel micro-channel collectors, and, when combined with a position-monitor (GPS) and activity monitor (accelerometer), will collect a time-series of exposure samples that will be time- and location- stamped to allow researchers to fully characterize the exposure history of subjects as they travel through their environment. The sampling unit will be extremely small, light-weight and battery operated to allow it to be carried in a back-pack even by a 10-year old child. This device will significantly improve the ability to localize exposure events in space and time and will provide a critical tool for use in resolving uncertainties about the relationships between exposure and human health impacts. Each sampling unit will contain a carousel holding an array of micro-channel collectors which will collect samples at 30 minute (or shorter) intervals. The carousel will hold up to 48 collectors allowing samples to be collected over a 24 hour period. Once all the samples have been collected, the carousel will be transferred to the bench-top assay unit which willperform assays on all of the collected samples, greatly reducing the workload associated with the analysis of the numerous samples collected during a typical epidemiological study. This aerosol sampling and detection apparatus will be integrated with automation technology developed by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) to produce a self-contained portable personal exposure sampling unit and a bench-top assay unit. Enertechnix will be responsible for the aerosol sampling and microfluidic components and for system integration. PNNL will adapt its automation, power management, and position- and motion- sensing technologies for use in the PEM. The University of Washington (UW) will assist in the implementation of an endotoxin assay employing a miniature colorimetric readout unit developed by FAR Sciences. Prototypes will be developed and, in collaboration with the UW, will be field tested in a variety of environments to demonstrate the performance of the sampler and bench-top assay unit.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The principal objective for this SBIR Phase II Competitive Renewal project is to demonstrate clinical relevance of a unique Adaptive Optics Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscope (AOSLO) that the project team designed and builtin Phase I and Phase II work. It features closed-loop AO control that automatically compensates for aberrations of the eye, yielding nearly diffraction-limited confocal retinal images. This is particularly useful in retinal imaging, since the difference inresolvable feature size with AO (~2 m) and without AO (~10 m) corresponds to a range that includes the size of many of the retina&#039;s most important features: cone photoreceptors, nerve fiber cells, erythrocytes, leukocytes, capillaries, and retinal pigmentepithelial cells. As a result, the AOSLO should lead to a better understanding of retinal function and disease. The prototype AOSLO incorporates an optical doubler and custom-developed long-stroke deformable mirror for compensating higher order aberrations. Those unique components allow aberration- compensated imaging suitable for 90% of clinical subjects without the use of added trial lenses. In Phase II work, the AOSLO was demonstrated to achieve exceptional retinal image resolution and operational characteristics that make it well suited for clinical use. It uses long wavelength and low intensit source illumination, so that many subjects can be imaged without pupil dilation. It also includes a beam steering system that allows a clinician to translate theimaged field across the retina without requiring continual subject refixations. Innovative imaging techniques that will be explored in the clinical settings using this AOSLO platform technology include individual blood cell tracking, hemodynamic imaging,and montage mapping of photoreceptors. The project will include development of clinically inspired enhancements in imaging, ergonomics, and software control of the prototype AOSLO. BMC will collaborate with a clinical site in an evaluation of the clinicalusefulness of the AOSLO. Observational pilot studies will be conducted at Beetham Eye Institute (BEI) of the Joslin Diabetes Center Clinical aims for the BEI study will be to evaluate the capability of AOSLO retinal images to serve as a clinically useful surrogates for visual acuity  in eyes with center-involved diabetic macular edema, and to evaluate correlations between quantified AOSLO image metrics and the state of retinal disease in diabetic retinopathy.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this Phase II competitive renewal project is to implement a clinical study to collect data to validate EyeStar(tm), a software system  as the basis for comprehensive telescreening for all stages of diabetic retinopathy (DR). According to the CDC, approximately 80 million people in the U.S. have some form of eye disease, including 20 million diabetics at risk for retinopathy. It is estimated that less than hal of those individuals with diabetes are screened periodically for DR. Lack of medical coverage and access to healthcare providers imposes major obstacles for nearly 10 million diabetics. Creating an affordable and accessible solution to providing screening services to these diabetics presents a significant challenge to the healthcare community. The objective of the original Phase II grant was to demonstrate a   top-down   screening algorithm for triaging normal, i.e. no disease, from suspect retinas using a new technique, amplitude modulation-frequencymodulation (AM-FM), to analyze multi-field digital retinal images. As a result of the Phase II grant, the EyeStar(tm) software for diabetic retinopathy screening was developed. In this project, we will perform a clinical validation that will allow us to apply for 510(k) clearance by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). To meet this goal, we have divided this proposal in three aims. In Aim #1, we will establish a clinical network and meet the requirements for the number of cases needed to perform a clinical study in order to obtain FDA clearance for our integrated, automatic screening system. In Aim #2, we will perform an independent validation for purposes of submitting to the FDA a 510(k) clearance application. In Aim #3, we will operate all the EyeStar(tm) components in a near   real-time   environment.     This project is significant for two main reasons: increase of productivity and safety testing. Firs, by increasing the productivity of DR screening centers through automation, a much larger population of at-risk individuals will have access to this service, leading to improved productivit and quality of life through early detection and treatment. Second, by providing to the FDA a system that is highly effective and sensitive, we will insure that the safety requirements of semi-automatic screening for diabetic retinopathy are met.     The FDA-cleared software will be integrated into our existing network of retinal screening sites in Texas and New Mexico as the first step toward commercialization.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: According to the CDC, there are over 25 million diabetics in the United States, of which less than 50% get their recommended yearly eye exams. This has resulted in an increase of the incidence of diabetic retinopathy, making itthe second leading cause of blindness. Our proposed DR screening system, EyeStar(tm), would allow for an increase in examinations available to millions of Americans at risk, without major impact on our healthcare system. The proposed project will perform the necessary clinical validation of the system for FDA approval..",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): According to the World Health Organization (WHO) global eye disease survey, 14 million people are blind or severely visually impaired due to age-related macular degeneration AMD. This disease affects the central visionof adults over the age 65. Degenerative changes of the Bruch&#039;s membrane and the retinal pigment epithelium in the macula (central retina) in addition to the partial / complete vision loss is the hallmark of AMD. It is estimated that greater than 25% of AMDpatients will develop severe vision loss due to either geographic atrophy or Choroidal NeoVascularization (CNV), commonly known as wet AMD. CNV development derives from both inflammation and angiogenesis. Thus, both VEGF and inflammatory mediators must becontrolled to prevent CNV associated vision loss. Elevated levels of VEGF have been found in pathological neovascularization. The process of angiogenesis is multi-factorial and highly complex with evidence of both neovascularization and inflammation. VEGFis considered important in both physiological and pathological situations. By blocking all VEGF, local wound healing could be impaired, whereas for any ocular surgery treatment the procedure may then be postponed or even stopped altogether. Both neovascularization and inflammation must be controlled in order to achieve the desired benefit in Wet AMD. A strategy to prevent the formation of VEGF and inflammatory mediators, as opposed to just blocking each of them individually, could be important in halting the progression of the disease. To implement this strategy, NovelMed has developed a high affinity highly selective neutralizing antibody of the alternative pathway that prevents complement and cellular activation and production of inflammatory mediators. In a rabbit model of choroidal neovascularization (CNV), the drug prevented the formation of CNV lesions at a concentration of 15 ug per eye over a 28 day period. We would like to develop The Specific Aims of the project are: 1) Production and Purificationof Humanized NM9405 for Aims 2 and 3; 2) Evaluation of Humanized NM9405 in the Rabbit Model of Choroidal NeoVascularization (CNV) and 3) Efficacy and Safety of the Humanized NM9405 in the Cynomolgus Monkey Model of Choroidal Neovascularization (CNV)- - These studies will address ocular efficacy and toxicity studies required for moving to the next step of Investigational New Drug (IND) filings, pharma-partnering, and investment. The demonstration of efficacy and preliminary ocular safety will move this program to an IND stage application.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) affects nearly 14 million people in the U.S as documented by the World Health Organization. Recently, anti-VEGF therapy was approved only for the treatment of Wet AMD. Both neovascularization and inflammation are associated with Wet AMD. The current treatments are effective only in preventing the formation of new blood vessels without inhibiting underlying inflammation. NovelMed neutralizing antibody inhibits both; neovascularization as well as inflammation. The treatment could affect both the Dry and the Wet AMD; however, in this proposal we are addressing only Wet AMD based on the recommendation of the review panel.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Some of the most useful tools for diagnosis and understanding of blinding retinal diseases rely on the use of spectral reflectance. Improvements to these tools, especially over the past decade, have greatly advanced ourability to achieve extremely high-resolution images of the human retina. In particular, scanning laser ophthalmoscopy has proven to be an important technique for studies of microperimetry, psychophysics and visual neuroscience by imaging the cone mosaic while simultaneously delivering stimuli to single cones. Due to the unprecedented resolution now achieved during retinal imaging, there is an increasing need for using longer wavelength light that can penetrate deeper into tissue and is invisible or imperceptible to the human eyes. Bounded by human eye response and increased optical absorption, the use of wavelengths between 900 and 1100 nm is the most suitable solution. Unfortunately, while there are several vendors providing decent light sources across this wavelength range there are no suitable photodetectors. Therefore, the goal of this proposed research effort is to develop an avalanche photodiode (APD) module with exceptional response from the visible to 1050 nm that will be compatible with establishedscanning laser ophthalmoscopes. Our proposed solution uses our APD&#039;s high responsivity to near-infrared radiation to develop a receiver module useful for ophthalmoscopy and other health sciences. In Phase I, we successfully demonstrated the feasibility ofthe approach by assembling a custom near-infrared enhanced receiver APD module including wide amplification electronics providing a high gain bandwidth of gt 40 Mhz. This receiver was then used in an adaptive optics SLO (AOSLO) at the University of Alabama, Birmingham. Through its use, images of a living retina were recorded with a tunable laser source from 600 to 1070 nm. This was the first time such images were realized with a signal receiver. During Phase II, we will address the reliability, manufacturing, packaging and commercial concerns of the receiver module. In addition, our research collaborators will continue to use the receiver as it evolves to enable a range of important clinical studies on the living human retina. These studies will include important 3D imaging on of photoreceptor cells, multi-channel sampling, and the acquisition of retinal images with illumination wavelengths longer than presently applied. This information will be used in their studies to better understand the pathogenesis of Pathological Myopia.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Radiation Monitoring Devices, Inc. proposes to develop a receiver module with response to near-infrared radiation that is significantly higher than any currently available product. This module will promote new retinal imaging technologies and let specialist utilize established diagnostic imaging instruments in a much more effective manner. As part of the proposed effort, the module will be utilized to help predict the onset of pathological myopia, a common retinal disease affecting millions of people worldwide.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Demodex mites are microscopic ectoparasites that commonly infest the pilosebaceous unit of the skin. Uncontrolled overgrowth of mites has been implicated in causing papulopustular lesions in the skin, rosacea in the face, and blepharitis in the eye. Blepharitis (lid margin inflammation) associated with mite-harboring cylindrical dandruff in eyelashes is one of the most common eye diseases. The conventional treatment, using lid scrub with Baby Shampoo, is ineffective in eradicating ocular Demodex infestation (demodicosis). However, we have discovered that tea tree oil (TTO), a natural essential oil steam-distilled from the leaf of Melaleuca alternifolia, is effective in treating ocular demodicosi. Our preliminary clinicalstudies showed that the lid scrub regimen, based on a weekly office scrub with 50% TTO followed by daily home scrubs with tea tree shampoo, is effective in resolving irritating symptoms and ocular surface inflammation, as well as in improving vision in a number of patients. However, this treatment was not convenient for patient self-administration and resulted in ocular irritation in some patients. We have completed the following three Aims described in Phase I application to identify the most active ingredient in TTO responsible for killing Demodex mites and to eliminate the remaining ingredients in order to develop single-use Cliradex(R) Pads to facilitate the patient&#039;s ease of self- administration (Aim 1), to complete preclinical safety studies to verifythat this new Cliradex(R) Pad was non- irritative based on an in vitro cytotoxic assay and 9 Repeated Insult Patch Test in human subjects (Aim 2), and to demonstrate that the new formulation exerts potent anti-microbial effects, thus eliminating the need to add preservatives, and is stable both in the glass jar and in the packette (Aim 3). In this  Phase II application, we propose to conduct randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trials to  demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the single-use Cliradex(R) Pad compared to the Placebo Pad for treating ocular demodicosis. In Aim 1, at a single site, we will determine the optimal regimen for applying Cliradex(R) Pads to achieve maximal reduction in ocular Demodex counts and clinical improvement in patients&#039; symptoms and signs without eliciting adverse events by comparing three different lid scrub regimens for a period of 1 month. In Aim 2, at multiple sites, we will use the lid scrub regimen optimized in Aim 1 to determine the optimal duration to achieve maximal reduction of ocular Demodex counts and maximal efficacy in resolving patient&#039;s inflammatory symptoms and signs. Accomplishment of these two Aims will allow us to gather data for Phase III FDA pivotal studies so that an NDA can be submitted to for the ultimate goal of developing the first FDA-approved prescription ophthalmic therapy containing the most active ingredient of TTO to eradicate ocular demodicosis.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our proposed randomized, double-blind, controlled clinicaltrials described in this Phase II application aim to demonstrate the clinical safety and efficacy o single-use Cliradex(R) Pads that contain the most active ingredient identified during the Phase I grant from tea tree oil to eradicate ocular demodicosis. During Phase I, we have gathered strong data supporting that the new formulation also exerts unique broad-spectrum anti- microbial effects, thus eliminating the need for adding preservatives. Furthermore, we have verified that this new formulation is not irritative based on an in vitro cytotoxic assay and 9 Repeated Insult Patch Test in human subjects, and the new formulation is stable both in the glass jar and in the packette. Hence, our accomplishments during Phase I justifies our further pursuit of the two Aims described herein so that we may eventually develop a new safe, effective, and convenient treatment for eradicating ocular demodicosis, which is one of the most common causes of blepharitis that has plagued patients with ocular irritation, especiallyin our aging population.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     There are nearly 24 million people in the U.S. who suffer from diabetes and all are at risk for developing diabetic macular edema (DME), a vision-threatening retinal complication of diabetes that is the leading cause of blindness in working age adults. Current prevalence of DME in the U.S. is estimated to be between 1.2 - 2.1 million. Increased retinal vascular permeability (RVP) to plasma proteins and fluid, resulting from breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier, leads to a build-up of fluid in the central portion of the retina - the macula - and the development of DME. The serine protease plasma kallikrein (PK) has been recently implicated as a pathological mediator of increased RVP in diabetes. In work carried out in phase I and phase II, ActiveSite has developed novel potent and selective PK inhibitors that reduce pathological RVP induced in clinically relevant rodent models of hypertension and diabetes following systemic, non-ocular administration. Based on efficacy and safety studies carried out in phase II, a lead PK inhibitor has been identified that has been shown to be effective in lowering pathological RVP following daily oral dosing at a moderate daily dose level. Repeat-dose range-finding toxicology studiesin rats with the lead compound resulted in dose- proportional drug exposure, and, importantly, did not result in detectable adverse effects on any parameter at the highest dose tested, a dose that resulted in daily exposure to the active compound gt40-foldhigher than that seen at the efficacious dose, predictive of a high therapeutic index in the clinic. Based on the efficacy and preliminary safety assessments, the specific aims of this competitive phase II renewal application are to carry out FDA-requiredsafety and toxicology studies with the lead PK inhibitor, studies that once completed successfully, would allow for the compilation and filing of an IND application with the FDA for initiating first-in-human Phase I clinical trials for oral treatment forDME.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     This phase II project proposes that inhibition of the serine protease plasma kallikrein (PK), would have significant therapeutic impact in reducing diabetic macular edema (DME), the major vision-threatening complication of diabetes.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Glaucoma drainage devices (GDDs) have widely been used in the treatment of high-risk refractory glaucoma. To avoid tube exposure, which may lead to serious eye infection, the implanted GDD tube must be covered by apatch graft traditionally made of either donor sclera or pericardium. However, these patch grafts still carry a high rate of progressive thinning and erosion, a complication that we speculate results from the lack of cellular infiltration from the surrounding host conjunctival stroma and poor integration of these patch grafts to the host tissue. We further speculate that a thicker version of cryopreserved amniotic membrane (AM), manufactured by Bio-Tissue, Inc., a 100%-owned subsidiary of TissueTech, Inc.,could offer better tensile strength, be suitable for tectonic support, and have biological activities to promote cellular infiltration by the surrounding host conjunctival stroma, thus reducing progressive allogeneic patch graft thinning/erosion.  ThroughSBIR Phase I grant support (R43 EY19785), we have evaluated the thicker AM as an alternative patch graft for covering the GDD tube during the primary implantation. We further monitored the host cell interaction using anterior segment optical coherence tomography (OCT). We have successfully accomplished the proposed aims of the above studies which demonstrated the short-term stability/efficacy of AM in covering the tube in primary GDD surgery (Phase I- Aim 1), and confirmed the feasibility of using OCT to distinguish host cell infiltration into the AM after transplantation over the GDD tube (Phase I- Aim 2).  In this Phase II application, we propose to conduct a prospective, controlled study to compare the long-term safety and efficacy of the thicker AM (AmnioGuard  , Bio-Tissue, Inc, Miami, FL) to the pericardium (Tutoplast(R), IOP Inc, Costa Mesa, CA) in securing the GDD tube and reducing tube exposure and graft thinning in patients with high risk glaucoma. We will also study the risk factors that may contribute to GDD tube exposure. Accomplishment of this Phase II study will position AM as an effective alternative to the existing patch grafts to reduce tube exposure and enhance the success of GDD implantation while providing a better aesthetic appearance andallowing visualization of the tube in patients with high risk glaucoma. This will also allow the Company to expand its market space from ocular surface to glaucoma diseases. We speculate that such a graft might also have other clinical applications outside of covering GDD tubes.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     Our proposed prospective, randomized and comparative study described in this Phase II application aims to demonstrate the clinical safety and efficacy of transplanting a thicker version of amniotic membrane (AM) as an alternative tectonic substrate to cover glaucoma drainage device (GDD) tubes. Through SBIR Phase I grant support (EY019785), we found that this thicker AM offers superior tectonic support and biological activity to promote integration by the host conjunctival stromal cells, thus reducing patch graft thinning/erosion. The completion of the study described herein will allow eye surgeons to adopt this new AM graft to improve surgical outcomes and prevent complications in GDD surgery forhigh risk glaucoma patients. This will also allow the Company to expand its market space and provide services to glaucoma indications.",

Broad access to low-cost visual intelligence technologies developed in this project will improve the independence and capabilities of the visually impaired. There has been tremendous technological progress in computer vision and in the computational power and network bandwidth of and Smartphone platforms. The synergy of these advances stands to revolutionize the way people find information and interact with the physical world. However, these technologies arenot yet fully in the hands of the visually impaired, arguably the population that could benefit the most from these developments. Part of the barrier to progress in this area has been that computer vision can accurately handle only a small fraction of thetypical images coming from a cell phone camera. To cope with these limitations and make any-image recognition possible, IQ Engines will develop a hybrid system that uses both computer vision and crowdsourcing: if the computer algorithms are not able to understand an image, then the image is sent to a unique crowdsourcing network of people for image analysis. The proposed research includes specific aims to both develop advanced computer vision algorithms for object recognition and advanced crowdsourced networks optimized to the needs of the visually impaired community. This approach combines the speed and accuracy of computer vision with the robustness and understanding of human vision, ultimately providing the user fast and accurate information about the content of any image.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     The image recognition technology developed in this application will enable the visually impaired to access visual information using a mobile phone camera, a device most people already have.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposed project is motivated by the fact that comprehensive, broad-scale screening for eye diseases such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), glaucoma, and diabetic retinopathy (DR), including advanced stages, is economically prohibitive without the introduction of computer-assisted diagnosis of retinal images. According to the CDC approximately 80 million people in the U.S. have some form of eye disease, including 20 million diabetics at risk for retinopathy, 60 million at risk for glaucoma, and 13 million diagnosed with AMD. It is estimated that less than half of those individuals with diabetes are screened periodically for DR. Lack of medical coverage and access to healthcare providers imposes major obstacles for nearly 10 million diabetics. Creating an affordable and accessible solution to providing screening services to these diabetics presents a significant challenge to the healthcare community. A comprehensive screening program for U.S. citizens utilizing ophthalmologists, optometrists, or other trained specialists, readers, to grade each case would be prohibitively expensive. The solution is to implement a computer-assisted technology similar to other medical applications, such as mammograms and Pap smears; that would provide comprehensive, periodic screening of our at-risk population. Our business models show a 400% decrease in costs with the integration of automation into today manual screening methods. The study will be made possible through the implementation of the infrastructure for a reading center in South Texas where it is estimated that nearly 200,000 diabetics reside and over 50% do not receive annual examinations. The center will be a demonstration site where the efficacy of the software can bedocumented for submission to the FDA for pre-market approval (PMA). The goal is to show that a center&#039;s through put number of cases screened per time period will increase fivefold through the use of a hybrid (automation-human graders) approach with sensitivity that is comparable or better than solely human-based screening. The significance of this proposed research is two-fold. First, by increasing the productivity of reading centers through automation, a much larger population of at-risk individuals willhave access to this service, leading to improved productivity and quality of life through early detection and treatment. Second, by providing to the FDA, a system that is highly effective and sensitive to advanced disease, the issue of safety is essentially eliminated.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Today, the CDC reports that there are about 80 million people in the US who have some form of eye disease. Diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, and glaucoma are the leading causes of blindness. There is some form of intervention for each of these eye diseases that can result in the extension of useful vision, if detected early. Our automated eye disease screening system will make examination available to millions of Americans at risk for eye disease available without major impact on our healthcare system. This is possible only through automation as an adjunct to examinations by eye care specialists.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This SBIR application will revolutionize the methodology for routine examination of the back of the eye by developing an easy-to-use, pocket-sized, inexpensive digital camera for documenting retinal and optic nerve diseases. In order to reduce rates of preventable vision loss, the early diagnosis of treatable eye diseases has become increasingly important, especially as the global population ages. Early disease diagnosis is vital to preserving retinal and optic nerve function. The widely available direct ophthalmoscope is used routinely but only with difficulty. It has a small field of view, provides a  fleeting image and leaves no examination record. Although ground-breaking when it was invented in the mid-19th century,this instrument is no longer a cutting edge tool in global effort to reduce vision loss. Traditional fundus cameras are a valuable technology, but they are expensive and bulky, and are typically used by trained technicians in well funded eye care centers.As a result, a lack of a quality retinal examination puts many people at risk for vision loss. Housed in a small ergonomic design, the new camera drastically simplifies fundus imaging. Quality photographs are obtained by bringing the smooth front tip of the camera into brief contact with a patient&#039;s anesthetized cornea. Image acquisition and analysis is performed automatically upon contact, and an audible signal informs the examiner the process is complete. The images are saved internally and can be wirelessly transmitted to a nearby computer for visualization and archival storage. Once the end user realizes the value of this product, concerns regarding corneal contact will dissipate, and this new camera will replace the direct ophthalmoscope with 21st century technology. This Phase II program is aimed at developing optical, mechanical, electronic and image analysis aspects of the camera, which must conform to a number of demanding performance and miniaturization specifications. The outcome of this project will be several clinically tested commercial prototypes, which can be exhibited to potential investors and customers, such as large ophthalmic companies or end users. It will serve as the basis in Phase III for high-volume manufacturing process development,registration studies, and launch.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed ultra-portable hand-held wireless fundus camera provides an effective and simple approach to inspecting the human retina and documenting the findings. It replaces the direct ophthalmoscope as a more reliable and advanced medical device. The images can be collected during routine visits to primary care providers or specialists and in other high volume settings thereby reducing rates of vision loss and lowering health care costs,and improving the quality of life for millions of people.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this phase II project is to use a new and innovative sensor technology called Doppler velocimetery (DV) for solving the problem of wayfinding indoors for the vision impaired. By performing a Doppler measurement of the floor movement relative to the walking person it is possible to determine the along-track velocity, the cross-track velocity and the vertical (up or down) velocity. With these measurements it is possible to accurately calculate real-time position inside a building relative to a starting point t an entrance. The significant innovation in this technology over other indoor navigation solutions for the vision impaired is that it does not require the installation of expensive infrastructure wihina building to provide wayfinding. Wayfinding through an unfamiliar building for persons who are blind or have low vision is a challenging task. The ability of a person to move freely within publi and commercial buildings is an important factor for integration and independence of these individuals within educational institutions, work and social environments. This proposed technology has the potential of making a major impact by providing a practical indoor wayfinding solution for the vision impaired.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Current estimates suggest that there are 12 million people in the U.S who have some form of uncorrected vision impairment, with approximately 3.4 million having low vision or legal blindness. Because of demographic trends, particularly the aging of the American population, these studies project a doubling of these numbers by 2030.

The successful completion of this project will yield a new braille and tactile graphics embosser that utilizes a polymer roller based embossing system and prints full colorink on cut sheet paper up to A3/tabloid size. This new embosser will allow embossing anywhere on a page, permitting braille that meets specific national standards and smoother, more continuous graphics to be created together on the same page with full color print. The development of the new embosser will begin with finalization of the polymer roller design, if this is not accomplished prior to the end of the Phase I research, and selection of metal punch pins sized and shaped to produce the best quality dots. Next the embosser hardware and electronics will be developed, followed by the firmware and drivers necessary to control the hardware to emboss graphics and braille where desired along the smooth surface of the polymer roller. After this development is complete, braille translation and graphics editing software will be optimized for the new embossing system. The technical advancements implemented in the new embosser will improve and speed up access to graphical information by the visually impaired, providing a great benefit, especially to those studying or working in technical fields such as science, mathematics and engineering. The new embosser utilizing the polymer roller based embossing system will also be up to 20% cheaper to manufacture than a similarmodel based on the current technology, permitting better embossers to be sold at a lower price, allowing more customers to purchase them. This will lead to more people with visual impairments getting better access to tactile materials they need for education, in their professions and in their daily lives, which certainly has the potential to improve their mental health and quality of life.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Autologous stem cells and growth factors provide valuable therapies for a variety of indications. When stem cells and growth factors are co-delivered, they produce a greater therapeutic effect than delivery of either stem cells or growth factors alone. However, the use of growth factors in the clinic is limited by the challenges of retaining the proteins at the site of healing. The use of stem cells is challenging because of the low frequency of cells in autologous tissue. To address these difficulties, Affinergy used its core technology, phage display biopanning, to screen phage libraries containing billions of candidate peptide sequences. From this process, we identified peptides that bind with high affinity and specificity to growth factors and stem cells. In our Phase II project, we developed a biomaterial coated with a growth factor-binding peptide that captures and retains growth factors significantly longer than the commercially available biomaterials. We demonstrated in animal models that this biomaterial has greater therapeutic efficacy than commercially available products when combined with autologous tissue containing the target growth factor. In this Competing Renewal application, we propose to further enhancethe efficacy of this product through the addition of a stem cell-binding peptide, also identified by phage display. The combination of the two peptides will increase the capture of stem cells from autologous tissue onto the material and provide a synergistic effect with the capture and retention of growth factors.

Advanced features that will be incorporated into the genetically modified tissue engineered in vitro human models will include: 1) gene activity reporter functions for monitoring the activity of various cel signaling pathways of toxicological, immunological or developmental significance; and 2) genetically modified tissue engineered in vitro human models with knockdown or over-expression of specific genetic functions.  During the Phase I project, the feasibility of producing  these models was established by development of organotypic skin and airway models with reporter functions for monitoring activity of NF B and Nrf2 transcription factors (TFs). These TFs are involved in inflammatory and antioxidant response signalingpathways, respectively. Induction of reporter activity was evaluated qualitatively by epifluorescence microscopy of green fluorescent protein (GFP), and quantitatively by measurement of luciferase activity in tissue extracts. Significant progress was alsomade in development of gene knockdown models. Epidermal cells were genetically modified to allow inducible knockdown of interleukin-1 IL-1 , a cytokine that plays an important role in epithelial inflammation, wound healing and disease states induced by environmental agents. Knockdown of IL-1 gene and protein expression of 72 % was achieved. Incorporation of these cells into organotypic models and further functional testing is in progress.  A panel of 14 organotypic skin and airway epithelial TF reporter models for monitoring activity of cell signaling pathways of toxicological, immunological or developmental significance will be produced during the Phase II project. The models will be assembled into commercial products consisting of various combinations andconfigurations including high throughput 96-well formats, and validated with a comprehensive set of reference chemicals. These models will allow mechanistic toxicological evaluation of industrial chemicals, consumer product ingredients or environmental agents. The commercial models are intended for use by chemical producers, consumer product and cosmetic manufacturers, pharmaceutical companies, as well as industrial, governmental and academic environmental toxicologists and pharmaceutical researchers.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The organotypic in vitro human models produced by the project will allow mechanistic toxicological evaluation of industrial chemicals, consumer product ingredients or environmental agents for the protection of public health.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): At the frontier of biological electron microscopy, there is a strong emphasis on imaging the 3-D structure of cells, organelles, and macromolecules in their   native   state. This is facilitated by the use of frozen-hydrated specimens which have not been subjected to chemical fixation, dehydration or stains. The resolution is currently limited to about 4 nm by electron irradiation damage. The use of in-focus phase contrast imaging in the transmission electron microscope(TEM) - accomplished by incorporating a phase plate in the back focal plane of the objective lens - can increase resolution in electron tomography, and also increase throughput. Although these improvements have recently been confirmed by preliminary experiments, and the benefits of phase plates have been known for decades, technical difficulties have always inhibited their use. The three main difficulties are: keeping the phase plate centered on the electron optical axis, avoiding contamination and allowingeasy phase plate replacement in the microscope. In Phase I we have developed and tested a working prototype of a phase plate holder with precision positioning system, a heater and an electrical feed-through for use with electrostatic phase plates. Exchanging the original objective aperture holder of the TEM with the phase plate holder allows nearly any cryo-EM to be equipped with a phase plate. The cost of this holder is substantially lower than any other technology that can yield a similar improvement inimaging of frozen- hydrated specimens. In Phase II we will refine this concept into a commercial product and add auto-centering software as well as a load-lock to the holder, allowing replacement of the phase plates without breaking the vacuum in the microscope column. This latter addition will eliminate the need to break the vacuum to insert the phase plate, and makes this product into a complete solution to all technical issues that have traditionally prevented scientists from more routinely using this characterization technique.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Phase plate holder for transmission electron microscopy Relevance The phase plate holder that will be developed and commercialized in this project allows routine transmission electron microscopy characterization of biological structures at unprecedented resolution and contrast levels. The routine use of phase plates will allow the acquisition of levels of details in 3D tomographic images of non-crystalline materials to increase by a large leap. This TEM imaging ability is used to gain a comprehensive understanding of cellular structures and allows direct correlation between structure and function.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Directed protein evolution is a powerful technology for protein engineering. It generally involves generating a library of protein variants and identifying those with desired properties by selection or screening. In terms of library complexity, in vitro selection methods are superior to cell-based selection methods by several orders of magnitude, allowing a much larger sequence space in proteins to be sampled. There is currently no effective in vitro method to select proteins with desired mutations that enhance their thermostability. Thermostable proteins can function at high temperatures, are generally robust and resistant to degradation under a variety of conditions, and therefore are valuable for a wide range of industrial and medical applications. This project intends to develop a technology for in vitro selection of protein thermostability. We plan to achieve this goal by (1) constructing a reconstituted in vitro protein synthesis system (thermo PURE system) using purified components from Thermus thermophilus, a bacterium that grows at an optimal temperature of 720C, and (2) applying such system for directed evolution of proteins with enhanced thermostability.  We have successfully completed the first phase of the project (Phase I) and established an initial thermo PURE system that allowed in vitro synthesis of active full- length proteins at temperatures up to 600C. For the Phase II, we propose to commercialize the thermo PURE system by optimizing the system and testing more target proteins. We also propose to use the thermo PURE system in conjunction with in vitro selection technologies, such as in vitro compartmentalization and ribosome display, for directed evolution of thermostable proteins from their mesophilic origins. We plan to test several selection schemes of directed evolution for a variety of enzymes and proteins. If successful, this project would lead to the following unique and valuable commercial products: (1) a protein thermo synthesis kit; (2) a servicefor engineering proteins with enhanced thermostability; (3) thermostable nucleic acid enzymes as new reagents for research communities and thermostable single-chain antibodies for therapeutic applications.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     The overall objective of this study is to develop a novel in vitro microfluidic platform to test a drug or delivery vehicle&#039;s ability to permeate the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB). In contrast to current in-vitro models, our proposed device, SIM-BBB, comprises of a microfluidic two-compartment chamber. The chamber is designed in such a way as to permit visualization-friendly evaluation of transport/permeation under appropriate microcirculatory size and flow conditions, while simultaneously simplifying device fabrication. The apical side is seeded with endothelial cells and the basolateral side supports glial cell co-cultures. The increased physiological realism substantially improves BBB characteristics including formation of tight junctions and expression of relevant transporters. The new platform offers greater throughput, increased library coverage, lower cost, rapid turnaround times and increased mechanistic knowledge benefiting drug discovery efforts. In Phase I, thefirst generation microfluidic SIM-BBB device was designed and fabricated using soft lithography. Brain endothelial cells were cultured in the microfluidic constructs with a perfusate of astrocyte conditioned media. Biochemical analysis showed upregulationof tight junction molecules while optical analysis showed intactness of the BBB in the microfluidic device. Finally, transporters assay was successfully demonstrated in the device. Phase II efforts will focus on optimization of the microfluidic device forenhanced physiological fidelity. Electrodes will be integrated for non-visual monitoring of the endothelial cell layers and tight junction formation via trans-endothelial electrical resistance (TEER) measurements. Finally, the developed technology will bedemonstrated for diverse applications including drug penetration studies and leukocyte migration under inflammatory conditions. A multi-disciplinary partnership with expertise in engineering and biology has been assembled for successful completion of the project.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     The project seeks to develop an in vitro screening model for screening the potential of drug candidates to cross the BBB and subsequently cause therapeutic or toxic effects. By providing accurate and predictive data, the model will reduce the need for animal models and promises to both reduce late stage drug candidate failures and accelerate central nervous system (CNS) therapeutic development. The product will be commercialized to pharmaceutical firms, drug research labs and universities/non-profit centers engaged in novel neurological therapeutics research and CNS toxicity. Equally important, it is also expected to spur basic research, where it can be used to study the biological mechanisms of BBB (dys) function.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The significance of this project is the development of a novel photoactivated collagen dressing with demonstrated bactericidal effects, minimal toxic effects and low susceptibility to mechanisms of microbial resistancein an effort to ultimately expand the armamentarium of antimicrobial agents for the management of wound infections. Approximately 2 million patients develop hospital-acquired (nosocomial) infections with surgical wound infections being the most common. Ithas been reported that 1 of every 24 (4.1%) patients who have inpatient surgery in the US develops a wound infection. These infections are substantial in terms of their impact on morbidity, mortality and resource use. As many as 100,000 deaths and staggering costs of  3.5B annually are associated with wound infections. In the US wound infections increase costs of hospitalization by more than  3,000/patient. While the conventional treatment of infections includes both focused and broad-spectrum antibiotics there has been a continuing and alarming trend of microbial resistance to these agents. This resistance is believed to occur as a result of chromosomal mutation, inductive expression of a latent chromosomal genes or exchange of genetic material via transformation, bacteriophage transduction, or plasmid conjugation. In-vitro and in-vivo experiments were successfully performed during Phase I. It was demonstrated that the light activated dressings significantly inhibits bacterial growth in-vitro, including biofilm scenarios. In addition, the effect is robust,  reducing bacterial loads in-vivo in infected incision, wound abscess and pressure ulcer models. Similar results were obtained for Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli infections. The current proposal specifically aims to further refine the use of photoactivated antimicrobial collagen technology as a wound treatment to augment wound closure and healing, thereby reducing the incidence of acute and chronic wound infections.The studies performed will provide important preclinical results designed to optimize materials for human clinical studies and FDA approval.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Millions of surgical and iatrogenic wounds occur on an annual basis. Each requires appropriate management to facilitate healing, reduce the potential for infection and minimize disability and scarring. Wound infection and related complications increase the cost of care by nearly  9000 per occurrence and prolong hospital stays. At the same time, bacterial resistance to antibiotics is increasing at an alarming rate, with community acquired MRSA (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) prevalence approaching 50% in several communities based on wound culture data. This project aims todevelop a novel strategy using a combination of visible light and redox-active chromophores to expand the armamentarium of antimicrobial agents for the management of surgical wounds.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ion channels are membrane proteins that allow the selective movement of charged molecules through cellular membranes. Many disease states, such as cystic fibrosis, muscular dystrophies, hypertension, and cardiac arrhythmias are caused by ion channel pathologies. Ion channels have been identified by the drug discovery industry as excellent targets for therapeutic intervention but because of the technical hurdles involved in developing quality, high- throughput functionalion channel assays, the development of   ion channel drugs   has been disappointing. Photoswitch Biosciences has developed technology, which allows attaching small nanomachines to ion channels enabling rapid and reversible control of these proteins by light. The Specific Aims of this proposed Phase II SBIR project are: (1) generation of several stable cell lines expressing photoswitched ion channels, accessory channels, and test channels; (2) produce three functional prototype instruments for sale to earlyaccess collaborators. As part of Specific Aim 2 we will evaluate illumination and detection strategies and implement the most appropriate. The first commercial products to be developed will be all-optical ion channel assays and instruments for high- throughput ion channel drug discovery. The use of all-optical technology for ion channel assays has several advantages over existing techniques: (1) Elimination of liquid additions for channel activation, (2) Highly scalabl for high-throughput ion channel drug discovery, (3) Price per datapoint is at least 100X less than automated electrophysiology, (4) Channel activation is almost 100X faster than KCl addition. The most important benefit of this new ion channel assay technology is the ability to rapidly and reliably control membrane potential. This control of membrane potential allows for the development of scalable high-throughput state-dependent assays, which is impossible with current technology. This breakthrough technology will finally allow the full exploitation of ion channels as drug targets.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:      Many diseases involve problems with the functioning of membrane proteins called ion channels. These proteins are responsible for proper operation of the nervous system, the muscles, and virtually all other physiological events. Drugs that affect ion channel behavior have been developed for a variety of diseases, including heart problems, cystic fibrosis, and other diseases. Ion channels are difficult to study and, because of this,drugs directed at ion channels have been difficult to find. Photoswitch Biosciences proposes to develop methods to increase the ability to study ion channels, and, thus, to increase the number of ion channel drugs.",

IVS generated revenues from the sales of three-dimensional (3D) cell culture tools (MC-8TM and IVS InsertsTM) thatcan grow various hydrogel tissues without any support layers. The culture tools enable Palpator TM and Tissue StretcherTM to stretch the hydrogel tissues for biomechanical measurements and mechanical conditioning (e.g., cyclic stress applications), respectively. IVS also performed contract research services, using our tools and devices, for industry and academic laboratories for profiling compound-induced effects on cell and tissue physiology. To further demonstrate our ability to screen drug candidates, especially for drug developers, the market demands benchmark studies against compounds and drugs whose pharmacological functions, including toxicity information, have been well-characterized. To fully commercialize our current start- up activities, IVS willimprove its rapid drug screening system that uses engineered heart tissues (EHTs) to monitor the effects of test compounds on cardiac contractility and associated regulatory molecules. In Aim 1, EHTs will be developed using cardiomyocytes derived from human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells to commercialize a drug screening system using human samples. Using this system, we will determine the beneficial and toxic effects of a panel of drugs, based on the drug-induced changes in the cardiac functions of EHTs, as well as the signal transduction pathways that underlie their activities. In Aim 2, we will establish ISO 13485:2003-specified requirements for a quality management system so that we may more confidently provide contract research services for drug developers. In addition, using a list of 16 well-known cardio effective and toxic drugs/compounds, we will measure drug-induced cardiac function changes using EHTs to establish the benchmark. In Aim 3, we will identify mechanisms of cardiotoxicity, and willdemonstrate the ability of the EHTs to predict cardiotoxicity in vitro, without the need for establishing animal studies. Our approach will advance drug target identification and optimization as well as biomarker discovery-critical for diagnosing cardiotoxicity. As a demonstration of the ability of our approach to elucidate a mechanism of cardiotoxicity, we will use, as an example, genetic knockdown with shRNA and drugs to inhibit mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin). Successful completion of our aims willprove the ability of our in vitro system to predict drug-induced cardiotoxicity in humans, clearly benefiting early-stage drug discovery.

The proposed project will establish a comprehensive cardiotoxicity assessment system using engineered heart tissues fabricated with cardiomyocytes derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells. With the new technology, drug developers can predict potential drug-induced cardiotoxicity at the early stages of drug discovery so will reduce late-stage attrition and protect patients from developing cardiac failure.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major goal in the post-genomic era is to express the vast collection of protein- coding sequences, eventually resulting in a better understanding of protein interactions and the development of novel therapeutics. Themost favored host for heterologous recombinant protein expression is Escherichia coli. Despite many improvements, producing soluble proteins in E. coli is still a major bottleneck for structural genomics: typically, gt50% of recombinant proteins are expressed in an insoluble form. Methods to optimize soluble protein expression are labor- and reagent-intensive. They involve screening for growth conditions, host strains, and solubility enhancing fusion partners and assessing solubility by cell lysis, fractionation and gel electrophoresis. The goal of the proposed research is to develop an integrated system of expression vectors and host strains to improve soluble expression of recombinant proteins. The system will include a novel yellow fluorescent protein tagthat will function as an in vivo reporter of expression and solubility of the recombinant protein. This simple visual readout will facilitate individual and high-throughput expression screening. Further, we will exploit this reporter system to conduct genetic screens for novel protein fusion partners that promote soluble expression of difficult targets. We will validate the resulting   solubility tags   and incorporate them into a suite of products for protein expression and purification. The resulting system will enable high-throughput optimization of soluble protein expression through parallel screening of fusion partners, host strains, and expression conditions. It will likewise be a great advantage for expression of individual proteins, minimizing the use of labor and reagents. The success of these efforts is expected to have a major impact on biomedicine, both for academic purposes and for development of protein therapeutics.

Importantly, 30% of the 151 biopharmaceutical proteins, worth  53B in product sales in 2005, were produced in E. coli. However, production of foreign proteins in bacteria is hampered by the inability of many proteins to fold into a soluble conformation.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the last decade there has been an explosive growth in the field of ubiquitin research, with approximately 530 human genes predicted to encode enzymes involved in the conjugation and deconjugation of ubiquitin. Of these 95 encode for deubiquitylases (DUBs). In order understand the biology of these enzymes better, there is a need for better assays to measure the most physiologically relevant activity of the enzymes. All the currently available high throughput methods for measuring deubiquitylase activity rely on C-terminal amidohydrolase activity (involved in processing the precursors of ubiquitin) rather than the isopeptidase activity involved in ubiquitin deconjugation (important in regulating various cellular processes) of DUBs. The most widely used substrate, Ub-AMC has a small fluorophore attached to the C-terminus of ubiquitin via an amide bond. Hydrolysis of this C-terminal amide bond by a deubiquitylase leads to an increase in fluorescence. This assay format doesnot adequately mimic the more important physiological event - deconjugation of ubiquitin via isopeptidase activity. Furthermore, many DUBs do not possess C-terminal amidohydrolytic activity and hence are unable to cleave conjugates like Ub-AMC. Although itis possible to measure isopeptidase activity with physiological substrates such as commercially available ubiquitin chains by SDS-PAGE, western blotting or LC/MS, such options are viable only if a small number of samples are being tested. For screening small molecules or natural products for inhibitors of isopeptidases these methods are unacceptable. In Phase I we developed a novel fluorescent assay for measuring the actual isopeptidase activity of the DUBs with substrates that are more relevant to physiological conditions. This assay is amenable to high throughput screening and does not suffer from the limitations shared by current DUB assays. Briefly, we have created a series of diUb molecules in which one Ub chain is derivatized with a fluorescence quenching dye and the second Ub moiety carrys a fluorophore. The two Ubs are joined by an isopeptide bond linking the C-terminus of one Ub to either Lys48 (K48) or Lys63 (K63) of the second Ub. Following hydrolysis of this isopeptide bond by a DUB, FRET-quenching is released and the resulting increase in fluorescence is directly proportional to DUB activity. We have validated these substrates using DUBs which only cleave the K48- or K63-linkage. In the current grant application, we propose to extend this technology to the remaining 5 Lys&#039;s in ubiquitin and create a panel of substrates encompassing all of ubiquitin isopeptide linkages. These substrates will greatly enhance our understanding of DUB activity and selectivity and enable high throughput screening campaigns using physiologically relevant substrates.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Modification of proteins by ubiquitin plays important roles in many cellular processes. In the last decade there has been an explosive growth in the field of ubiquitin research. The enzymes that remove ubiquitin from target proteins are very important drug targets. There is a need for better assays to measure the activity of the enzymes, which are highly specific and physiologically relevant. The development of assays using substrates that are physiologically relevant, the topic of this proposal, represents a major advancement in the study of this important group of cellular enzymes.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS) is a proven, powerful and versatile method of eukaryotic protein expression. It is used to produce vaccines, diagnostics, and biologically active proteins for a multitudeof research projects. Like all expression systems, however, BEVS has its disadvantages. One is the fact that expression is short-lived due to virus-induced cell death and lysis. ParaTechs has already commercialized a product that addresses this shortcoming. Cell lines that express a viral ankyrin gene show delayed death and lysis of baculovirus-infected cells, thereby significantly enhancing recombinant protein production. This activity, referred to as vankyrin-enhanced BEVS (VE-BEVSTM), boosts target protein expression up to 22-fold. A second limitation of baculovirus expression is that insect cells lack the ability to produce terminally sialylated, complex N-glycans, which limits the usefulness of BEVS for the expression of human therapeutic proteins. GlycoBac LLC has developed a transgenic insect cell line (SfSWT4) that expresses six mammalian glycosylation enzymes, allowing synthesis of terminally sialyated proteins. This Phase II proposal combines ParaTechs&#039; VE technology with GlycoBac&#039;s cell line to optimize expression of   humanized   N-glycans. In Phase I, the transgenic cell line SfSWT4 was transformed with several vankyrin genes under the control of different promoters. Polyclonal cells were screened for enhanced glycoprotein expression. Data demonstrating that infected cells lived longer and produced more authentically sialylated protein confirmed our hypothesis. Phase II will extend these studies by (1) cloning and characterization of VE-SWTTM cells according to FDA guidelines for cells used to produce vaccines and biological; (2) examining synergistic effects between VE virus vectors and VE-SWT cell lines to provide greater levels of enhancement; and (3) demonstrating enhanced expression of medically relevant glycoproteins in VE-SWTTM cells. These Phase II studies will significantly expand the applications of ParaTechs&#039; VE-BEVS technology and GlycoBac&#039;s glycoengineered cell lines. Personnel at both companies have experience with the techniques to be used. Preliminary studies indicate that this technology has a significant chance of performing as envisioned. Furthermore, prior marketing experience with transformed cell lines previously released from the two companies suggests a significant demand for the expanded technology. This new technology shouldbe relatively easy to commercialize based on the established reputations of ParaTechs, Inc. and GlycoBac, LLC and the growing demand for improved cell lines to express recombinant humanized glycoproteins.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The inability ofinsect cells to produce terminally sialylated, complex N-glycans limits the usefulness of the baculovirus expression system for the production of human therapeutic proteins. This proposal addresses that deficiency and aims to develop new cell lines that produce authentic   humanized   N-glycans in the context of ParaTechs&#039; vankyrin-enhanced baculovirus technology. Successful completion of these objectives will produce cells that provide the highest levels of accurately processed secreted and transmembrane proteins and will be marketed to individual researchers and pharmaceutical companies engaged in structure-function studies of the human secretome and development of protein therapeutics.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Approximately 500,000 bone-grafting procedures are performed each year in the United States. Autologous iliac crest bone graft continues to be the gold standard, because it provides essential elements for bone formation: progenitor cells, an osteoconductive matrix, and osteoinductive molecules. However, iliac crest harvest is associated with a significant number of complications and often provides an inadequate volume of graft. To overcome these limitations, multipotentMesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) have been added to bone graft substitutes and explored for use in tissue engineering applications, such as spinal fusions and bone defect repairs. Bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) are well characterized in their ability to differentiate into cells and tissues of mesodermal origin; however, their frequency in the mononuclear fraction of processed bone marrow is very low. Adipose derived stem cells (ASCs) have been proposed as an alternative to BMSCs for cell therapy because the frequency of multipotent ASCs found in the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of processed lipoaspirate can be several hundred-fold greater than the mononuclear fraction of bone marrow aspirate (BMA), depending on the donor. Currently thereare only a few basic point-of-care devices to concentrate progenitor cells, which are essential elements to foster bone healing. However, these devices are limiting because they are expensive and because they either enrich a non-specific cell population potentially diluting out desired cells or they enrich a specific cell population using antibodies and consequently have safety concerns. In this phase 2 proposal, we will develop a point-of-care autologous ASC enrichment system for bone grafting that eliminates the need for ex vivo cell expansion prior to implantation.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bone grafting is widely used in orthopaedic surgery to treat fractures and large bone defects and to achieve spinal fusions. However, harvesting a bone graft from patients is associated with a significant number of complications and often provides an inadequate amount of tissue. While alternatives to bone grafts have shown promise, there is still room for considerable improvement. Therefore, a device that coulddirectly isolate progenitor cells from complex biological fluids, and then be used at point-of-care in the operating room, would be of significant clinical benefit.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this grant proposal   An Automated Antisense Design and Simulation Platform  , a comprehensive molecular diagnostics software tool that is specific to the design and simulation of antisense oligonucleotide analog probes will be developed. The application of antisense technologies to the study of human diseases has been proven in the literature for cancer, immune deficiency disorders, diabetes, muscular dystrophy and cardiovascular disease, hepatitis A and C, HIV, SARS-coronovirus, Ebola, Dengue Fever, paramyxoviruses (measles), and the West Nile virus. However, the progress of directed antisense research has been slow due to the absence of antisense oligonucleotide analog thermodynamic and kinetic databases, and because the currently used rule-of-thumb design strategies rarely ever initially produce effective probes. Many researchers are then forced to design a small library of probes against the same genomic target to increase their likelihood of success, which is verycostly in both time and financing. The proposed Antisense Design and Simulation Platform will enable the researchers of human diseases by providing a tool for the directed research and evaluation of human and viral genomic targets so that rationally designed antisense oligonucleotide analogs may be used as a molecular diagnostics tool. The developmental strategies for producing the proposed platform are to update existing thermodynamic and kinetic databases and to deploy them on the Antisense Design and Simulation Platform, as outlined in the following specific aims: Aim 1.1: Perform 16 thermodynamic melts each for the fluorophore, biotin and quencher labeled PNA and morpholino antisense probes, and for the phosphorothioate/LNA antisense gap-mer probes to demonstrate the feasibility of applying the nearest-neighbor thermodynamic model to these systems. Aim 1.2: Add the thermodynamic parameters determined in Aim 1.1 to the existing PCR platform Visual OMP to demonstrate the feasibility of applying design andsimulation algorithms to modified antisense oligonucleotide analogs. Aim 2.1: Complete the thermodynamic library for the fluorophore, and quencher labeled PNA and morpholino antisense probes, and for the phosphorothioate/LNA antisense gap-mer probes. Aim 2.2: Perform kinetics experiments on modified morpholino/RNA and PNA/RNA duplexes, and develop predictive mathematical models for the rates of Morpholino/RNA and PNA/RNA hybridization and unfolding. Aim 2.3: Engineer a fully automated Antisense Design and Simulation Platform that will allow researchers to design specific and sensitive antisense probes with minimal user inputs. By the end of this project a fully automated Antisense Design and Simulation Platform will have been designed, tested, and debugged,and made available to antisense researchers for the purpose of beta-testing the commercial product.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Significance: End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) affects a rapidly growing population likely to exceed 1 million patients in the US by 2020. The standard treatment of 3 times per week hemodialysis (HD) has high complicationrates and infection risks, results in undertreated patients, and is unsustainably costly to the health care system. Conventional vascular access site formation and maintenance issues result in more than 25% of HD patients using central venous catheters (CVCs), often for long periods and with even higher infection risks. Less expensive and more patient-friendly alternatives of home peritoneal dialysis (PD) and home hemodialysis (HHD) have not seen wide adoption, in part due to exit site infection risk (in the case of PD) and the need for repeated difficult needle sticks a home (in the case of HHD). The overall goal of this Phase II SBIR proposal is a solution for the critical unmet need of much-improved infection resistance for all types of needle-free dialysis access, including CVCs, PD catheters, and next-generation percutaneously placed ports for HD access. Innovation: We are developing a porous cuff that forms a tightly integrated seal between the cut edge of the skin and the surface of an implanted percutaneous device. Healionics&#039; STARcuffTM has precisely engineered pore geometry (~35 m pores interconnected by ~15 m pore throats) that allows macrophage and dermal cell entry into every pore. This optimized structure promotes vascularized dermal integrationand stable epidermal incorporation without migration, excessive fibrosis, or sinus tract formation. Other porous cuffs with larger (50-500 m) openings achieve mechanical retention by inducing fibrotic ingrowth, but are prone to cuff migration and biofilmformation. Smaller-pored cuffs with pore sizes less than 10 m are even more infection prone, providing shelter for infiltrated bacteria by restricting access for macrophages and other host defense cells. A STARcuff biointerface resists bacterial biofilm formation and recruits a stable, quiescent concentration of host macrophages into the biomaterial, restoring the natural skin barrier and enabling the body&#039;s natural defense mechanisms for fighting bacterial infection. Approach: We have successfully accomplished Phase I goals to 1) establish a porcine percutaneous implant bacterial challenge model, 2) establish a non-invasive technique (infrared thermography) for monitoring exit site infection and 3) demonstrate effectiveness of STARcuff in controlling and reducing this infection. These successful Phase I results position us to move STARcuff technology toward commercial realization on high medical impact percutaneous dialysis devices. Phase II specific aims are to 1) demonstrate improved long-term (9-month) infection resistance, 2) assess the robustness of the skin seal, and 3) extend studies to full CVC devices implanted into a blood vessel. Project success will result in major positive economic impact and Quality of Life benefit for all dialysis patients by reducing acute infection costs, increasing home dialysis use, and creating a healthier patient population. A major catheter company has already expressed commercial interest in the technology and is providing in kind support for the project.          PUBLICHEALTH RELEVANCE: End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) affects a rapidly growing population, likely exceeding 1 million patients in the US by 2020. Patient quality of life and economic issues are major challenges to the present dialysis treatment center systemestablished in the 1970&#039;s. All present methods require penetration of the natural skin barrier to bacteria. Medical treatment of resultant infections has become more costly than the dialysis itself and is a special problem with the catheters often used asa backup to needles for vascular access. Similarly, acceptance of less costly and more patient controlled alternatives such as home hemodialysis could be greatly improved by a needle free vascular access means, but implanted devices for this have sufferedfrom infection problems at the skin interface. We are developing a biomaterial sleeve exhibiting very strong tissue integration and infection resistance at the skin exit sites of access devices. Project success will lead to significant improvements in dialysis effectiveness and efficiency.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ion channels are important drug targets-present in every cell, they play key roles in a wide range of physiological processes including the cardiac cycle and neural activity. As a result, unintended drug interactions with ion channels are also of critical importance, requiring the screening of all drug candidates against specific ion channels. Unfortunately, assaying ion channels for pharmaceutical discovery and safety screening is problematic to perform in high throughput because the ion channels must be incorporated into a cell membrane to allow measurement of their ionic transport to determine their functionality. As a result, there are currently no high quality, high throughput assays for ion channel screening. Recentdevelopments of automated patch clamp instrumentation are still over an order of magnitude lower throughput than conventional drug screening for soluble proteins and also require expensive instrumentation, specialized cell lines, and consumables. For existing methods of ion channel screening, there is a large gap in information quality, throughput, and cost. Librede&#039;s goal is to develop new technologies that increase the efficiency of early stage pharmaceutical research and development. To this end, Librede is developing an alternative cell-free technology for ion channel screening using artificial cell membranes. Librede&#039;s patent pending formulation of cell-free artificial membranes can enable higher throughput and lower consumable costs while requiring less expensive equipment and trained personnel. Librede was founded by UCLA researchers and the inventors of this technology. In Phase I, we measured a 48 membrane array plate simultaneously with a multichannel amplifier and verified that the measurement performance was equal to or exceeded competitive automated patch clamp instruments. In the Phase II work proposed here, we will build on this work by integrating our Phase I instrumentation with fluid handling and motion control hardware to construct an automated workstation for cell-free ion channel screening using Librede&#039;s artificial membrane technology. We will consult with a pharmaceutical screening industry automation expert in the design, construction, and operation of our workstation and confirm that it can process and measure Librede&#039;s artificial membrane plates similarly to our previous work. To demonstrate its capabilities, we will perform a limited screen of CLIC1, an ion channel implicated in Alzheimer&#039;s disease. CLIC1 is particularly difficult toscreen with conventional patch clamp, which makes this an ideal proof-of-concept application of our platform. We will work with the Schmidt group at UCLA, who have previously demonstrated the measurement of CLIC1 in artificial membranes. We will run the workstation in full automation mode, measuring ion channel activity as a function of drug concentration for a 72 compound ion channel-targeted drug library. This demonstration is essentially identical to an industry screen and is a major milestone for Librede&#039;s development of our artificial membrane technology, which promises an order of magnitude improvement in cost and throughput for ion channel screening.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Librede is developing a novel cell-free ion channel screening platform that has the potential to significantly reduce costs and increase throughput of drug discovery and safety screening for ion channels. We will develop an ion channel measurement workstation that is capable of completely automated processing and measurement of Librede&#039;s ion channel plates after the addition of drug compounds modulating the channel activity. We are validating this workstation by screening compounds for activity against the CLIC1 human ion channel which is thought to play an important role in Alzheimer&#039;s disease.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the past several decades there has been relatively little innovation in the arena of medical device sterilization. Ethylene oxide (ETO) and  gamma irradiation (  irradiation) are the only technologies commerciallyavailable for medical devices. In particular, synthetic polymeric medical devices are sterilized almost exclusively by ETO due to undesirable chemical degradation and/or mechanical changes caused by gamma-irradiation. Gamma-irradiation requires cobalt-60 and these facilities are generally housed in large industrial or research institutions that have high operating costs associated with this technology. Suture manufacturers have expressed interest in moving from this process due to the short- and long-term negative effects of residual ETO in sterilized products, the fact that it s a recognized carcinogen, and the precautionary measures needed to operate around the toxic and explosive nature of ETO. Recently the EPA and other government agencies have started to monitor ETO in response to personal and environmental issues. Thus, development of alternative sterilization processes that are capable of achieving validated sterility assurance levels of 10-6 (SAL6) - the benchmark for medical devices - without the useof dangerous ETO or damaging  -irradiation is of great importance. The current proposed effort aims to advance NovaSterilis&#039; supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) sterilization technology and produce a viable method to sterilize suture materials while maintaining suture mechanical properties. The NovaSterilis process is environmentally friendly and uses only carbon dioxide and a chemical sterilant that breaks down into benign compounds during the process. The Phase I work has established the optimal conditions using supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) sterilization technology that have no adverse effects on the mechanical properties and no cytotoxicity of sutures sterilized to SAL6 under ISO guidelines. Thus, the Phase I has allowed us to show feasibility of supercritical carbon dioxide as a method of overcoming the current limitations on sterilization options currently used for sutures. Terminal sterilization using our supercritical carbon dioxide process has the potential to add a one-step validated terminal sterilization process to suture manufacturers and distributors while decreasing the costs and burdens associated with current ethylene oxide sterilization processes. NovaSterilis is ready to begin Phase II in vivo and in vitro advanced testing to assesscommercial- readiness of scCO2-sterilized suture materials to provide the medical device industry with a less toxic and more gentle alternative to current sterilization technologies. NovaSterilis, the lead company for this project, will pair its team of experienced engineers, chemists and biologists, including consultant  Prof. CC Chu of Cornell University, a recognized expert in the arena of suture development, with additional experts in animal toxicity and efficacy testing, scale-up and shelf-life testing. Te Phase I partnership has proven highly successful, and the logical next steps towards commercialization will be accomplished in the Phase II. The primary goal is to ensure the safety and efficacy of sutures sterilized using NovaSterilis supercriticalcarbon dioxide technology through in vivo and in vitro commercial-readiness testing.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Supercritical carbon dioxide sterilization of commercial suture materials presents an environmentally safe technique that does not require harsh conditions currently in use by the suture industry. The future of wound healing is affected by the development of advanced synthetic wound closure materials that will not stand up to current sterilization regimens. There is a clear need in the health care industry for both new materials and safe, innovative approaches to materials sterilization that will eliminate any opportunity for disease transmission.",

The chip&#039;s major advantages are its small size (500  m x 500  m x 100  m), unitary design, inertness, ease of use and very low cost. The system consists of the p-Chip-tagged glassslides and tissue cassettes, a stationary reader, a portable reader for trays with slides, and associated software that allows integration with common database software. The main goals of the project are to: 1) develop semi-automated methods of attachingp-Chips to slides and cassettes, 2) build advanced prototypes of the ID reader (wand) and improve key features, such as the form factors for reading each type of container, 3) improve the design of the p-Chip to increase the read range and refine methods of their post-fabrication processing, and 4) conduct extensive pilot test studies with outside collaborators to validate the system. The ID readers will have a modified optical system and will feature wireless communication between the reader and a workstation or central computer.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This work will create innovative products that allow rapid, low cost, automated, genomic DNA purification from several sample types and concentrations. This novel technology uses a disposable cassette device and low cost, reusable processing cradle to automatically purify DNA by self-contained, semi-dry electrophoretic methodology. Cassettes can be constructed to contain multiple lanes that allow simultaneous purification of a few, or up to 96 samples in one run. The method requires no moving parts and can be performed, with some sample types, in less than 10 minutes. The projected cost of cassettes is  0.4 -  0.8 per sample, while the portable processing cradle will cost less than  250 for a 1-12 sample version, or  750for a 96-sample version. This product, if fully realized, could revolutionize the way that DNA is prepared for clinical or reference laboratory diagnostic procedures. It will reduce costs and save labor and materials.  Work performed in Phase I with prototypes of the purification cassette and processing devices showed that DNA prepared from blood, bacteria, saliva or tissue is highly pure and can be used directly in PCR amplification, as well as other molecular biology applications. Phase I work also showedthat the method could begin with a wide range of sample concentrations, as the starting sample could be diluted 100-500 fold, and method still yielded active DNA template.  The purification method utilizes a variation of technology that our company developed for automated plasmid DNA purification, combined with technology for running agarose gels without running buffer.  Phase II work will result in the working prototypes for the cassettes and processing cradle instruments. Aims of Phase II are to: 1) Further optimize the electrophoretic voltage programs. 2) Improve the lower detection limit of bacterial and mammalian cells, including purification of DNA from single mammalian cells. 3) Improve the lysis chemistry. 4) Determine the scope of activity of the purified DNA. 5) Develop a protocol for small volumes of blood. 6) Develop the 12 and 96-well processing cradle instruments. 7) Finalize the 2, 6, 12 and 24-well cassette design and contract for the construction of injection molds. 8) Draft an instruction manual and product specifications. Our company will be able to manufacture and sell instruments and cassettes developed from this work directly after Phase II. The market potential for these products is estimated to be ~ 50 million. The products are also applicable to clinical labs and possibly doctor&#039;s office settings.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal will create innovative products that allow rapid, low cost, automated, multi-sample genomic DNA purification from many sample types and concentrations.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  It is recently discovered that a significant portion of the modified cytosines in mammalian genomes is 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC), an oxidation product of 5-methylcytosine (5-mC). Current methods including bisulfite conversion cannot distinguish or determine its genomic locations. The proposed research in this grant application is based on a novel family of modification-dependent restriction endonucleases (REs), represented by PvuRts1I. Unlike other existing REs, these enzymes recognize 5-hmC in DNA and cleave at fixed distances away from their recognition sites. The glucosylation status of the 5-hmC can have significant effects on the cleavage efficiency. Using ultra high throughput sequencing platforms and genomicDNA digested with PvuRts1I family enzymes, one should be able to identify and map 5-hmC reliably. Therefore, application of these PvuRts1I family enzymes can provide a foundation for the next generation of methods for analyzing epigenetic modification.  In Phase I research, we plan to purify the recombinant enzymes and characterize their biochemical properties in detail in vitro. In Phase II research, we plan to determine the molecular structure of at least one of these enzymes both in its apo-form (without DNA) and as an enzyme complex with a 5-hmC DNA substrate. We will establish methodologies whereby these enzymes can be used to decode the DNA hydroxymethylation patterns in human, mouse, and several other model organisms. We will also examine the dynamics of DNA hydroxymethylation during mouse embryonic stem cell differentiation and at various developmental stages. Another goal of the Phase II research will be to isolate mutants that will contain improved properties. This work will be based on the molecular structures and our previously established enzyme engineering protocols. Furthermore, emphasis will be given to isolating mutants that have no enzymatic activity, yet have high binding affinity for the 5-hmC to be used as an affinity reagent and for in vivo labeling of the 5-hmC in mammalian nuclei. We believe our proposed research is innovative and timely, and will help to decode the next layer of epigenetic information in the mammalian genome. A full understanding of these enzymes and their novel applications in decoding epigenetic information will allow us to develop new products and kits that should have a major impact for the broader biomedical community interested in studying epigenetic modifications.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Protein therapeutics is the fastest growing segment in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry with annual sales totaling over  70 billion. Protein therapeutics includes monoclonal antibodies, recombinant proteins, chimeric proteins and other protein receptor constructs. A major hurdle in the development of proteins as pharmaceutical drugs is their formulation in a safe and stable form. The identification of buffer, ligand and excipient conditions that maximize their stability and eliminate protein aggregation is critical during development and often requires the evaluation of hundreds of conditions. This time-consuming task is compounded by the absence of completely automated instruments with the capability of accurately measuring the stability/aggregation matrix of a protein. The goal of this proposal is to develop a fully automated, protein chemical denaturation, fluorescence instrument aimed at measuring multi- dimensional protein stability and aggregation matrices. Unlike any other currently available instrument, this instrument will be capable of automatically preparing and analyzing up to 96 protein denaturation curves - enough to complete an entire formulations study for a new biologic. In this instrument, the user will only need to provide protein and bulk formulation solutions. The instrument will automatically prepare all solutions, perform the measurements, analyze the data and present the results to the investigator.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This instrument will significantly accelerate the development of protein therapeutics and find a significant market. In addition, it will provide a new way to study protein stability and aggregation, and contribute to the development of a better scientific understanding of these issues.

In the United States, there are over 500,000 spinal fusion surgeries every year, and the frequency of these surgeries is projected to grow 6% per year. The gold standard for bone graft in spinal fusion is autograft from the iliac crest; however, the use of autograft presents multiple challenges including donor site morbidity, blood loss, limited availability, prolonged operating times, and pseudarthrosis due to a slow rate of fusion. As a result, there is a large effort to develop bone graft substitutes or extenders that can not only reduce or replace the need for harvest of autogenous bone but also accelerate the rate of fusion (arthrodesis). Ceramic bone graft substitutes provide osteoconductive and bioresorbable bone graft substitutes but have shown poor results when used as stand-alone treatments. Bone marrow aspirate contains osteoinductive factors, but the current carriers are not adequate for the retention and release of these osteoinductive factors over a prolonged period of time. Therefore, there is an unmet clinical need in spinal fusion surgery for a safe, cost-effective bone graft substitute that can maintain a sustained dose of osteoinductive factors throughout the early stages of the healing process. We have developed a bone graft substitute that can capture and retain osteoinductive growth factors and propose to test its ability to improve the fusion rate in spinal fusion surgery.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Spinal fusion surgery is an effective treatment for back pain but carries multiple risks. We have developed a medical device that can improve the formation of new bone andreduce the risks found with other products. We propose to test our product in a model of spinal fusion.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Improving human health by enabling the development of drugs faster and cheaper is an important part of the NIH mission. This is partially achieved by introducing and constantly improving enabling technologies. One suchtechnology is structure based drug design. Determining the structure of a small molecule (drug candidate or lead compound) to a biological receptor (protein implicated in disease) is a necessary step in this methodology. The dominant experimental approachused to achieve this goal is X- ray crystallography, while nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) plays a lesser role in spite of large investments both in academia and industry. NMR is hampered by the size of protein that can be studied and the need to go through a lengthy structure determination process. However, with the advent of fragment based drug design, NMR is playing a much larger role and it could play an even greater role if it was possible to reduce the time effort necessary to solve the structure ofa protein-ligand complex. Moreover, in cases where it is not possible to obtain a crystal NMR can play a significant role. Through the use of solid-state NMR studies membrane proteins or proteins with solubility problems can be studied or in cases where only homology models of a protein are available NMR could play a role through the validation of active site structure hypotheses generated in homology modeling studies. The aim of the proposed research is to extend and commercialize QuantumBio&#039;s successful linear-scaling semiempirical quantum mechanical NMR approach (NMRScore) to chemical shift perturbation (CSP) analysis through the addition of target-observed CSP and ab initio NMR methods. In Phase I of this proposal the limits of applicability will be explored. In the Phase II proposal extension of the methodology via reparameterization of 1H, 13C 17O and 15N NMR will be carried out and a new classical NMR predictor will be developed. Furthermore, the streamlining of the workflow will be researched and implemented. Finally, this proposal is aiming to fully productize and commercialize this breakthrough technology. It is anticipated that by making this application commercially available the use of NMR in structure-based design efforts will be enhanced and theNMR tool and service market size can be further expanded. Significantly, the tool-box of structure based drug design will gain an important new method which will enable drug development for targets inaccessible to today&#039;s mainstream drug discovery paradigm. Thus, in the near future important underserved diseases can be targeted more efficiently.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over 700,000 surgical hernia repairs are performed each year in the United States and despite recent advances, a significant rate of recurrence persists. Of these surgeries, 100,000 are for incisional or visceral herniarepairs, which cost 1.7B annually and have a recurrence rate that can be up to 60%. The incorporation of biocompatible mesh to strengthen the abdominal fascia has largely replaced high-tension suturing techniques in surgical hernia repair. Currently, thepreferred biomaterials include durable synthetic mesh, which bears all the pitfalls of a permanent foreign body; absorbable mesh which does not provide enough long- term support; or bioprosthetics, which are bioabsorbable but still fail at an unacceptablyhigh rate causing recurrent hernias. Surgeons are therefore left to choose between poor options for a repair. Our goal is to accelerate healing rates after hernia repair by using bioprosthetics containing adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs). ASCs were identified in 2001, and have been used for cell therapy in many indications including bone fractures, myocardial repair and soft tissue repair. Their prohealing function is largely mediated through paracrine factors secreted at the site of injury to promote vascularization and tissue remodeling. The product will be a point-of-care ASC seeded bioprosthetic that will promote faster healing times, prevent infection, and leave a biologic repair. Our bioprosthetic is designed to prevent recurrence of incisional hernias, thereby reducing inpatient follow-up care, additional surgeries, and patient distress.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Improving the rate of healing after surgical hernia repair will reduce pain, discomfort and follow-up care. The use of adult stem cells in soft tissue healing represents a potential improvement for surgical procedures. This proposal will develop a novel bioprosthetic for the local retention of cells to improve healing rates and reduce recurrence of incisional hernia repairs.",

One particular focus will be on restriction endonucleases that are able to recognize modified DNA, especially DNA containing 5-methylcytosine and 5- hydroxymethycytosine since such enzymes have many potential applications in epigenetics research. Enzymes recognizing these modified bases are known to occur in bacterial and archaea strains and in the past,many have been found by random biochemical screening. In the proposed project, the discovery of potential new enzymes will use bioinformatics techniques and take advantage of the large number of currently sequenced prokaryotic genomes, both completely sequenced genome and shotgun sequences. The project will identify good candidates and then use biochemical methods to characterize them. In addition to commercializing any useful enzymes that are found from this screen, the information gained about the biochemical function of the restriction enzymes discovered will be invaluable for genome annotation and will have practical implications for researchers working with pathogenic organisms. The latter will result from our efforts to characterize the restriction-modification systems in pathogens and identify those systems which need either to be knocked out or circumvented by prior modification prior to transformation. Thus, the results of this research will have immediate implications for the fields of epigenetics,pathogenesis and genome annotation.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The separation of enantiomers (i.e. chiral separations) is of great importance in the development of safe chiral pharmaceuticals and the study of chiral biological toxins and carcinogens. For pharmaceutical compounds that are chiral, usually one enantiomer (either the right or left-handed version) is the drug, while the other half causes side effects, different effects, similar effects or in limited cases, no effects. In the cas of biological toxins, understanding the chirality involved in their mechanism of action is necessary. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will support the development of novel chiral selectors and chiral stationary phases based on the new cyclic oligosaccharide cyclofructan. Cyclofructans, or cycloinulooligosaccharides, are  -(2-1)-linked cyclic fructofuranose oligomers. In their native forms, they show little enantioselectivity when used as chiral stationary phases. However, Phase I results indicate that certain derivatives ofcyclofructan make outstanding chiral selectors. This unique enantioselective chromatographic media is likely to be the greatest advancement in the resolution of enantiomers in the past 15 years. These chiral selectors will play a major role as separation media in pharmaceutical, medicinal, and synthetic organic chemistry. The aim of the Phase II proposal of this SBIR is to further develop these broadly effective chiral stationary phases and to bring them to the commercialization level. Specifically, we willdevelop the production means for these chiral stationary phases (i.e. synthesis and packing methods), test their reproducibility, build prototype  columns for evaluation by experts in our target market, refine scale-up procedures to prepare for manufacturing, and begin marketing and forming strategic alliances with partners, distributors, and future investors. As a result of this proposed work, this technology will bring to market a new tool that will allow for the production of better and less expensive pharmaceutical products that have fewer side effects and can be given in lower doses. Also, we have better means to study their distribution and action in biological experiments and understand the biological actions of chiral toxins.          PUBLIC HEALTHRELEVANCE: Pharmaceutical compounds that are chiral (from the Greek word for   hand  ) can exist as enantiomers (i.e., right and left-handed versions of the same basic compound). For medicines of this sort, usually one enantiomer (either the right or left-handed version) is the drug, while the other half causes side effects, different effects, similar effects r in limited cases, no effects. Since 1992 the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has had specific guidelines in place for the development and use ofthese types of drug products. In our proposed research we introduce a new class of chiral selectors called cyclofructans. During our Phase I research, we proved the feasibility of synthetically altering cyclofructans so they can be used to analyze, separate and purify most classes of chiral pharmaceutical compounds. Furthermore, these chiral selectors will prove useful in the enantiomeric separation of other biologically relevant chiral compounds. We believe that cyclofructans are the most important class of chiral selectors to be discovered in at least the last 15 years. As a result of this proposed work, Americans will have better and less expensive pharmaceutical products that have fewer side effects and can be given in lower doses. Also we have better means to study stereoselective effects of chiral biological molecules including toxins.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this SBIR Fast Track we focus on a novel chiral chemistry process technology that enables baseline separation, identification of absolute stereochemistry and purity analysis, all in one instrument and within minutes.The technology offers significant cost and time savings in chiral chemistry processing through inexpensive components and predictive software. Briefly, when placed in a capillary and exposed to a Rotating Electric Field (REF), left and right-handed chiralmolecules rotate with the field and act as nanoscale propellers with respect to their solvent. Due to their opposite handedness, they propel along the axis of field rotation in opposite directions, enabling both isolation and analysis, including absoluteconfiguration determination. Current techniques for chiral analysis and isolation such as high pressure liquid chromatography, x-ray crystallography and vibrational circular dichromism are frequently time consuming, expensive, low fidelity and are generally hindrances to the widespread study of chiral chemistry. This proposed new technique, relying on hydrodynamic chirality and principles of physics, promises to enable the creation of an easy-to-use, order of magnitude less expensive, benchtop instrument for chiral analysis and isolation. With more researchers, companies and universities able to afford chiral analysis and isolation, the pace of chiral drug study, discovery and commercialization is bound to increase. The FDA, due to the generally proven benefits of single enanatiomer compounds, mandates that most new drugs be enantiospecific, increasing the need for new chiral separation and analysis techniques.  In Phase I, the Specific Aims are to 1) Design and build a robust and reliable REF separation chamber operating at up to 300MHz and 100V p-p; 2) Demonstrate quantitatively, 99% pure enantiomeric separation and high fidelity absolute configuration determination of at least two chiral molecules in both polar and nonpolar solvents; and 3) Investigate design parameter tradeoffs including voltage and frequency dependence and throughput up to gram per day scale. We will use rotating electric fields, microfluidics and chiral detection to achieve chiral analysis and isolation. Once the technique is proven in Phase I, for Phase II the Specific Aims 1) Design and build a board- level-integrated separation assembly; 2) Design a disposable separation chamber with cost of goods less than  10 at analytical scale; 3) Develop and integrate predictive software with highfidelity and ease-of-use for non-experts; 4) Demonstrate broad applicability for at least 100 chiral molecules in polar and nonpolar solvents; and 5) Demonstrate baseline separation at milligram scale. In addition to Phase I methods, we will use ab initio,molecular mechanics and molecular dynamics simulations to determine propulsion direction and velocity.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ability to separate chiral molecules using a very inexpensive and easy-to-operate instrument, with predictive software, will enable a benchtop, turnkey solution for all researchers, companies and academic institutions to expand their activities in chiral chemistry. Because most new pharmaceutical compounds are chiral molecules, the ability for more chemists to discern between and work with right or left-handed chirally pure molecules will increase the rate and lower the cost of drug discovery and development, including all scales from analytical up to pilot manufacturing. In short, this tool will significantly impact all industries working with chiral molecules, including pharmaceuticals, biotech, agricultural, neutraceuticals, and others.",

Furthermore, it will expand the applications that this device can serve, including translational and clinical point-of-care flow cytometry applications for diagnostics, prognosis, and personalized medicine. Having completed key milestones in the Phase I program, such as mas- producible injection molded chips, advanced signal detection and processing and key performance metrics, we propose to extend the capabilities to compete with best-in-class devices. Our Aims for this project are to create a device (NanoSort-1 or NS-1) that will have improved performance parameters of 6-color detection with a single photomultiplier tube (PMT), 4-way sorting using low shear stress piezoelectric (PZT) actuators, and a robust digital signal processing algorithm (Color-Space-Time (CoST) implementation that allows 10,000 events per second detection and sorting. In addition to these innovations, we will construct the device using current good manufacturing processes (cGMP) to assure that this device will be UL and CE certified and scalable to 10,000 units per year.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Categorical outcomes are ubiquitous in biomedical research, and generalized linear models (GLMs) represent the most widely applied methodology for testing associations between categorical variables and fixed investigative factors. Logistic regression in particular is the most frequently used model for binary data and has widespread applicability in the health, behavioral, and physical sciences. King and Ryan (2002) stated that there were 2,770 research papers published in 1999 in which   logistic regression   was in the title of the paper or among the keywords. King and Zeng (2001) referred to the use of the maximum likelihood method in logistic regression as   the nearly universal method  . Maximum likelihood estimates (MLE) for logistic regression are based on large sample approximations that are reliable for problems with large samples and when the proportion of responses is not too small or too large. However, it has been known for several years that MLE are not reliable for small, sparse or unbalanced datasets, with the latter referring to a considerable difference between the number of zeros and ones of the response variable. Recent research has suggested a flexible means of correcting MLE bias and improving performance using a penalized likelihood-based approach, but the underlying theory has not been fully applied and implemented for practical use. In this project, we will extend the work begun during Phase 1 with logistic regression by (1) implementing the bias correction approach for a variety of other GLM&#039;s that include Poisson, multinomial, negative binomial, and censored survival data; (2) provide new diagnostic procedures that identify potential problems with near separability and MLE bias; (3) implement and evaluate an exact target estimation approach for bias correction in logistic regression; (4) improve the computational algorithms required for Aims 1-3; and (5) additionally implement the procedures in a SAS PROC. Given the ubiquity of categorical regressionin public health and biomedical research, the final product of this effort will provide a critical intermediate alternative when analyzing data for which standard large-sample methods are unreliable and small-sample exact methods are infeasible.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Generalized linear models (such as logistic regression) for categorical data have widespread applicability in the health sciences. Maximum likelihood, the nearly universal method for computing estimates in generalized linear regression models, has been known to have high bias and mean square error for small, sparse or unbalanced datasets. We propose to develop commercial software that incorporates several new methods that have lower bias and mean square error in logistic regression and other generalized linear models and Cox proportional hazard models.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Newborn screening is currently performed by collecting dried bloodspots from infants and then sending them to a lab for analysis. It is primarily performed to detect disorders which lead to severe physical and mental disabilities. There is an increasing necessity to screen for a number of lysosomal storage disorders for which therapies are becoming available. Tandem mass spectrometry is a multiplex detection technology widely utilized in newborn screening, but when applied to enzyme assays it is expensive, time consuming, and labor intensive. There is a need for an inexpensive, rapid, and automated technology for performing newborn screening assays.  A digital microfluidic cartridge, which is essentially a liquid handlingsystem operating on sub- microliter droplets, has  been developed for performing fluorometric enzymatic assays for screening lysosomal storage disorders using dried blood spots. This system is configured to enable walkaway automation and multiplex severalassays inexpensively. In phase II, we have successfully demonstrated assays for Pompe, Fabry, Gaucher, Hunter and Hurler disorders using a single punch from a dried blood spot. The digital microfluidic method compared favorably with a   gold standard   fluorometric enzymatic method performed in microtiter plates at Duke University for all the 5 disorders. The digital microfluidic system is currently under a pilot trial in the Illinois Newborn  Screening Laboratory. Over 6,000 dried blood spots have been screened for Pompe, Fabry, and Gaucher during the ongoing pilot study. Following a positive results on this platform, 4 infants were further confirmed with Fabry disease and 1 infant with Gaucher disease. Phase IIB continuation will focus on addressing several user issues that were identified during the pilot trial, submission of a 510(k) application to the FDA, and expansion of the newborn screening assay panel to include other LSDs which are mandated or which have therapies available/under development.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Newborn screening is performed on almost every infant born in the US. Due to the availability of therapies, there is a growing interest in adding lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) to the panel of tests. In this project, a cost-effective microfluidic platform will be developed and validated for newborn screening of LSDs. Illinois, Missouri and New Mexico have mandated laws requiring screening all the babies for LSDs and availability of this inexpensive platform will make it affordable for cash-strapped states. During a limited pilot trial of this platform in Illinois, some babies with LSDs were already identified.",

Available SGDs are difficult for children to use and time consuming for adults to program. Without appropriate SGDs, children miss valuable opportunities to communicate and develop language skills during their early years, when they are predisposed to language development. The proposed research continues development of software that successfully addresses these problems. Named PlayTalk, this software encourages interaction and communication that appeals to young children. It uses developmentally appropriate representations, organizations, and navigational techniques so it is easy for young children to understand and use. It also enables adults to add communication displays and language concepts easily and quickly while interacting with the child, without disrupting the fun and learning. The Phase 1 study clearly demonstrated feasibility. PlayTalk wasfast and easy for parents and professionals to learn and use, and it supported communication and language learning by young children with complex communication needs better than current SGDs.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The importance of reducing the incidence of secondary injuries related to manual wheelchair (MWC) propulsion is undisputed. Based on several research studies, approximately 50% of manual wheelchair users (MWU) report symptoms of repetitive strain injury (RSI) related to the demand on the upper extremity during propulsion and transferring tasks. A substantial effort has gone toward understanding and trying to reduce the incidence of RSI through improved wheelchair technology, training, and clinical practice. Despite these efforts, it is still argued that all long-term (gt15yrs) MWU are likely to acquire a RSI. Technical advances, such as lighter and more adjustable wheelchairs have helped reduce the risk factors for RSI by decreasing the average propulsion force and increasing the stroke length during propulsion. By decreasing overall risk for RSI, these technical advances make progress, but more can and should be done to help preserve the mobility independence of MWU. A persistent problem during manual wheelchair propulsion is the difficulty while propelling over sloped terrain. Outdoors, sloped terrains are unavoidable-running-slopes (in the direction of travel) are necessary to transitions from one grade to another, andcross-slopes are required for water drainage. Although the ADA accessibility guidelines place upper limits on the allowable angle of these slopes these limits are often not followed, and any sloped surface can be burdensome to a MWU and increase the risk of an RSI, especially the cross-slope angle. Research findings suggest that a cross-slope angle of 2 degrees requires a 30% greater effort than propelling on flat ground. Additionally, based on perceived comfort, a one degree increase in cross-slope is equivalent to a 3.6 degree increase in running slope. Other research has demonstrated that an 80% increase in propulsive forces is necessary when propelling over a 6 degree cross-slope. The underlying mechanism causing the increased propulsion demand and decreased comfort is the tendency of the wheelchair to drift down the slope. This is due location of the center of gravity (which is forward of the rear axle) and the unconstrained rotation of the caster wheels. The goal of this project is to finalize the development and testing of the PathLock system, which biases the caster to maintain a strait path. Our Phase I prototype was positively received by clinicians and WCUs and valuable feedback was gathered about design modifications. Year 1 of this proposal will be to finalize the design and testing of the PathLock for TiLite TR wheelchairs, and Year 2 will be devoted to adapting the PathLock to other varieties and classifications of MWCs.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to finalize thedesign and development of the Pathlock system, which biases a wheelchair caster to help the user maintain a straight path during propulsion. This can be helpful if a user is carrying an object in one hand, is traveling over a cross-slope, or has unilateralfunctional deficit (such as hemiplegia).",

These digestive diseases, which affect 2-5% of preterm babies, frequently require major surgery and are associated with a mortality rate of20-50%. The etiology of both NEC and SIP have yet to be fully elucidated, and risk factors that have been identified, in addition to a birth weight o lt 1.5 kg, include formula feeding and the use of indomethacin, the standard of care to treat and/or prevent the development of Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA), a condition which results in the circulation short-circuiting the pulmonary vasculature, leading to inadequate oxygenation, increasing the risk of intraventricular hemorrhage, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and death. In this Phase II application we will further develop and evaluate a novel proprietary parenteral formulation of indomethacin, in which the NSAID is non-covalently associated with phosphatidylcholine (PC) to make it safer for the GI tract. Thiscomposition of Indomethacin-PC (PL4500) appears to reduce the GI injury caused by indomethacin alone in adult animals. In the prior Phase I experiments, we found that there was an apparent resistance to GI toxicity of indomethacin in rat neonates before weaning if the animals were breast- fed, but not if they were formula-fed. Also, during weaning there were developmentally increasing levels of both intestinal bile acid and ileal bile acid uptake transporter (apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter,ASBT) which may be associated with indomethacin GI toxicity. It is important for later FDA filings to understand the possible mechanism of GI injury by indomethacin and how indomethacin-PC may offer protection. Thus, the first aim is to evaluate the GI toxicity of indomethacin-PC versus unmodified indomethacin in neonatal mice by comparing toxicity in breast-fed and formula-fed mice at different postnatal ages; comparing toxicity in a model of NEC; and comparing toxicity in wildtype and ASBT knockout mice and in mice induced to express ASBT early. The second aim is to determine the efficacy of indomethacin-PC versus indomethacin in a model of PDA. The third aim is to carry out technology transfer to a contract commercial manufacturer and initiate scale- up of Indomethacin-PC production, with the goal of yielding a prototype parenteral formulation that is suitable for stability, dispersibility, and subsequent safety evaluation in Phase I clinical trials. The development activities encompassed in this grant proposal will significantly advance PL4500 toward commercialization. If the Indomethacin-PC formulation continues to possess an improved GI safety profile, together with equivalent efficacy compared with indomethacin, it will represent an important improvement in the standard of care for the treatment of low birth weight neonates with potential or confirmed PDA, by reducing risk of developing NEC and SIP, devastating diseases of the GI tract.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Low birth weight infants, that areborn prematurely, are highly susceptible to a number of potentially life- threatening conditions including Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA) and Necrotizing Enterocolitis (NEC). PDA is a congenital disease of the heart commonly found in premature infants that can lead to inadequate oxygenation and death. The standard treatment for PDA is intravenous indomethacin (Indocin(R)) which is known to be associated with gastrointestinal (GI) tract side effects including: intestinal bleeding, perforatios and sepsis inmature animals and humans. NEC is the most common surgical emergency that affects premature infants in the neonatal intensive care unit causing perforations, excessive GI bleeding, and an invasion of pathogenic and commensal bacteria. It is our hypothesisthat the use of Indocin(R) in low birth weight infants to treat PDA may be an important etiological factor in NEC. The product under development in this proposal, designated PL4500, is a formulation of indomethacin that is associated with phosphatidylcholine to make it safer for the GI tract, and help protect low birth weight babies from developing NEC-like disease.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Consumption of unhealthy media messages that normalize or glorify risky sex is related to early and risky sexual behaviors in adolescents. Critical analysis of these media messages promotes healthy perspective-taking about relationships and sexual behaviors. The proposed project will complete the development of Media World Relationships, a prevention program that focuses on teaching media literacy education to students in grades 7-9 to increase critical thinking skills about media messages, increase intentions to abstain from sexual activity, and increase the likelihood of safe behaviors should sexual activity occur. The ultimate goals of the program are to prevent early sexual behaviors, STI transmission, and teen pregnancy. The program is highly innovative due to its focus on a broad range of important sexual health topics, attention to a risk factor often ignored in sexual risk prevention program s (i.e., media), use of a well-defined conceptual framework (i.e., MIP model), and cutting-edge blended-learning pedagogy. The 8-lesson program consists of a Teacher&#039;s Manual and a DVD with 8 multimedia classroom presentations with integrated video and audio clips that are designed to be used while teaching each lesson. The program will also include two brief e-learning modules designed to provide health education on STIs and contraception. Program development in Phase II will consist of making revisions to the core program based on feedback gained in Phase I, creating the seconde-module, and translating the in-person teacher training into a web-based format. Finally, a randomized control trial with a three-month follow-up will be conducted to evaluate the program&#039;s effectiveness for promoting healthy youth outcomes. One of the added benefits of this innovative program is that while potentially enhancing the sexual health of adolescents, it also emphasizes the development and refinement of critical thinking skills valued in education which should foster dissemination.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The early and risky sexual behaviors of adolescents are significant public health concerns and media literacy education-based interventions appear to be a promising approach to promote healthy perspective taking about relationships and sexual behaviors. This application seeks to complete the development of Media World Relationships, a media literacy education program for grades 7-9 and evaluate the program&#039;s effectiveness for promoting healthy relationships, delaying the onset of adolescent sexual activity, and preventing risky sexual behaviors and teen pregnancy in a randomized control trial. This project will result in the development of a commercially available, teacher-friendly, educational tool with empirically-tested results and fill in the identified gap in the commercially-available, evidence-based prevention programs for adolescent sexual health.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This FastTrack SBIR proposal aims to disseminate a Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) technology for stroke ambulation and neuromotor rehabilitation. The FastFES paradigm integrates two rehabilitation approaches,fast-paced treadmill walking and FES, in a manner that has been shown to both improve gait kinematics when the stimulation is active and to improve performance in clinical tasks with long-term intervention. Precisely timed FES patterns provide: 1) a plantarflexion (PF) assist effect during the terminal double-stance phase of gait; and 2) a dorsiflexion (DF) assist effect during the swing phase. Compared to commercially available DF-only systems, the FastFES device will provide improved paretic leg ground reaction forces during push-off as a result of the PF stimulation pattern. This will act to propel the paretic leg through the swing phase of the gait cycle and thus provide more normal gait kinematics. The technology has been developed at the University ofDelaware in the laboratory of Dr. Stuart Binder-Macleod, PT, PhD. The FastFES system will include a leg-worn stimulator that is wirelessly coupled to an instrumented footswitch system. Instrumentation will provide robust and reliable gait cycle measurements to facilitate coordination of the complex FES patterns to the client&#039;s volitional gait. A clinician configuration pendant will allow clinicians to program advanced features of the device and to manage multiple users in a clinical environment. The devicewill also record gait cycle data to summarize its use and to aid the clinician in assessing the device&#039;s effectiveness for a particular client. The Phase I project will prove concept feasibility by demonstrating that customKYnetics&#039; stimulator can implement the FastFES&#039;s variable frequency train (VFT) stimulation pattern such that contractions of human skeletal muscle are of comparable quality to those produced by the laboratory stimulator. The Phase II project will involve significant engineering efforts to develop the commercialization-ready system and will include a validation study at UD in which individuals with paresis secondary to a stroke iteratively evaluate device prototypes. Efficacy will be demonstrated through a long-term, single-blinded, randomized, controlled clinical intervention study. Outcomes will include kinematic assessment of the client&#039;s gait pattern (with and without stim) and assessments of changes in clinical function. The target market for the device will be rehabilitation clinics that serve the stroke market. The device will also be suitable for home/community-use. The product will provide clear differentiation over existing products in the space. The target price for a clinical system will be  5,000. The addressable market is estimated at 10,000 units for a clinical system and at least 500,000 units for a home system.   PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The proposed work may benefit health through development of a functional electrical stimulation system indicated for ambulation and neuromotor rehabilitation following stroke (795,000 cases per year). Due to the novel combination of plantarflexion and dorsiflexion stimulation during ambulation, the proposed FastFES system may provide improved leg ground reaction forces and provide more normalgait kinematics.",

This is a very vexing and routine problem for caregivers, and sometimes results in physical and emotional danger to the individuals who may wander. The system consists of an innovative wearable electronic navigation unit, which reports the position of the individual continuously to the caregiver, both i indoor and outdoor locations, irrespective of GPS coverage. This unit is specially designed for addressing the complicated issue of arbitrary pedestrian motion in unstructured indoor and outdoor environments.The system can also be integrated with other community and national safety networks (such as Amber Alert), and can be valuable in quickly locating individuals in emergency situations. In Phase I, we evaluated a preliminary device in a focus group of parents, teachers, autism risk management professionals, and researchers. We gathered refined user requirements, usability recommendations, and information on additional desirable features, resulting in a refined hardware/software design. In Phase II, a refinedset of devices will be buil, and tested in larger user groups, and finally, in a wide scale pilot test program. Next, a final design will be generated, and a pilot fabrication run will be completed to verify that the design i ready for manufacturing at launch. A parallel (non-SBIR) effort is underway to build relationships with, and educate patient advocacy groups and user groups about this system, as part of the commercialization strategy.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this fast-track application, we propose to develop a Computer Adaptive Test (CAT) to provide universal ongoing, continuous progress assessment data of critical reading skills to teachers of students in grades 4 to 8.The primary purpose of this assessment will be to facilitate a teacher&#039;s ability to provide differentiated instruction for all students in these grades, including student who struggle as well as student who excel. We will call this assessment Continuous Monitoring of Advanced Reading Skills (CMARS, pronounced SEE-mars).  During Phase I we propose to develop and program a large pool of items spanning the reading abilities of students in grades 4 to 8 that will allow us to measure growth in critical areas ofreading. The size of the item pool must be sufficiently large to allow students to be assessed monthly. To achieve the aims of Phase I, we will (a) develop a large item pool across each of 4 domains of reading including: Word Analysis, Fluency, Vocabulary, and Comprehension; (b) field test item delivery formats with middle grade students to ensure that students in this age group understand and can complete each task independently, as well ensure they find the tasks age appropriate, motivating, and engaging; and (c) program all CMARS items incorporating high quality graphics and animation and an engaging game like theme.  During Phase II we propose to complete CMARS as a CAT-driven CPM reading assessment tool with proven technical adequacy. To achieve this Phase II aims, we will: (a) conduct Item Response Theory (IRT) research on our pool of items by administering the entire pool of items via computer administration to a large number of middle grade students in order to determine item parameters, as well as and determine which items do not perform as intended and need to be culled from the item pool; (b) use the data collected from our IRT work, to program the items to an existing Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT); and (c) conduct an evaluation of the reliability, concurrent, and predicative validity of CMARS to other well established measures of reading.  At the completion of this Fast Track project, we will have (a) completed programming of all CMARS items subtests and, (b) assessed the psychometric qualities of our computer- administered measures by comparing them to already establish examiner-administered measures, (c) completed programming for data display and reporting information back to teachers and schools.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Reading failure constitutes not only an educational problem, but a social and public health problem as well. Specifically, low reading performance is the strongest predictor for a dropping-out of school. Consequently, dropouts are more than eight times as likely to be in jail or prison as high school graduates and nearly 70% of prison inmates score at the lowest two levels of literacy (below fourth grade) with 19% being completely illiterate (Lyon, 1997, 1998). Equally alarming is that poor reading portends adverse health disparities and outcomes including increased incidence of chronic illness, drug and alcohol abuse, risky sexual behavior, less than optimal use of preventive health services, difficulties accessing medical care, and difficulties understanding health risks (Lyon, 1997, 1998).",

Published research has demonstrated clinically relevant effects of perturbation of support surface training for both ACL-deficient and ACL-reconstructed populations for improving dynamic knee stability, particularly in females. The clinically available methods of delivering the desired perturbations are currently limited to static balance boards that are manually pushed or pulled by the physical therapist. These perturbations may not simulate real-life perturbations that would occur during walking or running.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Patient socket performance is a critical barrier to progress in rehabilitation, the most common source of patient dissatisfaction and part of a growing medical and socioeconomic problem. Poor socket performance is a greatly uncharacterized multi-factorial problem that leads to skin degeneration and patient discomfort (~75% of all patients). This proposal has a two-folded scope: (a) to combine two novel socket technologies (elevated vacuum-EV and variable volume VV system) in order to enable for the first time real-time controllability of socket elevated vacuum and socket internal volume, and (b) to evaluate its innovative socket prototype in a number of in- and out-of-lab clinical trials by introducing a universal SocketPerformance Index (SPI) parameter (that is experimentally verified) for reliable, non-patient specific socket device assessment. Thorough validation of the socket prototype system for very strenuous activities, robust feasibility studies will expand alongits entire structural and functional properties, including sensitivity, operability, safety and durability, and will be completed by functional tests in clinical trials in-and-out of the laboratory. The work proposed here will bring to the market horizona novel device (iSOCKET) and new methodologies that stem from years of collaboration of a cohort of companies and Academia. iSOCKET will enhance the autonomy of patients (improve on the time of continuous pain-free socket use, improve SPI as compared to competitive products) and will solve the long awaited challenges in socket performance associated with very strenuous activities. The iSOCKET device will evolve into an affordable, practical socket with real-time pressure/shear/stress relief capabilities. iSOCKET hopes to prove the new choice for preventative interventions whereas the proposed work will also deliver new clinical tools to support daily fitting, rehabilitation, and monitoring of lower limb prosthesis users.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Stiffness and alignment of ankle-foot orthoses (AFOs) should be tuned optimally to maximize their function. Improperly tuned AFO may induce joint pain, reduced ambulatory function, and increased medical complications for patients with stroke. Therefore, the relative quality of AFOs fit determined by its stiffness and alignment is of  paramount concern in the daily lives of patients ambulating with an AFO. However, no clinical tool is currently available that can objectively guide orthotists to tune the AFO. This has led frequent mismatches between the needs of the patient and the delivered orthosis. The objective of the proposed work is to develop a novel system for AFOs called the Computerized Orthotic Prescription System (COPS). COPS assists orthotists in tuning the AFO stiffness and alignment dynamically in patients with stroke. COPS consists of a diagnostic AFO, intuitive clinical software and a custom-made modular AFO. The diagnostic AFO and the clinical software areused to select optimal components for the custom-made modular AFO delivered to each patient. The diagnostic AFO allows fine- tuning of stiffness and alignment and monitors ankle joint moment and motion. The data will be wirelessly transferred to the computer and the clinical software will instruct how the stiffness and alignment of an AFO should be adjusted. Once the tuning of the diagnostic AFO is completed, the software recommends which components should be selected for the modular AFO. The COPS will give confidence to both orthotists and patients and also significantly reduce time for the iterative process of stiffness and alignment tuning of a AFO.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This project will develop a system that can assist and improve the prescription of ankle-foot orthoses (AFOs) for patients with stroke.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this proposal is to further optimize Sequencing By Synthesis (SBS) chemistry to power a highly-sensitive, low-cost, sequencing system for clinical diagnostic sequencing called PinPoint MINI. A single human exome at 30 x coverage will be sequenced on this system for less than  150 on an instrument that will sell for under  70,000. The system can run 1-20 samples in parallel generating up to 20 million reads per sample with random sample access in the instrument. Currently, there is no other system on the market which would offer comparable features and performance. The simplicity of the proposed sample preparation and the low cost will enable human exome or targeted sequencing to be widely performed in theclinic and will lead to the revolution in healthcare. This Phase II project has two overall goals: 1) improving sequencing performance (read length and quality) 2) improve sequencing speed. High quality is important to produce more reliable and failsafe genetic diagnostic information and high speed is important to deliver results to physicians and patients quickly. During Phase 2, we will optimize the speed and performance to achieve at least 150 bp read length and reduces our current cycle time to 10 minutes. In addition, we will optimize our novel SBS-walking technology to achieve at least 300 (2 x 150) bp read lengths. Dr. Jeremy Edwards&#039;s at the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center will perform external validation for our sequencing chemistryand systems.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Ultimately, the ability to produce very inexpensive gene expression and detailed DNA sequence information related to cancer will lead for a much wider use of expression and sequence analyses for research and treatment of this devastating disease. In addition, the ability to analyze complex organisms&#039; genomes at a very low cost will both lead to accelerated discoveries throughout biology and provide the basis for Pharmacogenomics, a new paradigm in therapeutics wherein medicines are prescribed based on individual genotypes rather than just observed symptoms.",

Using internal funds, we are upgrading the Phase I device to become a field ready beta test device for placement into several sites. This will be a single channel device that is capable of inline selectionof 250 sequencing targets (average of 200BP long), sequence at 40X coverage, and variant calling in less than 2.5 hours of total run time. The Specific Aim of Phase II is to increase the throughput of this beta test single channel instrument to enable whole genome sequencing with high efficiency and accuracy for a cost of under  1000 per genome. To accomplish this Specific Aim, we will carry out seven Tasks:  Task 1: Develop a full-genome sequencing assay protocol for the preparation of a genomic DNA library for sequencing. Task 2: Develop a sensor configuration that can scale to 100s of channels.  Task 3: Develop a microfluidic device that can scale to 100s of channels  Task 4: Develop a method to read droplet sizes of ~10um  Task 5: Develop a sorting assay that sorts amplified DNA from empty drops  Task 6: Extend current informatics pipeline for resequencing a whole genome  Task 7: Extend current barcode clustering algorithms.  At the conclusion of Phase II, we will have a breadboard sequencing system thatwill be able to demonstrate that sequencing a whole genome in about six hours, including data analysis, genome alignment and variant calling, is fully achievable. The system will support reagent volumes that will meet the per run costs target lt  1000. Following Phase II, we expect to use internal funds to have a market ready product within one year.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  In Phase II of this project, we will scale the process we have completed in our Phase I to build a machine that will be able to sequence a human genome for less than  1000. This is a project to develop a user-friendly, desktop instrument that can sequence a person&#039;s entire genetic make-up in approximately 6 hours; the entire process will cost less than  1000, including analysis. By understanding a person&#039;s genetic make-up, researchers and physicians can use the information to make personalized decisions, thereby changing the healthcare landscape and improve healthcare costs and outcomes. This instrument will greatly enhance medical treatments for tens of millions of people around the world and greatly improve our ability to understand how the body functions, which could lead to major breakthroughs in medicine.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This competitive renewal SBIR proposal extends our current Phase II translational research on novel synthetic lipid/peptide lung surfactants containing the highly active Super Mini-B (S-MB) peptide incorporating crucialfunctional regions of human surfactant protein (SP)-B, the most active apoprotein in biologic surfactant. Our initial Phase II grant focused on S-MB synthesized by solid-state chemistry, and documented the high activity of synthetic Minisurf   surfactantcontaining solid-state S-MB combined with lipids. This renewal application continues the commercial development of Minisurf   surfactant. This proposal will scale-up the production of the S-MB peptide and the Minisurf   surfactant product, develop effective QA/QC methods for analyzing the S-MB peptide and Minisurf   surfactant product, and demonstrate biological equivalency to laboratory research scale batches of Minisurf   surfactant. Pilot lots of the Minisurf   surfactant product will be manufactured andteste to ensure that the process is robust, the analytical controls are appropriate and the efficacy is maintained. Samples from selected pilot lots of Minisurf   surfactant will be placed on stability and sent to a contractor to conduct GLP-compliant pharmacology and toxicology studies. The proposal also provides for active consultation with the FDA during the grant to facilitate successful IND preparation. Successful execution of these activities will lead to the development of a novel, commercially-attractive Minisurf   synthetic surfactant product having significant advantages in manufacturing economy, activity, and inhibition resistance over current animal and synthetic surfactant drugs.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This SBIR competitive renewal grant will continue the development of a synthetic exogenous lung surfactant product having significant advantages in manufacture, activity and inhibition resistance compared to current drugs. This innovative surfactant product is expected to have great future utility in treating patients with severe acute respiratory failure from the neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (NRDS), clinical acute lung injury (ALI), and the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The synthetic surfactant in this grant canalso potentially be used in novel delivery systems for other pulmonary therapeutic agents such as antibiotics, anti-inflammatory drugs, or genetic materials (gene therapy).",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Traumatic injury and hypovolemic shock are leading causes of death in children worldwide. Rapid, large volume crystalloid infusion and positive intrathoracic pressure ventilation resuscitation strategies often increasemorbidity and mortality following hemorrhage. Augmenting negative intrathoracic pressure, even without fluid resuscitation, improves hemodynamic parameters and outcome in adult porcine hemorrhagic shock. Vascular biology, physiology, and tissue injury mechanisms change as the child matures from infancy through adolescence, and are distinctly different from adults. The optimal method to restore intravascular volume, prevent secondary organ damage, and prevent progression of reversible shock to irreversible circulatory collapse following severe blood loss in children is no known. Our central hypothesis is that use of intrathoracic pressure regulation (IPR), enhances negative intrathoracic pressure and thus will augment preload, improve cardiac output, enhancecerebral oxygenation, and delay or prevent the progression of reversible shock to irreversible circulatory collapse for infants and children. IPR therapy works by regulating intrathoracic pressures in non-breathing patients. It lowers intrathoracic pressures to subatmospheric levels (-5 to -12 cmH2O) after each positive pressure ventilation. Lowering intrathoracic pressure draws venous blood back to the heart and lowers intracranial pressure, thereby increasing systemic and cerebral perfusion. Cerebral perfusion is increased by decreased intracranial resistance to forward blood flow secondary to higher cardiac output. This novel therapy uses an external vacuum source to lower intrathoracic pressure and a switch to allow for intermittent positive pressure ventilation, as needed. The negative intrathoracic pressure is carefully titrated  to optimize benefit with no evidence of harm to date. Building upon the successful Phase 1 studies that demonstrated improved 24 hour neurological survival when utilizing IPR technology in a pediatric porcine hemorrhage model, we propose to evaluate this innovative therapy in a carefully controlled clinical study in the pediatric population and measure key physiological variables including brain tissue oxygen levels. Specifically, the investigators propose to: 1) complete the development of and 510k clear an enhanced, miniaturized pediatric specific version of IPR therapy with variable vacuum levels that is housed in the expiratory limb of a standard ventilation circuit to be utilized in a clinical study, and 2) demonstrate proof of concep that application of intrathoracic pressure regulation (IPR) therapy will result in an increase in cardiac index in pediatric patients: a) with sepsis or b) who have undergone cardiac surgery forcongenital heart disease (CHD) (single ventricle or tetralogy of Fallot). IPR resuscitation strategy has the potential to successfully combat hypovolemic shock and circulatory collapse, the most common cause of morbidity and mortality in children worldwide.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Trauma-induced hemorrhagic shock is the leading cause of hypotension in both children and adults. Multi-system trauma accounts for 50% of deaths occurring in children, most often from blunt trauma with severe hypovolemia progressing to circulatory collapse (CDC Vital Statistics 2003). For every pediatric patient that dies as a result  of trauma, there are four survivors who are permanently disabled (approximately 100,000/year in the USA). Regardless of the etiology, intractable cardiovascular collapse continues to be a significant clinical challenge, especially in critically ill patients despite traditional fluid resuscitation and vasopressor agents. The main objective of this Phase 2 proposal is to provide proof of concept evidence in a carefully designed clinical study that application of intrathoracic pressure regulation (IPR) therapy will result in an increase in cardiac index and cerebral oxygenation in pediatric patients: a) with sepsis or b) who have undergone cardiac surgery for congenital heart disease (CHD) (single ventricle or tetralogy of Fallot). New approaches to treatment for this common medical emergency have the potential to reduce the high morbidity and mortality rates associated with severe hypotension. As such, this new device has the potential to be an important new advance in treating life-threatening hypotension and thereby reduce pediatric morbidity and mortality rates.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   ClotFoam(R)  , is a novel adhesive sealant composition and second-generation hemostatic agent. This biological agent was designed to arrest moderate to severe blood loss arising from intracavitary traumatic injury orintraoperative hemorrhage without compression, stitches or staples. Control of Intraoperative hemorrhage in laparoscopic surgery-which is increasingly becoming a suitable alternative to open surgery-can be extremely difficult, and often results in conversion to open laparotomy. Intraoperative hemorrhage during liver resection and other laparoscopic procedures remain a major risk which affects both immediate and long-term results. There is no available non-compressible product to control hemorrhage in casesof high-volume intraoperative bleeding in laparoscopic procedures. Therefore, a non- compressible hemostatic control in laparoscopic surgery will result in reduction of blood loss, postoperative pain, hospital stay and complications following these procedures.  Also, there are no available hemostatic products for use in trauma outside the operating room. Hemorrhage, resulting from traumatic injuries, is a major cause of death in accidents, and the primary cause of death on the battlefield. Over 40% of the trauma cases admitted at hospitals in the United States is due to road traffic accidents. Hemorrhage is the primary cause of death on the battlefield in conventional warfare. The vast majority of these deaths occur before the injured can be transported to atreatment facility. Tissue adhesives and sealants have been developed to control bleeding; but, since all existing haemostatic agents for abdominal intracavitary bleeding are designed to be used in the operating room- not in an emergency at the site of accident or in the battlefield-hemorrhage is often fatal. With early and effective hemorrhage control, more lives can be saved than by any other measure.  Proof of concept studies supported by the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute and by the Departmentof Defense (DARPA and the U.S. Army) in the swine model, have established the remarkable sealing properties of the agent. ClotFoam employs a new technology that bypasses the traditional mixture in situ of thrombin and fibrinogen, which translates in greater clotting efficacy and safety. The agent&#039;s competitive advantages over available technologies include a wide range of applications and uniqueness for use in cases of high-volume bleeding, and its rapid effect. ClotFoam(R) is also a plasmin-depleted aprotinin-and-thrombin-free fibrin sealant presenting no risk of autoimmune reaction to blood products. ClotFoam&#039;s fibrin components can be stored in a refrigerator at 40C ready-to-use. There is no need to unfreeze, mix or dissolve the components. Unlike otherfibrin sealants, it does not present a risk of thrombin self-cleavage and fibrinogen proteolytic degradation, which can severely reduce the efficacy of the agent over time. Its production costs are much lower than available fibrin sealants.  GLP preclinical studies by the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute have compared the hemostastic effect of ClotFoam against GelFoam (Pfizer), without compression or sutures in three surgical protocols producing moderated to severe venous and arterial bleeding. The study has established the efficacy and safety of the agent, and produced the necessary data to submit an Investigational New Drug Application (IND) to the Food and Drug Administration, toward the conduction of clinical trials.  The goal of this project is to conduct clinical trials with the non-compressible hemostatic agent ClotFoam(R) as required by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), for advancing the development of the sealant toward Biologic License as a general hemostatic. The research strategy to obtain approval for ClotFoam(R) as a general non-compressible hemostatic agent is to establish efficacy and safety in three distinct protocols that cover different body organs and tissues as well as applications. These protocols include: laparoscopic partial nephrectomy, laparoscopic liver resection and post-traumatic (hemodynamically stable and non-coagulopathic), spleen laceration. Significance: The proposed technology will significantly improve the treatment of civilian and military trauma injuries related to peritoneal hemorrhage, allow safe evacuation of the injured to definitive-care centers, and reduce casualties of combat. It will allow for expanding the use of minimally-invasive surgical procedures and provide a method to stop bleeding in laparoscopic surgery. ClotFoam(R) could have an important impact in emergency medicine, trauma and surgery, as well as a substantial share of the   1,7 billion a year U.S. projected market for second-generation surgical sealants. The core fibrin component technologydeveloped by our company could be used by other surgical sealant and wound healing products manufacturers, considerably expanding the option for the treatment of blood loss and wound healing. Substantial economic activity will be generated from the globalprovision of this core component.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: ClotFoam(R) is a novel adhesive sealant composition designed to stop moderate to severe blood loss arising from traumatic injury or intraoperative hemorrhage without need of compression. Achieving hemostasis as primary treatment without need of compression is essential for treating traumatic wounds, and facilitates the use of laparoscopic procedures. The control of hemorrhage in laparoscopic surgery-which is increasingly becoming a suitablealternative to open surgery-can be extremely difficult; and it often results in conversion to open surgery. This technology addresses important unmet needs, as there are no available products to control hemorrhage in cases of high volume intraoperative bleeding without the use of compression. A non-compressible hemostatic control in laparoscopic surgery will result in the reduction of blood loss, postoperative pain, hospital stay and complications following these procedures. Nor are there available such hemostatic products for use in trauma outside the operating room. Hemorrhage, resulting from traumatic injuries, is a major cause of death in accidents, and the primary cause of death on the battlefield. Over 40% of the trauma cases admitted at hospitals inthe United States is due to road traffic accidents. The vast majority of these deaths occur before the injured could be transported to a treatment facility. Various types of tissue adhesives and sealants have been developed to control bleeding; but none ofapproved sealants are designed to be used as primary treatment without need of sutures or stitches, or in cases of moderate to severe bleeding. All existing haemostatic agents for abdominal intracavitary hemorrhage have been developed for minor bleeding in the operating room-not in an emergency at the site of accident or in the battlefield, where hemorrhage is often fatal. With early and effective hemorrhage control, more lives can be saved than by any other measure. The agent ClotFoam has remarkable sealing properties, and competitive advantages over available technologies. Unlike other fibrin sealants, it is effective as a primary treatment and reduces the use of sutures-saving time, and facilitating minimally-invasive surgical procedures. The agent doesnot present a risk of immunological reactions; it is safe and its production costs are lower. The goal of the project is to conduct clinical trials with  the novel hemostatic agent, ClotFoam, as required by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for advancing the development of ClotFoam toward Biologic License as a general hemostatic. The strategy to obtain approval for ClotFoam as a general non- compressible hemostatic agent is to establish its efficacy and safety in three distinct protocols that cover different body organ and tissues; as well as in applications.

Substantial income and economic activity will be generated by the technology as well of the core fibrin component, which could be used by other fibrin sealants and wound product manufacturers all over the world.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION: In the medical device industry, silicone oil is a ubiquitous lubricant used in the manufacture, assembly of medical components, and also as the terminal lubricant for proper device operation. In prefilled syringes, problems arise when micro-droplets of silicone oil migrate  into the drug medium and act as a contaminant which can potentially react with the packaged drug. In the case of biological drugs, silicone oil contamination has been implicated in protein conformational changes and aggregation where even a small fraction of aggregated proteins can reduce biological activity and/or result in undesirable immunogenicity.  Glass syringes for prefilled applications predominantly use silicone oil as a lubricant. A silicone-free glass prefilld device is highly desired, but acceptance of a new lubricant requires stability testing with various  pharmaceutical ingredients, as well as particulate and force testing after extended storage. TriboFilm Research, Inc. proposes the development of their TriboGlide(R) silicone-free lubrication system for use in glass prefilled syringes. The TriboGlide(R) technology is based on perfluoropolyether chemistry and gas plasma immobilization to create a lubricating coating that is resistant to migration and leads to less lubricant extraction into the drug product.  In Phase I  TriboFilm Research demonstrated a proof-of-concept for a silicone-free glass prefilled syringe. In collaboration with the University of Colorado at Denver, the superior performance of TriboGlide(R)versus Silicone Oil was demonstrated with respect to protein aggregation and syringe extrusion forces. In Phase II, a scalable manufacturing process for producing TriboGlide(R) coated glass syringes will be developed. Initially, the TriboGlide(R) lubrication process will be optimized using a design of experiments to produce coatings with low syringe extrusion forces and low particle counts. Particles will be measured using light obscuration (HIAC) as well as microflow imaging to determine the number of particles present and distinguish between lubricant particles and aggregated proteins. With an optimized coating process, protein stability will be evaluated using various therapeutic proteins. The TriboGlide(R) lubrication system will be compared to SiliconeOil to establish superiority of the lubrication process. Protein stability will be examined using fluorescence spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and microflow imaging. Finally, a pilot scale lubrication machine will be built to demonstrate the scale-up andmanufacturability of this process.  The medical device and pharmaceutical industries have long desired a completely silicone-free syringe system that does not affect the stability of the packaged drug in solution. If successful, TriboGlide(R) will be thefirst universal silicone-free system for glass prefilled syringes with applications extending to other fields.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Patient controlled self-therapy is an enticing factor for packaging drugs in single-dose prefilled syringe formats which treat chronic ailments, such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and diabetes. Other advantages of prefilled syringes include reduction in medical errors, ease of use, accurate dosage, elimination of preservatives, and reduction in theamount of drug overfill required when pharmaceutical products are packaged in vials or ampoules. Silicone oil, which serves as a lubricant for easy operation of the syringe, can contaminate the drug product and adversely interact with sensitive pharmaceutical products. The proposed TriboGlide(R) system will be the first silicone-free system for glass prefilled syringes that overcomes the problems of lubricant migration and drug contamination.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ZetrOZ has developed a prototype novel, miniature, portable, high-power, ultrasound system for would healing. Wound healing is a major clinical issue, and can present significant clinical challenges both when wounds areacute--occurring due to trauma, burns, surgery, or due to more chronic health problems. Wound healing is an intricate fibroproliferative response to repairs damaged tissue following injury. This process is fragile and susceptible to interruption or failure, leading to non-healing wounds. Historically, wounds have been historically treated in a sub-optimal fashion with basic wound care products designed to cover wounds and absorb exudates. Ultrasound (a safe, commonly used, FDA-approved treatment modality)has been shown to have beneficial effects on factors associated with tissue healing in both in vitro and in vivo animal models, including promotion of histamine release, angiogenesis, and collagen deposition (thereby increasing wound breaking strength), and ultimately results in a reduction in wound size. Although ultrasound therapy has been previously demonstrated to accelerate wound healing, conventional techniques utilize shorter bursts of high-intensity treatments. Such treatment is typically limited toadministration by a medical provider. In contrast to current technologies, our device significantly reduces the size, cost, and power requirements of ultrasound therapy when compared to traditional ultrasound devices. The system can deliver therapeutic acoustical energy waves at lower voltages than those in conventional ultrasound systems. During this project we aim to demonstrate that a human wearable low intensity therapeutic ultrasound system enhances wound healing. This will be accomplished through testing the system on a single battery charge in an animal cadaver. We will also demonstrate that low intensity therapeutic ultrasound improves wound healing, as measured by therapy on the rate and extent of epithelialization and granulation tissue formation(the major components in human wound healing) in wild-type and diabetic murine excisional wound models. The proposed experiments will investigate two different power levels to further understand impact of intensity on would healing.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will benefit public health by developing an interactive training system for emergency medical technicians (EMTs).  By improving the accuracy, engagement, and realism of EMT training exercises, we will help to improve EMT skills overall and thereby provide better emergency care to the general public.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Currently, more than 60 % of end-stage renal diseases patients who require chronic hemodialysis are accessed through a native arteriovenous fistula (AVF) or synthetic graft (AVG). Unfortunately, primary failure rates were as high as 60 % at 6 months after AVF creation and 77% at 1 year after AVG construction. Surgical  trauma, repeated needle punctures, mechanical shear stress, the foreign graft material and uremia can elicit a  strong thrombotic response that lays downa mural fibrin- and platelet-rich substrate on which excessive cell  migration,  proliferation  and  matrix  deposition  occur,  leading  to  neointimal  hyperplasia  (NH)  in  the  peri-anastomotic  regions  of  AVFs  and  AVGs.  Limiting the early eventof mural thrombosis may thus effectively reduce NH, which is the primary cause of stenosis and subsequent dialysis access failure. Currently  available  antiplatelet  and  anticoagulant  drugs,  however,  have  inadequate  efficacies  in  preventing  NH  at  clinically  safe  doses.  EVAS  Therapeutics  has  developed  two  thrombogenic  site-targeted  fusion  Proteins  (ANV-6L15 and TAP-ANV), which can specifically dock onto the membrane surfaces of thrombogenic cells  and passivate the membrane-associatedenzyme/cofactor complexes that initiate and propagate the clotting  cascade. Due to their high-affinity thrombogenic site-targeting properties and relatively short circulating half-lives, the fusion  proteins  can exert long-lasting antithrombotic effectwithout systemic anticoagulation. This  may  eliminate the need for long-term antithrombotic therapy and inhibit mural thrombosis more effectively with  reduced risks of bleeding. The main objective of this proposal is to develop these promising drug candidates  for prevention of NH and improving the function and survival of AVGs. If successful, this strategy can be  applied to AVFs. The specific aims of the phase II proposal are: Specific aim 1: Establish pilot-scale processes  for  production  of  ANV-6L15  and  TAP-ANV.  A  bench  process  developed  in  phase  I  will  be  adapted  for  pilot-scale production of the recombinant proteins. Specific aim 2: Examine therapeutic efficacies of TAP-ANV  and ANV-6L15 in porcine hemodialysis vascular access models. Both NH formation and lumen patency will be  examined using a porcine arteriovenous polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) graft (AVG) model.    Currently  there  are  no  effective  therapies  to  improve  hemodialysis  arteriovenous  access  longevity.  Through  this  study  we  may  provide  a  novel  and  simple  therapeutic  intervention  to  improve  longevity  of  hemodialysis PTFE AVGs and AVFs. Results from this study will also provide critical data for IND filing and  further clinical development.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Performance of hemodialysis procedure requires a functional vascular access which often fails within  one year.

The ultimate goal of this Phase IIB proposal is to further advance SelG1 into Phase II/III safety and efficacy trials to support of regulatory filings for FDA approval and commercialization. Previous work funded in part by an NHLBI SBIR Fast Track award R44HL093893, and Selexysfinancing, resulted in the completion of studies to determine the pharmacology/toxicology of SelG1 in cynomolgus monkey, filing the SelG1 IND with the FDA and the completion of a Phase I safety and PK/PD normal volunteer study. The final audited Phase I study report will be submitted to the IND in Q1 2012. The aims of this proposal are directed to the conduct and analysis of a Phase II clinical efficacy and safet study to evaluate SelG1 as a therapeutic treatment for sickle cell patients. Sickle cell disease (SCD) affects over 90,000 individuals in the US and remains a debilitating condition with major unmet medical need leading to high morbidity and mortality. Selexys is developing SelG1 as a once monthly IV infusion for the prevention or reduction of vasoocclusive crisis and associated morbidities in sickle cell patients. The company has engaged in planning with key opinion leaders (KOLs) in the SCD field to develop a clinical protocol for SelG1 to be conducted in a Phase II safety and efficacy trial in approximately 120 SCD patients, powered to gt88% for the validated primary endpoint of sickle cell crisis reduction. The planned study would be a 12- month double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled 3-arm study with two SelG1 dosing arms. The manufacturing plan is set to commence in Q1 2012 with GMP production of SelG1 at the 500-1000L scale at Cytovance Biologics in Oklahoma City. Patient recruitment and conduct of the study is projected to commence in Q2-Q3 of 2012 with an overall study duration of 18-24months. The funds requested in this PhIIB renewal application are for support of conduct and management of the clinical program, bioanalytical assays, and analysis of the clinical trial results. It is anticipated that successful completion of the Phase IIstudy will lead to a pivotal Phase III safety and efficacy trial with the goal of registration, FDA approval and launch of SelG1 for the treatment of vasoocclusive crisis in sickle cell patients.

Sickle cell disease s a devastating, inherited blood disorder that affects over 90,000 persons, primarily African-Americans, in the U.S and vasoocclusive crisis is the leading cause of morbidity, mortality and health care cost in these patients. Thus, if successful, SelG1 could address a critical unmet medical need for this rare, debilitating orphan disease, which currently lacks a safe and effective  treatment for many patients.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project is designed to develop novel catechol-functionalized polymers for medical device coatings with increased lubricity and biocompatibility. Catechols have been shown to be key components in the adhesive proteins that mussels secrete to attach to underwater surfaces. The catechol has a number of different non-covalent bond interactions which serve to increase adherence of catechol-functionalized molecules to both organic and inorganic substrates. This ability will be utilized to create coatings that adhere to previously difficult-to-coat medical device materials such as silicone, PEBAX- 72 and HDPE, opening the way to enhanced device properties for these materials. In Phase I, catechols were incorporated by synthesizing a catechol monomer and copolymerizing with vinyl pyrrolidone, a commonly used hydrogel coating for increasing the slipperiness of a coating. While catechols had previously been attached to other polymers, they have been limited primarily to poly(ethylene glycol). The innovation in this proposal lies in the development of catechol-functionalized polymers for improved lubricity coatings for medical devices. In Phase II, the catechol-functionalized polymers will be optimized, applied to two commercialmedical devices (cardiovascular radial introducer and a cerebrospinal shunt) that lack adherent coatings, and expanded to include hemocompatible, passivating, and non-oxidant reliant copolymers.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal will develop coatings for medical devices to increase slipperiness and compatibility with the body. It targets specific materials used in the device fabrication which are difficult to coat with a novel approach inspired by mussels. These mussel- inspired coatings shouldallow easier insertion of medical devices with less tissue injury and pain. The proposal specifically targets a cardiovascular device (radial introducer) and a neurological device (cerebrospinal shunts). Improved medical devices will improve patient comfort and health.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Acute myocardial infarction is the leading cause of death in most industrialized nations. The estimated annual incidence in the US is 865,000 events, with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI, severe AMI)comprising an estimated 500,000 events per year. Fibrinolytic therapy is widely utilized to restore coronary blood flow due to its widespread availability to the broad cross-section of patients. The current regimen, including tissue plasminogen activator,aspirin, clopidogrel and heparin, still induces inadequate coronary reperfusion in 30-40% of patients and early thrombotic reocclusion in 5-10% patients. Moreover, successful recanalization causes detrimental reperfusion injury that accounts for up to 50%of the final size of a myocardial infarct. Net clinical adverse outcomes remain 10-12% at 30 days after treatment and 16-17% STEMI patients die during 1-year follow-up. Moreover, both morbidity and mortality are dramatically increased in patients experiencing peri-procedure bleeding. Importantly, most of the recurrent MI and major bleeding events occur in the first hours and days after treatment. Consequently, the search for more efficacious and safer acute antithrombotic agents with effective attenuation of reperfusion injury remains the   holy grail&#039; of drug development.  APT102 is an optimized human apyrase with two amino acid substitution that has significantly higher activity than the wild-type apyrases. This enzyme inhibits platelet activation and limits vascular inflammation by enzymatically hydrolyzing extracellular ADP and ATP. Adenosine is further generated by CD73 which prevents tissue damage during hypoxia and in the setting of cardiac reperfusion injury. In addition, APT102 prevents platelet desensitization and maintains homeostasis. With the Phase I award, we demonstrated that in the r-tPA induced fibrinolysis model in dogs, treatment of APT102 completely prevented re-occlusion, maintained normal blood flow, and profoundly reduced infarct size ofhearts by 80% compared with clopidogrel. Meanwhile, APT102 did not prolong bleeding time, as did clopidogrel. The goal of this Phase II SBIR grant application is to rigorously determine whether in the coronary fibrinolysis model in dogs, APT102 promotes improved myocardial perfusion and left ventricular function with minimal bleeding compared with clopidogrel. The long-term goal is to develop APT102 as a highly effective antithrombotic and anti-inflammatory therapy with minimal bleeding risk that will profoundly improve efficacy and safety of acute treatment for AMI and other thrombotic patients.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The goal of this Phase II SBIR grant application is to rigorously determine whether in the coronary fibrinolysis model in dogs,APT102 promotes improved myocardial perfusion and left ventricular function with minimal bleeding compared with clopidogrel.",

This process will minimize the process control difficulties and high reject rates associated with [conventional electropolishing of stents using mixed high concentration acid electrolytes, including sulfuric, phosphoric, hydrofluoric and perchloric acids. The presence of strong acids presents a serious issue in terms of surface contamination and worker exposure. Furthermore, the lack of robustness of the current electropolishing process resultsin high stent reject rates, approaching 40- 50%.] Compared to conventional electropolishing, FARADAYIC ElectroPolishing will provide a uniformly smooth surface using a simple 17 wt% sulfuric acid electrolyte. The specific aims of the Phase II effort are to optimize the [ElectroPolishing process], transition to an  -scale pilot manufacturing apparatus, and work with our industrial collaborators to prepare this technology for full-scale industrial implementation. The measures of merit for the Phase II project will include: [1) surface  finish, based on industrial stent specifications, 2) polishing rate, 3) dimensional tolerance, and ) corrosion resistance]. Faraday will be assisted by Dr. Lyle Zardiackas and Dr. Michael Roach of the University of MississippiMedical Center. The proposed project meets the NIH mission by developing an innovative stent manufacturing process with the overall aim of addressing technological innovation in the U.S. manufacturing economy consistent with Executive Order   Encouraging Innovation in Manufacturing  .

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project consists of the research and development of a unique implantable ischemia monitor that uses subcutaneous sensors in the patient&#039;s torso to detect the onset of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Upon detecting a heart attack, the monitor generates an alarm, which enables the patient to promptly seek medical treatment. In the United States, the median symptom-to-hospital time is 2.4 hours. Lengthy delays between symptom onset and a patient&#039;s arrival at a hospital cause both substantial heart tissue damage and many deaths. Approximately 50% of heart attack patients have either atypical or no symptoms at all, causing significant delays in treatment. Each 30 minute reduction of treatment delay provides a 7.5% decrease in mortality and 8.7% decrease in the incidence of congestive heart failure. Prompt treatment of AMIs enabled by real-time ischemia monitoring and alerting will save lives and decrease morbidity. In 2010, approximately 1.4 million people in the UnitedStates will have heart attacks, and approximately 400,000 of these victims will die. A chronically implanted monitor that provides early warnings of heart attacks could greatly reduce time to treatment, which in turn will dramatically decrease heart-attack related deaths and improve the quality of life of heart attack survivors. This monitor will be an important health care advance since coronary heart disease is the top cause of death in the U.S. and one of the leading costs to the healthcare system. ThisPhase II research builds upon our successful Phase I work, which entailed the development and evaluation of an ischemia detection algorithm using a small patient population. This Phase II project will result in the creation of a monitor that is ready fora clinical safety trial. This goal will be realized by achieving the following aims: Aim 1. Demonstrate the efficacy of an algorithm that will run within an implantable device that utilizes two subcutaneous vectors. In this aim, we will evaluate and refinethe Phase I algorithm by testing it on two datasets. The first dataset will include Holter recordings from a control group of 36 high-risk individuals who will be monitored for approximately 2 weeks (no ischemia detections should occur in this group). Thesecond dataset will include 24-hour, 12- lead recordings from hundreds of cases of confirmed AMIs. Aim 2 Demonstrate the functionality of the entire monitoring system, including the implantable device, the physician&#039;s programmer that remotely programs theimplantable device in situ, and the subcutaneous lead. To further the achievement of this aim, the algorithm will be implemented within a new implantable hardware platform. Successful completion of this aim will be shown when the entire system passes alltests required to obtain United States Food and Drug Administration approval for a clinical safety trial.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Heart attacks are the leading cause of death in the United States. Early detection of heart attacks by an implantablemonitor will help to save lives and improve heath of survivors.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT  Rapid, high-throughput, and highly accurate identification of potential blood borne diseases will help blood banks to quickly test a very large volume of donated blood, and will help to prevent further infections. Current blood testing has the following issues:   1. Time consuming testing and sample operation that must be performed for all diseases   one-by-one  .   2. A large sample volume is required that depends on the number of tests.   3. Testing procedure is complicated as the number of tests increase.   4. Complicated operational procedures that must be run by highly trained personnel in molecular laboratories.     The recent development of commercially-available assays using nucleic acid amplification test technologies (NAT) have made it possible for blood centers to consider applying these tests to blood donor screening. But NAT test systems, so far, are time intensive, not in   multiplexed (gt 2) fashion  , thus are unsuited to large-scale screening of donor samples for various pathogens.Maxwell Sensors, Inc. (MSI) proposes to combine Helicase-Dependent Amplification and Barcode Magnetic Bead (BMB) technologies to produce a rapid, Simultaneous Assay for Multiple Pathogens in Blood (SAMP-B). With a few drops of a donor&#039;s blood combined with digital magnetic beads in a single microwell, it is possible to simultaneously identify HIV type 1 and 2, Hepatitis B (HBV), Syphilis, Hepatitis C (HCV), Human T-Lymphotropic Virus (HTLV type I and II), West Nile Virus (WNV), and many other blood-bornediseases. During this Phase I project, we have completed all tasks and successfully demonstrated the technical feasibility of simultaneous assay for multiple pathogens by fabricating 128-plex BMBs, integrating the analyzer, and performing HIV, HBV, and Syphilis multiplexed assays. The resulting combined technology is very powerful and will offer the following advantages:    (1) Small quantity of sample: a few drops of blood in a microwell are all that&#039;s needed to identify multiple target pathogens. It  notonly determines a reactive sample, but also identifies   reactive to what     (2) Reduced window period: offers high sensitivity and specificity without the   window period   associated with antibody based screening technologies   (3) Rapid and high throughput: the system can automatically process up to 100 samples per hour - for a maximum of 12,800 reportable results in a 96-microwell format   (4) Flexibility: easy addition of new probes for additional screening targets on beads   (5) Low cost, easy to use, and high reliability: BMB are low cost, simple operation steps, and batch to batch variation is minimal.     In this Phase II project, we will focus on: (1) expand blood-borne pathogens panels from (3-plex to 8-plex) for Blood screening, (2) integrate the sample process with SAMP-B analyzer, and (3) develop and evaluate multiplex pathogens for blood screening.",

        "abstract": "Project Summary/Abstract  Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality for both men and women, accounting for nearly 40% of annual deaths. High levels of LDL-C and low levels of HDL-C are well-known risk factors for heart disease. Although lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels using a number of marketed drugs, of which statins are the leading drugs, has significantly reduced coronary artery disease, substantial residual cardiovascular risk remains, even with very aggressive reductions in levels of LDL-C. Accordingly, attention is now shifting toward strategies for targeting HDL-C as adjunctive therapy to prevent and treat cardiovascular disease. Many studies have emphasized that the risk factor associatedwith low levels of HDL-C is independent of that of high LDL-C. Recent epidemiological data confirmed that patients with low HDL-C level are at high risk of premature cardiovascular disease no matter how low the LDL-C level. These and other patients will dramatically benefit from an aggressive treatment of low HDL-C. The long-term goal of the proposed studies is to develop novel drugs for increasing HDL-C. Our therapeutic target is endothelial lipase (EL), a member of the lipoprotein lipase gene family thathydrolyzes HDL-C phospholipids. Recent studies demonstrated that inhibition of EL in mice results in a significant increase in HDL-C levels. In Phase I, we have identified selective inhibitors of EL and developed preliminary SAR. As part of this Phase II proposal, we plan to expand and optimize our hits, and confirm the ability of selected compounds to increase the HDL-C level using in vivo animal models.",

In 2005 over 8.1 million Americans had an MI; 30% died before reaching hospital and 10% died after hospitalization. It is the 70% whoreach hospital that we believe we can help - a million lives in the balance and an improved quality of life for millions more - in the US alone. The goal of these studies is to bring a novel therapeutic approach to myocardial infarction (MI) and ischemia-reperfusion (IR) wound healing to the clinic. The approach is both strikingly effective and exactly contrary to conventional wisdom. In a murine model we have shown that temporary depletion of dendritic cells (DC) during MI wound healing results in an 80%improvement in cardiac function and a 65% reduction in MI size. Cardiac function is the greatest determinant of survival post-MI. We will continue the development of this seminal discovery into a human therapy by completing preclinical murine safety and efficacy testing in our proprietary transgenic (TG) mouse model. The product is a human mannose receptor (hMR) targeted fusion protein designed to deplete DC post-MI. The previously unrecognized role for DC in MI wound healing is noteworthy for at least tworeasons. First, immunologists and cardiologists have conventionally thought that depletion of DC post-MI would result in catastrophe: i.e. weakened tissues (cardiac rupture) and no new vasculature. Second, the beneficial effect of DC depletion is startlingin its magnitude (up to 80% improvement in heart function vs. controls). A treatment that temporarily depletes DC is nothing short of a paradigm shift that we believe will lead to a sharp reduction in mortality and profound improvements in the lives of patients. In Phase I, we demonstrated safety and efficacy of a hMR-targeted immunotoxin in a highly human- relevant murine model. In Phase II we will complete pre-clinical testing through rigorous dose optimization as well as safety and efficacy studies in murine models and human histology and blood work (in vitro). The compelling safety and efficacy results combined with the lack of a suitable second species means the work described herein is expected to be sufficient for a successful IND application. We areengaged in continuing discussions with both clinicians and the FDA regarding this pre-clinical path as well  as the design of a Phase I clinical trial. We will bring the drug to market in collaboration with or strategic partners. Initial results suggest that this strategy may lead to a sharp reduction in mortality and profound improvements in the lives of victims of MI.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Heart attacks are the leading cause of death in the developed world. By temporarily depleting a cell type commonly associated with inflammatory and immune responses, we have been able to dramatically improve heart function after a heart attack in mice. The overall goal of this project is to advance these results toward a drug that will help humans.",

Small molecule screens have been performed to identify modifiers of vascular patterning but this process has been performed at relatively low throughput since the tools for fully automated processing are not yet available. We propose to develop a novel, high-throughput screening assay for angiogenesis promoters. The assay would be based on the use of the SideView   microplate to collectclear images of the vascular pattern in animals that express GFP in their vasculature. During Phase I we: 1) developed novel methods to modulate angiogenesis promoters in the plexus; 2) developed software that locates the zebrafish, identifies the region of interest, and moves that region to the center of the field of view; and 3) developed automated, post-acquisition image processing software that distinguishes wild-type zebrafish embryos from xxx mutant embryos with deformities in the plexus.

However, a serious adverse outcome of late stent thrombosis in patients treated with DES has been reported, which leads to fatal heart attack and death even though it occurs at low rate. Thus, for safe and effective clinical use, a coronary stent needs to have better biocompatibility on its surface that will provide sufficient thrombo-resistance in addition to inhibiting cell proliferation thereby slowing down healing of tissues around the stent. Nanova, Inc. is developing a novel coating layer of high thrombo-resistance on the surface of metallic biomaterials of which coronary stents are made. An environmentally benign technology, low temperature plasma process is used to deposit an ultra-thin (nano-scale) but continuouslayer of coating, sufficient to generate desired abrasion resistance and immobilize the bioactive functional groups created in the subsequent plasma surface treatment to prevent blood clots and restenosis, but thin enough to allow for stent expansion without cracking when delivered into patients. The knowledge gained in this innovative research project will also benefit research and development for improved biocompatibility in other implantable medical devices such as pacemakers, pulse generators, cardiac defibrillators and bio-sensors.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vasculox, Inc. is developing a humanized anti-CD47 mAb for reducing ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) in organ transplantation. In spite of improvements in surgical technique, organ preservation and immunosuppression, IRI remains a serious limitation and is responsible for delayed graft function, initial graft failure and contribtes to poor long-term graft survival, thus representing an area of significant unmet medical need. Increasing nitric oxide (NO) signaling can provide a substantial therapeutic benefit in reducing IRI. The founders of Vasculox discovered that thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) binding to its receptor, CD47, limits NO signaling in all vascular tissues. Blocking TSP-1 binding with an anti-CD47 monoclonal antibody (anti-CD47 mAb) relieves this inhibition of NO signaling and improves outcomes in several animal models of IRI. We have recently demonstrated efficacy of an anti-CD47 mAb to improve liver function in an ex vivo perfusion model and in a rat liver transplant model. Vasculox has characterized a panel of 9 mouse monoclonal mAbs (400 series mAbs) that are unique in reacting broadly across species with human, rodent, dog and pig providing a significant advantage for clinical development. Three of these mAbs reverse the TSP1-CD47 mediated inhibition of NO-stimulated cGMP formation in cultured cells and one of these will be taken forward for humanization.  In this Phase II SBIR grant the specific aims are: Aim 1. Humanize the lead CD47 mAb candidate, produce research grade material for preclinical studies. Aim 2A. Establish optimal conditions for efficacy of CD47 mAb in a rat syngeneic liver transplant model including administration and dosing modality (pre-treat organ alone, treat recipient alone or treat both) and adjuvant treatments to enhance the NO signaling pathway (arginase inhibitors and/or L-arginine) Aim 2B. Demonstrate efficacy of the humanized mAb in a large animal (porcine) model of transplant using the optimized treatment modality as determined in Aim2A. Aim 3. Carry out non-GLP (preliminary) pharmacokinetic and safety studies in the rat and non-human primate using the CD47 humanized mAb to prepare for GLP IND-enabling studies.  This phase II proposal addresses several critical path milestones for Vasculox that will allow us to address transplant IRI as well as additional indications for anti-CD47 therapy including IRI arising from surgical procedures, trauma, sickle cell crisis and pulmonary hypertension.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) is a complicating factor in many cardiovascular diseases and surgical procedures including organ transplantation. Increasing nitric oxide (NO) signaling can provide a substantial therapeutic benefit in reducing IRI. The founders of Vasculox discovered that a receptor called CD47 limits NO signaling. Blocking CD47 with a monoclonal antibody (CD47mAb) relieves this inhibition of NO signaling and has the potential to enhance organ transplantation and save lives. Vasculox is developing a humanized CD47mAb for reducing IRI in organ transplantation that reacts with many different species. In this proposal we will humanize the lead CD47mAb candidate and determine its optimal dosing modality in rat liver transplantation. We will then confirm its efficacy in pigs, a more human-like species. Finally, we will conduct studies of how long the mAb is available in the circulation and test the CD47mAb for safety in two animal species as required by the FDA. These studies represent critical path milestones for Vasculox and must be accomplished before we can begin clinical trials to improve organ transplantation, allow for more transplantable organs and thereby save more lives.",

Conventional resuscitation fluids possess one or more limitations when compared to these ideal characteristics. The biocompatible, viscous, and oncotic biopolymer keratin is a potential solution to restore plasma volume while actually improving tissue oxygenation by recruitment of fluid into the vasculature and maintaining/improving hemodynamic parameters of microcirculation. The use of keratin in resuscitation fluids offers the potential to optimize a fluid that is compatible to the human circulatory microenvironment. Because of the flexible chemistry of keratin family of proteins, the physical, chemical, and biological properties of these materials can be controlled andoptimized. By using chemical extraction techniques to preserve molecular weight and by formulating fluids to specific viscosities and oncotic pressures, optimal resuscitation fluids can be obtained. Purification strategies of these keratin fluids developed at the Wake Forest School of Medicine and licensed to KeraNetics have resulted in a fluid technology that, in rodent models, has solved many of the challenges with alternative resuscitation fluids. This fluid is based on a biocompatible keratin-based system that can be tuned to the hemodynamic needs of victims of severe hemorrhage/shock without the potential for thrombotic events or tissue damage. The keratin analogs are inexpensive to obtain (keratins can be extracted from human hair, which can be acquired for less than  3 per pound), can be sterilized using conventional techniques, and are shelf and temperature stable. Therefore, they can be stored at ambient temperatures (up to 50 degrees Celsius). Thus, keratin-based resuscitation fluids are potentially an ideal colloidal-based fluid for use by first responders. Data from the Phase I project determined that a specially formulated resuscitation fluid now called by the trade- name KeraStat   is optimal and that this fluid has positive influence on hemodynamic recovery after hemorrhage/shock. Based on this data, we will test the hypothesis that KeraStat can restore normal cardiovascular performance and provide improved outcomes after hemorrhage/shock. This project will first examine the optimal keratin resuscitation fluid dosage/administration protocol in a rodent model. Using this protocol, we will then examine the effect of KeraStat on delayed treatment and long-term outcomes in a porcine model of trauma/hemorrhage/shock. These data will be instrumental indeveloping a preclinical data package to be submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration in support of clinical trials.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Despite the fact that traumatic injuries represent the fifth overall leading cause of death in the United States, there is no ideal fluid available on the market to address the need for resuscitation from traumatic hemorrhage and shock. In a Phase I SBIR project, KeraNetics developed a novel keratin-based resuscitation fluid that was shown to hemodynamically stabilize rats after as much as a 40% blood loss while overcoming many of the limitations of conventional resuscitation fluids. This proposal seeks to further develop a keratin resuscitation fluid, KeraStat  , and lay the groundwork for human clinical trials and commercialization of a potentially transformational technology through a focused program of preclinical research.",

        "abstract": "Each year, over 115,000 patients in the US need to have their diseased heart valves replaced with artificial devices. Although bioprosthetic valves are considered ideal, they wear out in about 15 years and are thus used primarily in the elderly who are notexpected to outlive the valve. Younger patients receive mechanical valves that are more durable, but require chronic anticoagulation. This makes participation in most sports impossible and exposes the patient to increased risk for fatal bleeds and strokes. VXi is developing a two-part heart valve consisting of a permanent base and a plug-in exchangeable bioprosthetic tissue leaflet set. The VXi device is thus a lifetime bioprosthetic valve system that does not require anticoagulation. As the leaflet set begins to show signs of wear it can be exchanged rapidly, using a minimally invasive off-pump, beating heart procedure. Rapid, minimally invasive leaflet exchange significantly reduces the duration of redo surgery and eliminates the need for the technicallydemanding and potentially dangerous re-excision of the initial prosthetic valve. As the leaflet set is exchanged, the docking station remains in place, avoiding disruption of the aortic root and the nearby conduction system of the heart. VXi has successfully developed prototypes of its valves and demonstrated their exchangeability in a chronic animal model. In this Fast Track application, we propose to develop (i) the tools and techniques for minimally invasive, off-pump, beating-heart surgery for heart valve replacement, and (ii) a fully transapical implant of the initial docking station. The tools for valve implant and leaflet exchange evolve from our existing open surgery tool set. Access to the valve through the apex will be by way of a novel collapsibleport technology pioneered by Dr. Gerard Guiraudon. Unlike conventional trocars, our introducer technology enables multiple tools to be inserted through a flexible cardiac port that enables a high degree of articulation, and rapid tool exchange. We proposeto develop the transapical docking station, the port and the exchange tool technology and evaluate their function in a series of acute and chronic valve exchange experiments in the juvenile sheep model.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is to develop a STAT palm-sized blood counter for monitoring complete blood counts (CBC) with 3-part differential during emergencies. Changes in blood counts can reflect acutely worsening medical conditions. For instance, a rapidly rising white blood cell count may occur during infections or a leukemic blast crises. Hematocrit values may rapidly decline in traumas, gastrointestinal bleeds, and post- procedure recoveries. Platelet values may dropsignificantly during chemotherapy and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. During these situations, close and frequent monitoring of a patient&#039;s blood counts is a must to deliver the best care and treatment, whether it be blood transfusions, platelet transfusions, or drug administrations. These clinical scenarios reflect a significant market need. In 2007,  2.7 billion of hematology tests were performed. Of these, an estimated 25-35% of these tests were STAT tests, which are ideally performed at the point-of-care. The proposed blood counter samples a fingerstick of blood from the patient and analyzes it in real-time at the patient&#039;s side for point-of-emergency clinical decision making. This is in contrast to today&#039;s measurement technologies, which require abenchtop instrument and a trained technician. The central hypothesis for this Phase II SBIR effort is this: microfluidic technology can be utilized to develop an integrated palm-sized blood counter that requires only a pinprick of blood. The proposed 24-month Phase II effort leverages our Phase I accomplishments in microfluidics, sensitive detection, and precision measurements to develop a prototype handheld emergency blood sensor. Advances in detection and microfluidics are required to develop such a device. Specific Aim 1 will utilize our microfluidics technology to assess serial cell dilution ad red cell lysis. Specific Aim 2 will be utilized to develop an integrated optical and electrical impedance detection system required for measurement of a wide range of cell parameters. Specific Aim 3 will be utilized to develop a handheld, breadboard prototype of our STAT blood counter and validate its performance against a gold-standard blood counter across a set of clinical samples. Success in Phase II will leadto a Phase III effort which will include detailed product engineering for a commercial STAT blood counter product, tests for FDA 510(k) approval, and commercialization. The resulting product can be utilized in a wide- range of settings including ambulances, inpatient rooms, operating rooms, medical offices, and resource- starved settings.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research is relevant to public health because rapid diagnosis of blood counts can be the difference between life and death. The palm-sized blood counter is designed to provide much needed medical information during critical emergencies.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The global burden of cancer doubled between 1975 and 2000. Cancer became the leading cause of death worldwide in 2010, and is projected to double again by 2020 and to triple by 2030. This horrible disease has touched each of us, and despite enormous investments in prevention and treatment, its impact continues to accelerate. Ideally, any cancer therapy should be effective (at killing cancerous cells), targeted (i.e. selective, to avoid killing healthy cells), and permanent (to avoid relapse and metastasis). Today&#039;s standards of care for most cancers fall short in some or all of these criteria. We have developed a novel therapy (chNKG2D T cells) that has met these marks in animal models through the use of the host&#039;s own immune cells. A patient&#039;s T-cells are modified to express chimeric NKG2D (chNKG2D) receptors, expanded, and then returned to the patient. We believe that this innovation will lead to a new class of therapies with remarkable potential, and we are actively developing it for therapy of several tumors including myeloma, lymphoma, and ovarian cancer. To date we have: demonstrated the ability to achieve 100% survival and 100% durable protection against tumor rechallenge in murine models of multiple myeloma, lymphoma, and ovarian cancer, established the MTD for single and multiple doses, identified biomarkers for use in the clinic, demonstrated equivalent function post- cryopreservation, developed protocols for expansion in serum-free media, designed and sequenced the human vector, expanded human cells in standard and gas permeable flasks, conducted a pre-IND meeting with FDA, written gt80% of the IRB, RAC, and IND documents, and engaged a world-class clinical team. This grant will take chNKG2D T cells into the clinic, and if successful will yield a therapy ready for Phase II clinical trials. Herein we propose to complete the remaining preclinical development and conduct a Phase I clinical trial. We will produce and qualify a master cell bank using pSFG-chNKG2D in PG13 packaging cells as well as gt9 liters of GMP/clinical grade vector, complete clinical trial preparations by: Generating an antibody to chNKG2D and a qPCR assay for PKPD studies, Developing protocols for clinical scale production of chNKG2D T cells and defining clinical SOPs, and Determining mechanisms associated with toxicity of chNKG2D T cells and their survival in vivo. In Year Two of this grant we will conduct a Phase I clinical trial, enrollig patients with both liquid and solid tumors and conductinga dose escalation to determine toxicity and MTD, and gain further insight into mechanism of action.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  In 2010 cancer surpassed CVD as the leading killer worldwide. By removing, purifying, modifying, growing, then infusing apatient&#039;s immune cells, we have been able to target and kill both liquid and solid cancers, and to simultaneously train the patient&#039;s own immune system to do likewise (e.g. to prevent metastatic disease). This project will culminate in a clinical trial ofthis promising therapy.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this Phase II project is to develop a new treatment for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) consisting of the inhaled platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) inhibitor PK10453. PAH is a diseaseof the pulmonary vasculature associated with high morbidity and mortality. Signaling through the PDGFR leads to smooth muscle cell proliferation which contributes to the development of PAH. The prior phase I study met the key quantitative milestone of demonstrating efficacy of inhaled PK10453 in two animal models of PAH. The Specific Aims of this phase II proposal consist of the following: 1) formulate PK10453 for a metered-dose inhaler (MDI) or as a dry powder for inhalation delivery; 2) Perform pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and maximum tolerated dose studies of the inhaled formulation. Aim one will define the physical and chemical characteristics of PK10453 in order to identify the most thermodynamically stable form of the compound. Based on this initial characterization, which will include a study of the salt forms of the compound, a formulation as a suspension or solution in an MDI may be developed. Alternatively PK10453 will be micronized then blended with a lactose carrier for a dry powder inhaler (DPI). Other strategies to develop a stable, reproducible inhaled formulation of PK10453 include spray drying techniques. Aim 2 will perform pharmacokinetic studies of inhaled compound, determine maximum tolerated dose in the rat and determine the formulation that decreases pulmonary hypertension without causing adverse effects on lung function or systemic blood pressure in the rat monocrotaline plus pneumonectomy model. At the conclusion of this project, the inhaled formulation of PK10453 will have been identified for pivotal IND enabling studies.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart failure (HF) remains one of the largest unsolved problems in health care today and continues to increase in incidence and cost ( 34.8 billion in US in 2008). Prognosis remains limited especially in patients with advanced heart failure. Transplantation is often the best option for patients with advanced HF whose hearts are not recoverable but is limited by many factors, primarily the small number of available donor hearts (lt 2500/yr in US). Use of current mechanical circulatory support (MCS) devices, though increasing, has also been limited due to the need for a major operation, restriction to Class IV patients, prolonged convalescence, and cost (over  100,000 US for the device itself). We have developed a novel MCSdevice (Symphony) that works synchronously with the heart, can be placed with a minor operation, and takes advantage of the proven benefits of counterpulsation. Symphony provides partial circulatory support to augment (not replace) native heart function.Recent clinical studies have provided strong evidence for the benefits of partial support. Also, experimental data strongly supports the benefits of partial support rather than complete unloading of the heart to promote myocardial recovery. The Symphony device is placed through an 8-cm infraclavicular incision similar to that used for placement of a permanent pacemaker. A short graft is sewn to the subclavian artery, connected to the pump, and then positioned superficial to the pectoralis muscle. Symphony is timed with the EKG to fill during systole and eject during diastole. Recent work in a Phase 1 study demonstrated subcutaneous EKG leads were as effective as epicardial leads for QRS detection and triggering. In this phase II study, we will complete development of the subcutaneous EKG lead system with integration to the Symphony device and lightweight, portable driver, and demonstrate efficacy, safety, and reliability of all system components. The development of a device that works synchronously with the heart, provides partial support (thereby promoting recovery), and can be placed with a   pacemaker pocket   operative approach may have a significant impact in expanding the role of circulatory support in the treatment of HF patients. The additional advantage of low cost (due to simplicity of design and a limited operative approach) may further expand the use of mechanical support with this device to currently large, unrealized, global markets.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Heart failure is a major and growing health care concern for which there are limited treatment options in advanced stages. A novel circulatory support device is being developed that works synchronously with the heart (thereby promoting recovery), can be placed without a major operation, and uses a proven mechanism of circulatory support (counterpulsation). This device may significantly increase the use of circulatory support for patients with advanced heart failure and possibly lead to earlier use in less ill patients with the  potential for myocardial recovery.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Approaches to drug screening typically involve dramatic compromises in order to achieve high throughput and hold down costs. Examples include the use of immortalized, heterologous cell lines, and genetic engineering toover-express the target protein and/or incorporate a fluorescent surrogate reporter to display the result. At least partly because such systems often produce responses that are not relevant to the actual human disease state, high throughput screening has not historically delivered a strong return on investment. More representative primary cell models are often available for tissues and diseases, but these models are underutilized in screening because of the lack of technological solutions and high costs. For similar reasons, more relevant assay technologies such as endogenous immunocytochemistry and electrophysiology are not commonly employed in HTS. The goal of this project is to bring the gold standard, organotypic cell model for airway epithelia into truehigh throughput screening, and enable the use of more informative high content assays including endogenous CFTR trafficking and airway surface liquid height. In addition to applications for cystic fibrosis and COPD, the resultant device will also be valuable for skin models and drug transport studies. The device consists of an array of 96 microchambers in standard microplate format. The microchamber design is small enough to be compatible with 384-well plate densities, so 384 microchambers per plate is readily achievable. The plate includes specialized features for compatibility and ease-of-use with standard liquid handling robotics, and high resolution microscopy. Importantly, the device is simple enough to be produced at a cost consistent with the cost constraints of HTS labs, and confers dramatic savings in primary cell and media consumption. The feasibility study on a small-scale device was successfully completed, indicating that the highly miniaturized approach is compatible with organotypic epithelialairway culture at air-liquid interface. Although not an aim of this proposal this device is designed to be integrated into an electrophysiology instrument designed specifically for this culture system.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project seeks todevelop an automatable device that uses the best possible cell models for airways disease, and the best possible tests or assays for the critical functions of human airways. The goal is to help improve the success ratios of bringing a candidate drug to the market for airways diseases like cystic fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder. The device will also be useful for finding drugs for other diseases like skin cancer and certain kidney diseases.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stem Cell-derived Human Cardiomyocytes (SC-hCMs) offer great potential for improving the accuracy of pre- clinical cardiac safety testing. We have characterized a population of SC-hCMs and have demonstrated that these cells show sensitive pharmacology that accurately predicts clinical responses. However, due to low assay throughput and limited resources, only 15 reference compounds were tested. We now propose to increase throughput in preclinical electrophysiology (EP) screens by utilizing a higher-throughput automated EP instrument. We will expand our preclinical in vitro testing to 77 compounds that have been carefully selected based on their known torsadogenic and/or QT prolonging effects. Results from SC-hCM-based assays will be referenced against complete (8 concentration, 8 replicate) concentration-curves of the same compounds generated from high-throughput screens of cell lines expressing each of the major cardiac ion channels. A statistics-based model will be created in collaboration with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and a leading in silico modeling firm, Leadscope. This model will be based on the unique databases we create which, together the development of software dedicated to mining public and proprietary cardiac databases will dramatically increase productivity of pre-clinical cardiac safet screening. The set of services and products that will result from this project have the potential t save millions of dollars annually by reducing attrition of marketed but cardiotoxic drugs, to improve the safety of drugs in development, and to increase efficiency of drug development by allowing companies to focus on the most promising and safe drug candidates.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Thrombotic cardiovascular diseases including venous thromboembolism (VTE), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), myocardial infarction, and ischemic stroke, remain leading causes of death and disability in the U.S. Although effective antithrombotic agents are available, these drugs inadvertently target vital hemostatic molecular mechanisms and can produce severe dose-limiting hemorrhagic toxicity, thereby limiting their use in some patients. Consequently, there is a significant and urgent unmet medical need for safer antithrombotic treatment alternatives. The proposed research will continue the development of an antithrombotic antibody against coagulation factor XI (AXIMAB 1A6) for the safe prevention and treatment of acute venousthrombosis. We have reached our Phase I milestones: 1) Establishing a minimum saturating dose of 1A6 (0.1mg/kg, iv) that is antithrombotic in baboons, 2) Showing that 1A6 has significant antithrombotic effects that are comparable to a high interventional dose of the low-molecular-weight heparin enoxaparin (Lovenox(R), 1mg/kg, iv), and 3) Verifying that the antithrombotic dose of AXIMAB 1A6 produces no measurable hemostatic impairment, in contrast to enoxaparin, which increases bleeding in the baboons. During Phase I we also discovered that 1A6 is more effective than our other prototype AXIMAB antibody 14E11 at limiting thrombus development under arterial shear flow conditions and during tissue factor initiated venous-type thrombosis. The difference in efficacy is likely related to distinct FXI molecular pathways that are targeted by the two antibodies. We therefore propose to continue the commercial development of AXIMAB 1A6 as our hemostatically safe and effective antithrombotic drug candidate. We have successfully advanced AXIMAB product development and are now prepared to further move AXIMAB towards clinical trials for the short-term prevention and treatment of acute DVT and VTE. The Specific Aims for this Phase II project that will be necessary to supportthe development of AXIMAB 1A6 through an investigational new drug (IND) application are to: 1) Evaluate the activity and efficacy of recombinant humanized AXIMAB 1A6, 2) Characterize manufactured GMP-grade humanized AXIMAB 1A6 formulations, and 3) Determine the dose-limiting toxicity of GMP-grade humanized AXIMAB 1A6 in preclinical studies. The AXIMAB approach represents a fundamentally new anticoagulation concept since the contribution of FXI to pathological coagulation appears to far outweigh its role innormal hemostasis. Thus, AXIMAB could represent an effective antithrombotic strategy that is exceptionally safe. Success of this Phase II  research and achievement of our critical milestones will lead directly into the next stage of product development that will consist of IND preparation and filing, followed by the initiation of phase 1 clinical studies to safely prevent and treat acute venous thrombosis and thromboembolism.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: While anticoagulant drugs (blood thinners) improve the outcome of blood clot related diseases (heart attack, stroke, and venous thrombosis), their usefulness is compromised by potentially severe bleeding-related side effects. Consequently, there remains an urgent unmet medical need for safer anticoagulant treatments. The proposed research addresses this need by continuing the development of a new antithrombotic antibody drug candidate AXIMAB (Anti-Factor XI Monoclonal Antibody), which has been shown in definitive primate studies to potently inhibit thrombotic blood vessel occlusion without increasing  bleeding, and thus provides a safe and effective alternative for treating and preventing thrombosis.",

The VAS consists of an Infant-sized Ventricular Assist Device (VAD) which can be used to support the left ventricle or right ventricle, or both ventricles (biventricular support), and a portable BiVAD driver which can power left and right VADs. Although VADs have been successfully used for adult heart-failure patients for over 30 years, their introduction to pediatrics has been slow to evolve. The pneumatically-actuated, pulsatile VAD is well-suited to the pediatric application, especially in infants. It may be utilized for right, left, or bi-ventricular support. Penn State and Minnetronix have developed a pulsatile pneumatic sac-type pediatric Ventricular Assist System based on the design of the adult-sized Pierce-Donachy (Thoratec(R)) VAD. The Infant VAD has a dynamic stroke volume of 14 ml, and is capable of supporting the circulation for periods up to one year. This work extends that development to a portable pneumatic driver and control system which will complete the development of the infant VASin preparation for pre-clinical testing. The driver will incorporate innovative features to automatically optimize the pump operation to achieve maximum flow rate under all preload conditions, and minimize thrombembolic risk, including during weaning. Special emphasis will be placed on usability in pediatric heart centers unfamiliar with VAD systems.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long term objective of this research is to commercialize a completely implantable LVAD system that is less expensive, more reliable and more biocompatible than existing percutaneous LVAD systems. Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) have significantly improved survival in patients bridged to transplant and in destination therapy for end stage heart failure. However, for LVADs to have a significant epidemiological impact on chronic heart failure, device improvements are needed to reduce infection, prevent non-surgical gastrointestinal bleeding, provide automatic speed control, and reduce cost. We propose to continue development of a unique Tesla rotary pump, and to integrate automatic speed control and complete implantability using wireless energy transmission. The specific aims are: 1. Refine the Phase I design for implantability, integration of pressure sensor, and further size reduction. The pump will be redesigned using thinner sections and a welded construction,with a pressure sensor in the inlet cannula body. Both of these modifications will reduce the pump size. 2. Test the final pump design with integrated pressure-based control through in vitro performance testing and in vivo studies. The redesigned pump will first use an external controller and hardwire for validation and verification of the system software and blood pump performance. After achieving satisfactory in vitro performance and dynamic response, the hardwired pump will be implanted in calves for acute studies. 3. Develop implantable electronics, implantable battery pack, TETS and external components. We will redesign and improve existing selected components such as the TETS primary and secondary coils, the patient external electronics, hermetic connectors, battery packs and enclosures. The same design knowledge applied to previous implanted systems will be applied. 4. Test the fully integrated, wireless system in vitro and in vivo. In vitro testing and limited pre-IDE testing willbe carried out on the integrated system. Complete systems will be evaluated in the bovine model with both acute and chronic studies. Acute studies will be performed to assess the system response to varying physiologic conditions. Chronic 30 day in vivo studies will be conducted to assess the biocompatibility of the system using careful examination of explanted components as well as necropsy and histology findings. 5. Develop design, manufacturing, and test documentation for pre-IDE submission. Throughout the project design documentation and design controls, as described in the FDA Quality System Regulation (QSR) will be utilized to provide a comprehensive design documentation file to the FDA. These techniques are a very effective tool in assuring a successful design and are a requirement of the FDA.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Tesla pump Left Ventricular Assist System is a completely implantable wireless system intended to be a more reliable, less expensive alternative to current LVAD technologies. Such a device has the potential to greatly expand the use of LVAD therapy in patients requiring long term mechanical circulatory support.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Congenital heart disease patients with functional single ventricle (FSV) anatomy usually require a series of surgeries during infancy and childhood in order to provide them with a chance to survive into adulthood. The second stage surgery, termed the hemi-Fontan procedure (HFP) re-routes systemic venous blood from the upper body and head into the pulmonary circulation without passing through an intervening ventricular chamber. Because blood flow into the lungs is largelya passive process, any anatomic obstruction within the pulmonary vasculature, elevated pulmonary vascular resistance, or significant ventricular dysfunction can result in patients having elevated hemi-Fontan pressures. Problems that develop within the hemi-Fontan pathway early in the staged palliation process can result in an increased risk for complications during the Fontan operation and throughout a Fontan patient&#039;s life. Therefore, maintaining optimal hemi-Fontan anatomy and physiology is important forlong term success and survival for FSV patients. Currently, it is not standard practice at most institutions to routinely measure hemi-Fontan pathway pressures in the immediate post- operative period or in the ambulatory setting while awaiting the Fontan.Post-operative monitoring of the hemi- Fontan pressures requires an indwelling catheter in an upper body or neck vein. This has the potential to lead to complete thrombosis of the systemic vein, which is a devastating complication for the hemi-Fontan patient. Furthermore, serial outpatient cardiac catheterizations to measure hemi-Fontan pressures place infants at risk for procedural complications. Therefore, to provide clinicians in the ICU and in the ambulatory setting with the means to measure hemi-Fontan pressures, investigators are developing a miniaturized pressure sensor that can be implanted directly into the hemi-Fontan pathway at the time of the second stage operation. The proposed implantable pressure monitor will provide readily available hemodynamic assessment of the hemi- Fontan pathway during the immediate post-operative period without the risk of systemic venous thrombosis. Interval testing of the hemi-Fontan pathway pressure in the ambulatory setting will allow clinicians to observe for rising pressure trends, which may provide early indication of a problem that is developing and allow for earlier intervention before irreversible damage has occurred. This will be accomplished without the risk associated with cardiac catheterization. During this study investigators will complete the development of a miniature implantable wireless pressure sensor. Final design freeze will be achieved, and design control requirements, including risk analysis, biocompatibility testing, sterility, and manufacturingprocesses, will be completed to satisfy FDA requirements. Preclinical animal studies will be carried out, including a chronic GLP animal study, to determine the device&#039;s in vivo biocompatibility, functionality, and safety profile. Finally, this study willsupport investigators during the application process to obtain Investigational Device Exemption from the FDA for the initial feasibility studies in infants with these complex forms of congenital heart disease.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective is to build and clinically assess PDRemote, a system for automated telehealth diagnostics for remote Parkinson&#039;s disease (PD) monitoring. Currently in the United States, there are approximately 1.5 millionpatients living wit PD and 50,000 new cases reported each year. However, there is limited access to movement disorder specialist centers for a significant portion of this population as well as limited opportunity for remote continuous monitoring of motorsymptoms to capture complex fluctuation patterns and optimize treatment protocols. PD is characterized by tremors of the fingers, hands, head, and neck, bradykinesia (slowed movements), and rigidity of musculature. Treatments include pharmaceutical interventions such as levodopa and surgical procedures such as deep brain stimulation (DBS). It is important to accurately quantify motor function and disability in PD  to assess intervention efficacy. Currently, subjective clinical rating scales, most commonly the Unified Parkinson&#039;s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), are used to show clinical improvement in PD. While the UPDRS has shown clinical utility, it requires presence of a clinician for scoring and only obtains a snapshot of symptoms during a clinical office visit. Furthermore, access to movement disorder specialists for effective motor symptom monitoring and management is critical for a geographically disparate subset of the PD population or those unable to travel. The location of movement disorder centers canlimit access to well-trained clinicians and effective symptom management for many PD patients. Telehealth technologies that can improve access for these patients can have a significant impact on the equity, accessibility, and management of the condition for remote patients or those unable to travel. PDRemote will provide remote, automated, motor symptom severity scoring to accurately quantify intervention effectiveness and limit the required number of office visits for treatment adjustments, thereby improving outcomes and decreasing costs for disparate patient populations. PD patients will be sent home with patient kit including an ergonomically designed touch-screen tablet PC, intuitive software interface for diaries, and a wireless motion sensor unit. Data collected from home sessions will be wirelessly transmitted to an online database that generates a motor symptom severity report for clinicians to review via a web-based interface and video conference with a patient to make appropriate medication changes. Feasibility was demonstrated in Phase I by patients successfully using the patient kit in the home to perform motor assessments and clinicians successfully using the web-based application to prescribe tests and view reports. Phase II will further improveergonomics, data transfer, reporting capabilities, and result in a clinically deployable technology. The system will be employed in a multi-center clinical trial to determine if  using the system can reduce fluctuations, decrease office visits, and improve patient outcomes.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Parkinson&#039;s disease is primarily characterized by motor symptoms of tremor, bradykinesia (slowed movements), and rigidity which can be very debilitating, leading to decreased mobility, independence, and quality of life. Clinicians lack quantitative tools for more continuous monitoring that capture how motor symptoms fluctuate during the day in response to treatment protocols to help minimize Parkinson&#039;s motor symptoms. PDRemote will be a repeatable, automated system clinicians will use to remotely monitor PD motor symptoms on a more continuous basis in a patient&#039;s home that should improve outcomes and decrease costs especially for disparate patient populations in areas not in close proximity to movementdisorder specialists.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT  Latinas have been disproportionately affected by HIV/AIDS since the beginning of the epidemic. Nearly 19% of women living with HIV/AIDS are Latina, even though Latinas constitute only 16% of US women, and HIV/AIDS is the fourth leading cause of death in Latinas aged 35-44. In 2006, Latinas represented one-quarter of new HIV infections in women, a rate of HIV infection four times higher than that of white women. While some behavioral prevention interventions tailored for Latinas have shown efficacyin reducing sexual risk, their successful replication has been hampered by cost, implementation challenges, and participation retention. At the same time, a new wave of computer-delivered interventions has emerged in the past few years, but none of theseprograms are tailored for adult Latinas or available in Spanish language versions. This project will address these gaps by continuing development of and conducting a randomized controlled efficacy trial on culturally tailored, English and Spanish language,computer-delivered versions of Project SAFE, an existing efficacious HIV prevention program for minority women. The resulting product will (1) make an efficacious HIV prevention intervention widely available to service agencies at low cost; (2) facilitatefaithful program implementation (i.e., by means of a computer) with minimal staff involvement; (3) promote target population participation by permitting sensitive topics to be addressed privately (i.e., one-on-one with the computer) and according to a flexible schedule; and, (4) reduce sexual risk-taking behavior and HIV infection rates among Latinas, who are disproportionately affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic.",

The populations of interest in this study are Koreans, Vietnamese, Filipinos, African Americans and Latinos. The specific aims of this study are to: (1) identify HPV vaccine literacy levels, attitudes, perceptions and information sources among diverse at-risk populations, (2) identify specific themes, message elements and communication strategies for an intervention that enhances patient comprehension and evaluation of therisks and benefits of the vaccine, (3) identify cultural values, beliefs, and practices that influence attention, comprehension, and appraisal of HPV vaccine information intended to inform an immunization decision, (4) design and produce a multicultural,multilingual education intervention that delivers cognitively accessible, culturally competent, health literacy information about HPV vaccination tailored to diverse populations at high risk for HPV infection, and (5) evaluate the efficacy of an interactive multicultural, multilingual learning and decision tol using next-generation digital videodisc technology to increase patients&#039; knowledge about the HPV vaccine, assess the risks and benefits attendant to HPV vaccination, and promote informed vaccination decisions among the diverse racial/ethnic groups in this study. This study responds to the HHS Initiative to Eliminate Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities, which cals atention to the gaps in access to preventive health resources, principally among racial and ethnic minorities. This study will conduct focus groups and cognitive interviews to guide development of culturally competent, age-appropriate materials tailored to 16 diverse audiences in four different languages (English, Spanish, Korean and Vietnamese) on a single Blu-ray disc. It will conduct cross-cultural validation of decision-making scales for use with our five study populations. It will also conduct a randomized, controlled efficacy evaluation of the health literacy intervention among the five study populations. The study enlists the collaboration of established, well-regarded community-based organizations from each of the racial/ethnic communities to guide the study and provide access to prospective study participants in their respective communities. It also leverages our extensive experience with complex, multicultural, multilingual studies to effectively manage the challenges of this multi-audience health literacy study.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Fast-Track SBIR proposal submitted by SoloHealth of Duluth, Georgia, requests grant funds to build and test a multifunction health-screening kiosk. Our current kiosk prototype, EyeSite, has demonstrated efficacy inreaching low income, high health disparity populations with over 109,000 uses in less than 9 months of testing. Our goal is to expand the offerings of a single function visual acuity screening, to a multifunctional health screening kiosk, focusing on riskfactors that disproportionately impact African Americans and Hispanics including high   blood pressure, obesity, stress, and diet and exercise behaviors, all important risk factors for heart disease, stroke, diabetes and cancer. Importantly, the businessmodel of the proposed multifunction Health and Wellness Kiosk (HWK) supports free screening where the kiosk is placed in high traffic retail locations thus providing easy access to high disparity populations including rural communities. The goal of SoloHealth is to apply our innovative use of technology and health marketing experience within the target community to decrease health disparities. This is accomplished by offering, in addition to the health screening, educational information and specific referrals to local healthcare providers for follow up. A unique approach to the health screening kiosk concept, SoloHealth&#039;s HWK will provide users with a customized User Report, and relevant health information that will motivate them to seek further healthcare and more advanced intervention as necessary. In Phase I, we will design the necessary software and hardware specifications for a multifunction, interactive screening kiosk. At the end of Phase I we will test a laboratory version of the kiosk. In Phase II, we will design and test a prototype. Based on the findings, 6 beta units will be built and tested in a consumer-based trial of efficacy, in high traffic retail.      (PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT): Preventive health care is the first line of defense against the overwhelming burden of chronic disease facing the American population. A free health and wellness kiosk that provides health screening for visual acuity, blood pressure, weight, stress and diet and exercise behaviors will offer advantages to populations who lack access to traditional physician based or clinic based health screening and will prompt follow up care with healthcare professionals.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this Fast Track Small Business Innovation Research application, submitted by KDH Research and Communication (KDHRC), is to develop and evaluate an online information clearinghouse to support community-based nonprofit organizations&#039; (NPOs) use of promotores programs to provide health information to underserved Latinos. Promotores programs use community health workers (CHWs) to conduct outreach for health promotion, prevention, and medical treatment, and there is increasing evidence that they improve health outcomes. The proposed Toda Promotora Clearinghouse (TPC) will provide information on the formulation, implementation, and evaluation of promotores programs to Latino-serving NPOs. Through the provisionof centralized, scientifically-based information, TPC will support NPOs in the effective use of promotores programs to increase positive health outcomes among the clients that they serve.  The need for TPC is significant. Latino populations experience health disparities, or detrimental differences in the presence of disease, health outcomes, and access to care. NPOs are often at the forefront of addressing health disparities because they are key providers of health services, particularly for Latinos that may seek community-based health care because of lack of insurance, language barriers, or distrust of the mainstream medical system. But the recent economic downturn and governmental funding cuts have strained the fiscal capacity of many NPOs, necessitating the development and implementation of low-cost, yet effective, service delivery approaches. One promising approach is the use of promotores programs, but there is a lack of systematic information available to NPOs about their optimal formulation, implementation, and evaluation. Therefore, TPC aims to improve Latino health outcomes by increasing the health delivery capacity of Latino-serving NPOs through a clearinghouse of evidence-based information on establishing effective or improving existing promotores programs.  In Phase I of TPC we will conduct extensive formative research with a panel of experts in the field and NPO directors. We will then develop a TPC prototype and conduct a feasibility evaluation using a pretest/post test control group design. The evaluation will to examine the extent to which the TPC prototype changes knowledge, attitudes, and self-efficacy about promotores programming in a group of NPO directors.  In Phase II, we will finalize TPC by developing additional content and features for the website. We will then conduct an outcome evaluation that will include two studies. The first study will use similar methodology to the feasibility evaluation. The second evaluation will be a process study of how and to what extent NPOs and their directors use TPC and how its use impacts promotores programmatic outcomes. Together, the two evaluations will provide information for the commercialization of TPC and a wealth of data for publishing.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The SCID is the &#039;gold standard&#039; for all research-based mental health diagnoses in the United States and for CNS clinical trials worldwide. But, it has been expensive and cumbersome to administer. In Phase I and II of this project we successfully developed the NetSCID, a highly flexible software package for administering the SCID. In this Phase II competing renewal project, we propose to enhance the NetSCID diagnostic software package to make it compliant with DSM-5. In addition, we intend to create 4 standardized &#039;official translations&#039; of the NetSCID into Chinese, Russian, Latin American Spanish, and French. Together these languages represent between 30 and 50% of the world&#039;s population, when one includes native and secondary languages spoken. Our Phase II study indicated that the NetSCID is preferred my 75% of clinician relative to the paper SCID and it has been shown to reduce branching and data entry errors. In addition the program contains a database with the patient&#039;s response to every item. This same database will also be shared between all languages. Because of the existence of a single searchable database, the NetSCID will give researchers the ability to identify &#039;clusters of symptoms&#039; rather than just the DSM diagnoses associated with a study result. The president of the APA has suggested that the validity of the DSM must be based on research on &#039;clusters of symptoms&#039; as they appear in research studies rather than on fixed categories of symptoms as they have traditionally existed in DSM. The NIH has also established in the RDoC strategic plan initiative that DSM diagnoses do not map well to human genes. Because of its unique ability to be used to identify &#039;clusters of symptoms&#039; in addition to diagnoses, the NetSCIDmay facilitate the development of future versions of the DSM and it may also facilitate the identification of genes that may be more closely associated with specific symptom clusters than DSM diagnoses. The NetSCID will also enable researchers to identifyclusters of symptoms in CNS trials that may respond better to an intervention than would be suggested by comparison with traditional diagnostic categories. This could also facilitate the development of &#039;personalized medicine&#039;. Because the NetSCID for DSM-5would immediately allow for these new types of research and because the four additional &#039;official translations&#039; will promote global clinical trials and cross-cultural research with 30 to 50% of the  world&#039;s population, we believe that this project could have a lasting global impact.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This Phase II Competing Renewal project proposes the development of five timely NetSCID products, all based on the DSM-5 (NetSCID-5): (1) an English NetSCID-5, (2) a Chinese NetSCID-5, (3) a French NetSCID- 5, (4) a Russian NetSCID-5, and (5) a Latin American Spanish NetSCID-5. In the process of creating these products, we will also produce more culturally sensitive and standardized translations of the SCID-5 in Chinese, French, Russian, and Spanish. Together, these NetSCID products will represent five of the six official languages of the World Health Organization (WHO, 2011) as well as the five most widely spoken languages in the world, counting bilingual individuals (Ethnologue, 2011). Access to NetSCID-5 in each of the 5 languages will ensure that clinicians and researchers across the globe have flexible access to a rigorous standardized diagnostic assessment that will be up-to-date with the latest mental health diagnostic definitions, specifically those released wit DSM-5, for the purposes of improving clinical practice as well as cross-cultural research and our understanding of the true burden of mental illness on a global scale.",

The final DVD and workbook, to be used by both parents and adolescents, is based on a face-to-face intervention that has demonstrated efficacy in a NIMH randomized trial (R01MH 63008, Project STYLE). The goal of this Phase II project is to finalize the DVD prototype of the Communication Skills Module, which was developed in Phase I, develop the Information and Parental Monitoring/Risk Reduction Modules, and evaluate the final interactive DVD and workbook, targeting parent- adolescent communication and sexual and substance use risk behavior among high-risk, urban African-American adolescents. MEE (Motivational Educational Entertainment) Productions Inc., a social marketing firm with expertise in urban and ethnic audiences, will continue to partner with Rhode Island Hospital to develop and test this innovative, culturally relevant DVD and workbook. The DVD package will include risk-reduction and parenting messages on two DVDs; one for adolescents ages 13 - 18 and one for the adults in their lives. To inform the design of the DVD package, MEE and RIH will moderate a series of focus groups with African American parents and adolescentsages 13 - 18, along with community-based organizations and service providers in Philadelphia. The final DVD and workbook will focus on: HIV/STD information, adolescent sexual and substance use risk behaviors, assertive communication with parents and partners, and parental monitoring. The DVD and workbook will then be evaluated, through a small-randomized clinical trial, in the final months of the Phase II project. One hundred and seventy African-American parent-adolescent dyads in Providence and Philadelphia will be enrolled and randomized to either the HIV prevention DVD and workbook developed in this project or an attention matched health promotion control DVD and workbook condition, to examine the impact of the HIV prevention intervention, relative to the control condition, on improving adolescent HIV risk attitudes and intentions and parent-adolescent communication/monitoring.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The number of young people contracting HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections continues to grow, with minority populations disproportionately affected. Equipping families to help adolescents make safer sexual decisions can potentially reduce the growing number of annual infections among urban minority communities.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia is a chronic and debilitating disorder that impacts nearly 1% of the world&#039;s population. The burden on the families and caregivers of patients is immense, with the cost of care in the United States being greater than  60 billion annually. The exorbitant financial strain of schizophrenia arises, in large part, to a lack of innovation that has resulted in very limited, ineffective and poorly-tolerated treatment options. Virtually all of the antipsychotics approved by the FDA in the past fifty years act exclusively on dopamine and/or serotonin receptor function; however, unfortunately, these antipsychotics are routinely associated with poor patient compliance due to inadequate efficacy and the emergence of serious side effects including motor impairments and metabolic / cardiovascular side effects. The overall goal of this Phase II SBIR is to continue the development of our novel and innovative antipsychotic medications that are proposed to be an effective and safer alternative to the current standards of care. Specifically, cystine-glutamate exchange (system xc-) appears to be altered in schizophrenic patients, and we have shown previously in our Phase I SBIR that targeting this mechanism is highly effective ina rodent model of schizophrenia. This current grant application is designed to capitalize on these findings and our Phase I SBIR funds that were employed to discover and investigate a novel series of molecules engineered to target system xc-. Our lead small molecules are potent drivers of system xc- in cortical cultures in vitro and we have confirmed preclinical proof-of-efficacy in rodent models of schizophrenia. We propose to expand on these findings and further characterize our lead molecule in IND-directed safety pharmacology and toxicology studies, with an eye towards developing a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of schizophrenia and potentially other psychiatric disorders.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Schizophrenia is a chronic, debilitating disorder that results in a devastating burden on the families and caregivers of patients. The cost of care in the United States is in excess of  60 billion a year.

The goal of this Phase II SBIR project is to fully characterize lead drug development candidates identified in workfunded by the Phase I grant with an eye towards the development of novel and innovative antipsychotic agents.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia is a devastating and costly mental illness with direct and unemployment costs approaching  95 billion per year. Cognitive impairments affect the majority of patients with schizophrenia. These impairments are strongly associated with poor long-term psychosocial outcomes and reflect a large and significant unmet clinical need. FDA approval of new drugs for cognitive impairment in patients with schizophrenia requires pharmaceutical companies to demonstrate notonly improvements on cognitive tests, but also clear evidence that these cognitive changes lead to clinically meaningful improvements in functional capacity. Measures of functional capacity, known as co-primary measures, indicate the degree to which individuals have changed their potential to alter real-world behavior. At present, there are no standard measures of functional capacity, and existing data do not support the recommendation of any single instrument. The Virtual Reality Functional Capacity Assessment Tool (VRFCAT Copyright (c) 2011) is a novel computer based virtual-reality measure of functional capacity that relies on a realistic simulated environment to recreate routine activities of daily living. We designed it initially for use in domestic schizophrenia drug  trials and were successful at developing and pilot testing it in the NIMH SBIR Phase 1 project. Findings on VRFCAT&#039;s reliability were encouraging and indicated that it may be superior to the most commonly used measure of functional capacity, the UPSA-2. In this Phase 2 SBIR application, we propose to further evaluate and establish the VRFCAT&#039;s sensitivity, reliability, validity and practicality, and prepare to commercialize it through NeuroCog Trials&#039; existing sales and operational infrastructure. This application has 5 specific aims: 1) Examine VRFCAT&#039;s ability to measure changes in functional capacity by comparing it to the UPSA-2 in patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls; 2) Examine and compare the test-retest reliabilities ofthe VRFCAT and UPSA-2; 3) Determine the association between performance on the VRFCAT and performance on the standard measure of cognition, the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB); 4) Examine the relative strength of the relationship of the VRFCAT and the UPSA-2 with a measure of real-world functioning outcomes, the Specific Levels of Functioning (SLOF); 5) Assess the usability and practicality of the VRFCAT for both patients and research staff in multiple clinical trial settings. In Phase 1 we showed the VRFCAT to be a reliable measure. Phase 2 will allow us to further develop and commercialize the VRFCAT. This new and superior measure of functional capacity could improve clinical trials and facilitate approval for drugs to treat cognitive impairmentin patients suffering from schizophrenia. The VRFCAT has the potential to fulfill the FDA&#039;s requirement of a reliable co- primary measure, and will help determine which new drugs have a meaningful impact on cognition and on the lives of schizophrenia patients.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness that affects approximately three million Americans and costs about  100 billion a year for direct treatment, community services, and lost wages. While the most obvious symptoms such as hallucinations and bizarre beliefs can be minimized with treatment, there is no currently available treatment for the underlying cognitive disturbances such as memory and attention impairment that are the prime cause of functional disability. Because one of the greatest current challenges of drug development in schizophrenia is to find the best tools for measuring changes in cognition and functioning, this research aims to provide the field with a valid measure of changes in functionally relevantcognition.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project aims at developing the Orion microscope system, a highly innovative combined software/hardware product, which will facilitate automated investigations of dynamics of migration of neuronal precursors and neurite outgrowth in vitro using time-lapse video-microscopy (TLVM). To achieve this goal, the Orion microscope system will combine novel software with two innovative microscope hardware devices that were recently developed and patented by MBF: (i) movable Extended Microscope Objective devices, and (ii) a dual- objective microscope setup. The Orion microscope system will allow investigators, for the first time, to inspect a tissue culture with two microscope objectives simultaneously (using fluorescence illumination), with the possibility of moving the objectives in XYZ directions independent of each other. This system will help uncover new discoveries about neuronal precursors and neurite outgrowth. The development of the mammalian brain is dependent on extensive migration of neuronal precursors. There is need for a better understanding of the regulation of (and correction of disturbed) migration of neuronal precursors in the developing brain, in order to develop novel approaches for preventing and treating various neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders such as childhood-onset epilepsy, autism, schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, lissencephaly, and the neurologic and neurobehavioral sequelae seen in children with HIV-1 infection. Furthermore, better insights into the dynamics of neurite outgrowth (and particularly the correction of impaired neurite outgrowth) have become an important aspect in the development of novel therapeutic strategies to combat neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer&#039;s disease, Parkinson&#039;s disease, Huntington&#039;s disease, and NeuroAIDS. To study the dynamics of neuronal precursor migration and neurite outgrowth, investigators usually perform TLVM on dissociated neuron cultures or organotypic slice cultures of the brain in vitro, inspecting single fields-of-view. Several software and combined software/hardware products exist to assist investigators in such studies. However, none of these products comprise the following functionality that is considered critical inadvanced, automated analyses of the dynamics of migration of neuronal precursors and neurite outgrowth: (i) identifying and follow up migrating neuronal precursors and growing neurites across many microscopic fields-of-view within large tissue cultures atlow magnification and, simultaneously, (ii) determining the different modes of migration of the identified migrating neuronal precursors or subtle changes in growing neurites at high magnification. This will open new horizons in understanding the dynamic behaviors of neurons during development, re-organization, and degeneration of the brain, with high relevance for both neuroscience research and the development of novel therapeutic strategies to prevent or combat the aforementioned disorders. Accordingly, the development of the Orion microscope system represents clear progress beyond the state-of-the-art, with great benefits for the neuroscience research community and society in general.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed Orion microscope systemwill open new horizons in basic neuroscience research as well as in pharmacological and biotechnological research and development, by providing a powerful, automated dual objective microscope system to investigate dynamics of migration of neuronal precursors and outgrowth of neuronal processes in a petri dish. The overall effect of this project will benefit research in novel therapeutic strategies for preventing and treating various neurological, neuropsychiatric, and neurodegenerative disorders such as childhood-onset epilepsy, autism, schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, lissencephaly, and the neurologic and neurobehavioral sequelae seen in children with HIV-1 infection, as well as Alzheimer&#039;s disease, Parkinson&#039;s disease, Huntington&#039;sdisease, and NeuroAIDS.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The internet is an increasingly important resource for clinicians to access training materials and resources for treatment delivery of evidence-based treatments such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and antidepressant medications. This project proposes to develop a secure, web-based resource to provide therapists with instructional materials for scheduling tailored, interactive text messages for delivery to depressed adolescents in treatment. The content of the selectable, short message service (SMS) interactions will be designed to engage the adolescents, encourage compliance, and support clinical objectives of various treatment modules available through the password-protected website. The therapists will be able toreview clients&#039; responses to the automated SMS queries, permitting treatment plan adjustments to be based on measured progress between visits.  Eight therapists (4 from the University of Texas Southwestern and 4 from University of Nebraska Medical School)will be asked to complete the training materials developed for the website. They will incorporate the SMS-augmented treatment modules into a 12-week treatment protocol for four depressed adolescents (12-17 years old). The treatment protocol will include weekly therapeutic sessions (total N = 32, 16 from each site). Clinician-based ratings (QIDS-A, CGI-S, CGI-C) and patient-reported outcomes (internet K-SADs depression module, QIDS-A-Pat) will be obtained at baseline, and at weeks 6, 12, and 24. The Centerfor Psychological Consultation will recruit a cohort of community-based therapists who treat depressed adolescents to identify a community-control sample of 32 adolescents receiving treatment-as-usual (TAU). The community-control TAU patients will also beassessed at baseline and weeks 6, 12, and 24 with the same outcome measures.  Primary comparisons will be clinical outcome differences between the SMS- augmented treated patients and those receiving TAU at weeks 6, 12, and 24. Secondary clinical analyses will examine whether more rapid onset of symptomatic improvement at week 6, particularly in the SMS-augmented group, is predictive of sustained remission from depression at week 24.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Major depression is a disabling conditionthat often begins in adolescence, disrupting development, impairing functioning, and increasing risk for substance abuse, suicide, and adulthood depression. Technologies to facilitate new modes of communication, such as text-messaging, are often adopted earliest by younger members of our modern society. The internet has also become an increasingly important resource to both clinicians and patients. Innovative methods are needed to take advantage of multi- media training opportunities to assist clinicians to incorporate automated interactive text- messaging assessments into therapeutic homework assignments, monitor medication side effects, assess symptom severities, and provide encouragement.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is to complete and validate a new web-based tool to assist in the screening, diagnosis and management of mental health disorders (focusing here on ADHD), quality improvement (QI) documentation and efficient large scale research. CHADIS is a screening, assessment and decision support system delivering tools online for care of health, development, and mental health conditions including ADHD. CHADIS provides online questionnaires for parents, teens and teachers to complete prior to a visit. These are automatically scored to yield conclusions on a worksheet linked to electronic chapters of clinician guidance and myriad resources for families which become handouts. Clinical data is shared securely among professionals, also forming a deidentified research database.  This proposal is to adapt CHADIS tools to optimize use for ADHD care, QI and research. Proper care of ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder), a common treatable mental health condition, calls for accurate diagnosis, assessment for comorbidity and multiple observer input. Among CHADIS&#039; tools is a comprehensive previsit parent questionnaire (CHADIS-DSM) for assessing child mental health problems based on the logic of both DSM-IV and DSM-PC and producing provisional DSM diagnoses. While pilot data on CHADIS DSM is encouraging, additional validation focusing on ADHD and its comorbidities is needed. This project also proposes creating   case-specific templates   (CST) within CHADIS to receive the responses from all previsit parent, teen or teacher questionnaires to provide specific guidance to clinicians. CSTs will provide the clinician with evidence-based prompts, e.g. symptoms to explore, suggested wording for questions, menus of observations from which to select, and related text to help further confirm, refute or change the presumptive conclusions from parent/teen data. CST use will document evidence of diagnostic criteria, diagnose more accurately, improve care, and compile a research database. This study will validate CHADIS-DSM for ADHD and its comorbidities and assess the impact of CSTs on accuracy of diagnoses. 1100 4-12 year olds presenting for care in 2 existing CHADIS practice networks will be screened. Those 300 seeking care for behavior problems, and all positive among 800 coming for well visits plus a random sample of those negative will complete comparison and gold standard criterion measures. Pediatricians are required to conduct a QI effort in use of evidence based practices in order tomaintain professional certification through the American Board of Pediatrics (ABP). ABP approved QI programs require chart audits for documentation of approved care, difficult for practices to implement. Another product of this proposal is making CHADIS the first system for pediatric care that collects both patient data and clinician responses thus providing automated documentation of care for QI accreditation.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), a disorder affecting 4-12% of children, is mainly diagnosed and managed by primary care physicians yet evidence based guidelines and optimized outcomes are generally not achieved. The American Board of Pediatrics is striving to improve all pediatric care by requiring Quality Improvement (QI) activities but the recertification process is onerous. This proposal is to complete and validate additions to CHADIS, an innovative web-based system for healthcare that delivers previsit questionnaires online and presents results to theclinician linked to decision support and helpful resource listings, in order to overcome obstacles to implementation of QI, in this case for ADHD, by guiding and documenting clinicians&#039; responses to parent input, to increase evidence-based care and to create a tool facilitating large scale research projects.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the past several decades, a large number of mental health (MH) practices and interventions have been rigorously tested through randomized control trials and shown efficacious. However, despite availability, evidence-based interventions (EBIs) are rarely adopted in everyday practice within community MH service settings. Further, even when adopted, MH EBIs are seldom implemented with strong adherence to the original design and often fail to be sustained over time. A growing body of literature demonstrates how implementation quality is directly related to the likelihood an EBI will be embedded into everyday clinical practice as well as the likelihood that EBI achieves its intended treatment outcomes. As outlined in NIMH&#039;s Strategic Plan, innovative methods to help close the gap between development of research-tested interventions and their widespread use are critically needed. This Phase II SBIR project will continue research and development of the Web- Based Dissemination Tool for Community Mental Health (WDT-C), a flexible technology infrastructure specifically designed to foster quality implementation of MH EBIs within community MH service settings on a broad scale. WDT-C will offer a suite of customizable online toolsand services, including cost-efficient high quality training and supervision resources, ongoing implementation assistance for providers, adherence monitoring, and outcomes tracking. Prototype development and feasibility testing with key stakeholders weresuccessfully completed in Phase I, providing substantial support for the product as well as specific recommendations for Phase II development. Three specific aims will be accomplished through this Phase II project. The first aim is to develop the full technology infrastructure utilizing Phase I feedback, and apply it to a third, independent MH EBI. To ensure maximal quality and make any needed adjustments prior to product testing, usability of this new WDT-C application will be assessed by community MH administrators and providers. The second aim is to conduct a scientific evaluation of WDT-C. Each of the three WDT-C supported EBIs will be implemented by community MH providers randomly assigned to either Implementation-As-Usual (no WDT-C support) or EnhancedImplementation (WDT-C supported implementation) conditions. Differences between conditions will be tested in five implementation outcome areas: (a) organizational readiness for intervention implementation, (b) adherence to intervention protocol, (c) satisfaction with intervention and implementation support, (d) sustainability of intervention, and (e) treatment benefits. The final aim is to finalize all product components based on Phase II findings and evaluations in preparation for Phase III commercialization. This SBIR project will yield a flexible, scalable technology infrastructure that can be applied to any community MH EBI to effectively decrease costs (time, financial, personnel) to both providers and intervention developers, enhance the quality withwhich EBIs are implemented in community settings, and increase dissemination of EBIs into   real world   everyday practice.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Each year in the U.S., about 6 percent of youth and 13 percent of adults receive some form of mental health (MH) care, at an annual cost of more than  112 billion [1, 2]. In addition, each year NIMH and other foundations fund more than  785 million for MH research, much of it devoted to treatment studies [3]. Unfortunately, it currently takes an average of 17 years for clinical research findings, such as those generated by randomized control trials, to be used regularly in clinical practice [4]. As a result, the current state of MH care in the United States lags far behind the current state of its research knowledge base. As the mental health research-practice gap has become increasingly evident, numerous federal reports have called for action to better connect research findings to clinical practice (e.., The President&#039;s New Freedom Commission Report [5]; Reports of the Surgeon General on Mental Health [6], Youth Violence [7], and Culture, Race, and Ethnicity [8]; Institute of Medicine [9] and the National Children&#039;s Call to Action [10]). Building on the recommendations of clinical and research communitymembers during the   Enhancing the Discipline of Clinical and Translational Sciences   meeting (May, 2005), the National Institutes of Health (NIH) identified research efforts to bridge science and practice as the primary objective of NIH&#039;s roadmap. The proposed research directly addresses this NIH Roadmap priority as well as these federal calls for action. The findings from the proposed research will advance our understanding of how to successfully integrate MH evidence-based interventions (EBIs) into everyday practice within community MH service settings. Increasing the likelihood that EBIs will be adopted, used as intended, and sustained in everyday practice, in turn, will increase the likelihood that society at  large will benefit from evidence-based practices.",

Innovative approaches are needed to support the well-being of veterans who may not access or be reached by formal services. Objectives. This Phase II project will complete development and evaluation of a self-directed, home- based intervention to be used by OIF/OEF veteransand their loved ones to aid in the readjustment process.   Mission Reconnect   is an integrated program of (1) guided mind/body stress reduction and relaxation practices, (2) contemplative practices to engender and support appreciation, empathy and forgiveness for oneself and one&#039;s loved ones, and (3) video instruction in use of simple massage techniques with a partner for connection and stress reduction. Feasibility was established in Phase I with high user satisfaction and significant impact on measures of stress, depression, PTSD, and self-compassion, as well as qualitative data. In Phase II We will complete and evaluate the full program in a four-arm randomized controlled trial. Specific Aims: 1. Revise program content based on Phase I quantitative and qualitative data. 2. Film a diverse group of ten 10 veteran/partner dyads receiving and using revised material; use video footage for the final program. 3. Produce high quality audio and video components of the revised program. 4. Produce a multi-modal system for delivery of instructional components that leverages innovations in web-based and mobile device technologies to maximize access, utilization, and data collection. 5.

Today, there are an estimated 1.5 million life science MATLAB users, with a substantial portion of those using MATLAB to solve neuroscience-related problems. MATLAB users, especially those dealing with large neuroscience datasets, such as brain MRI, fMRI, DW-MRI, PET, and CT image volumes, microscopy imagery, and genomics datasets, currently havetwo major problems in using MATLAB to conduct neuroscience research: 1) MATLAB is slow when compared to other programming languages such as C/C++, and 2) MATLAB visualizations are unable to handle large amounts of data or to render 3D models of anatomicalstructures with ease. Therefore, neuroscientists often undertake costly and time-consuming efforts to port neuroscience MATLAB code to C/C++, at the expense of slowing down research efforts, collaborations, and ultimately detracting from the researcher&#039;s primary focus of solving biological problems.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A human brain is estimated to have roughly 100 billion neurons connected through more than 100  thousand miles of axons and a quadrillion of synaptic connections (~10 15 or 2 50 connections). As a comparison, there aremore synaptic connections in human brains in the city of Boston alone than grains of sand in all the desserts and beaches in the world (~10 20). The neural circuit within each brain is called its connectome, and understanding how it works and enables cognition, consciousness, or intelligence is one of the most fundamental questions in science.   Given  this  complexity  it  is  not  surprising  that the  neural  circuits  underlying  even  the  simplest  of  behaviors are not understood. Until recently, attempts to fully describe such circuits were never even seriously entertained, as it was  considered too numerically complex.  However, modern advances in the  preparation,  sectioning,  and  imaging  of  brain  tissue  in  the  last  five  years  have  enabled  biologists to  image  neural  connectivity  at  scales  of  only  a  few  nanometers  in  a  highly  automated  manner.  Neuroscience  researchers  are  using  confocal  and  electron  microscopy  techniques  to  image  serial  sections at high resolution. Current three-dimensional image datasets are up to several terabytes in size.  With  automation  and  faster  imaging,  we  expect   dataset  sizes  to  increase  by  orders of  magnitude.   Unfortunately,  processing  and  analyzing  these  imagesin  order  to  identify  the  connectome  of  any  mammalian brain is still an incredibly difficult task, and only a few groups across the world have started  to address  this problem.    We propose to develop the computational infrastructure necessary formapping the wiring of neurons in a large volume of neural tissue that has been cut into ultrathin serial sections.  We will develop an open- source system that supports analysis of arbitrarily large image volumes. By being able to trace every neural process in a volume within a reasonable amount of time (days or weeks instead of years), our system will enable a collaborative effort to develop efficient automatic methods for segmentation and tracing.  The proposed system will support remote data access so that the enormous datasets can be accessed simultaneously by geographically diverse research groups.  Custom clients will be developed to implement various segmentation algorithms, with results uploaded to a central database.  In this way the segmentation results obtained with one algorithm can be compared against those obtained with another algorithm on the same datasets. We will also implement fusion methods that will take as input the segmentation results from different algorithms and that will generate the tracings of neural processes by linking segmentation results from one section to the next.             PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Connectome scientists are using ultra-thin serial sections and nanometer resolution electron microscopes to reverse engineerneural circuits of the brain.  In the not too distant future we will be  able to compare neural activity with their circuit diagrams o understand how higher level cognitive  tasks such as learning, memory, association and inductive reasoning are implemented in the mammalian  brain.  We propose to create a scalable open-source software system that will help biologists trace neurons through massive 50-terabyte connectome datasets.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is to develop methods to obtain high-resolution crystal structures of Family C G- protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). These structures would greatly facilitate the development of effective and highly selective allosteric drug molecules for the treatment of psychiatric and neurological disorders. GPCRs are characterized by the presence of seven membrane-spanning alpha-helical segments separated by alternating intracellular and extracellular loop regions. GPCRs in vertebrates are commonly divided into five families by sequence and structural similarity, specified as Rhodopsin (Family A), Secretin (Family B), Glutamate (Family C), Adhesion, and Frizzled/Taste2. Family C GPCRs are structurally distinct from Family A receptors. While they share the same 7 TM topology, there is no sequence homology with Family A receptors. Family C receptors have a large extracellular, amino terminal ligand binding site consisting of a bilobed venus flytrap domain. However, it has been possible to modulate the activity of several Family C receptors by small molecule drugs that bind directly to the 7TM bundle and regulate receptor activity allosterically. The 7TM bundle is an ideal drug target because there is less sequence conservation between closely related receptor subtypes than observed for the native hormone binding site located in the Venus flytrap domain. Despite very active academic and industrial research efforts on drug discovery for GPCRs over the past two decades, the number of new GPCR drugs has been disappointing. One of the major bottlenecks in drug development has been the lack of high-resolution structural information on GPCRs for both identifying and optimizing leads. A recent advance in crystallization technology for family A GPCRs was developed in the laboratory of ConfometRx co-founder Brian Kobilka: generating GPCR-T4 Lysozyme (GPCR-T4L) fusion proteins. This technology has been applied to the high-resolution structures of six Family A GPCRs, opening new opportunities for structure-based design of drugs. We propose to adapt this technology to Family C receptors, using the metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) as a model system. The mGluRs are expressed primarily in the central nervous system and arepotential therapeutic targets for the treatment of several neuropsychiatric disorders. In Phase I of this SBIR, we demonstrated the feasibility of using the GPCR-T4L technology to express and purify functional mGluR-T4L fusion proteins. In Phase II, we will proceed with the crystallization trials and structure determination and will use this information to initiate the development of a new class of mGluRs drugs. The methodology developed for generating mGluR-T4L proteins should be readily applicable to other Family C GPCRs. This proposal is in response to the NIH PA-10-081, Novel Tools for Investigating Brain-derived GPCRs in Mental Health Research, as well as Roadmap initiatives on the Structural Biology of Membrane Proteins.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to develop methods to determine the three-dimensional structures of Family C G-protein- coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are known to play essential roles in regulating normal neuronal function in the central nervous system. Their diverse physiologic roles make them viable therapeutic targets for the treatment of several psychiatric and neurological disorders including anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, depression, Parkinson&#039;s disease, and Alzheimer&#039;s disease among others. High-resolution crystal structures of Family C GPCRs will provide valuable tools for the development of more effective and selective drugs.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This SBIR project is developing a system capable of remotely monitoring, in real-time, the adherence of an HIV patient to Antiretroviral therapy (ART). ART is a medication regimen that once started, needs to be followedfor the rest of the patient&#039;s life. ART has been successful in improving the quality and expectancy of life of HIV patients as well as in reducing the likelihood of transmission of the disease. However, its success depends on high levels of adherence to the medication regimen, which is often difficult for patients to accomplish. For this reason, researchers have argued that real-time monitoring of adherence could have a positive impact on their ability to measure adherence and on patients&#039; adherence performance. This project proposes to accomplish real-time monitoring of adherence using a system that integrates sensors, wireless communications, and Internet technologies. The proposed system will be capable of acquiring information about patient&#039;s medicationconsumption and communicating such information to the appropriate personnel for real-time monitoring of adherence. The proposed system addresses several usability and sensing limitations of competing approaches. In particular, it will be capable of measuring partial dosing,  which can only be measured through patient reporting today. This system will be designed and tested by the research team that KandA Wireless has put together for this project, which involves experts on sensing, electronic design, wireless and Internet communications, and HIV ART adherence. The Phase 1 effort of this SBIR has proven that the proposed technology is feasible: 1) The sensing and processing approach used to estimate the pill-taking have been successfully developed and tested. 2) The electronics capable of acquiring, processing, and transmitting the medication consumption information have been designed and shown to be portable; and 3) The communication system to implement the remote real- time monitoring of adherence has beenspecified in detail taking usability, reliability, and information privacy into account. The information obtained from the completion of these milestones has been used to determine the target configuration of all the components of the system and to plan the proposed Phase 2. This Phase 2 will be focused on the full development of the proposed system and on the validation of the usability and accuracy of the system in the field. For this purpose, this Phase 2 effort has th following milestones: 1) Assemble each of the components of the proposed system; 2) Integrate all the components into a fully working system; 3) Evaluate the acceptability of the developed system with providers and patients; and 4) Conduct a validation trial to evaluate the accuracy of theproposed system in the field. In this form KandA Wireless expects to deliver by the end of this Phase 2 effort a working system with demonstrated adherence measuring accuracy, which can then be used to monitor, and even improve ART adherence.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The success of antiretroviral therapy in improving the life of HIV patients depends on high levels of adherence to the medication regimen [3, 4, 5]. Since such adherence requirements are challenging for the patient, researchers have suggested that real-time monitoring of adherence could positively impact adherence measurement accuracy and adherence rates [6]. This motivates the development of a system capable of keeping track of the patient&#039;s medication consumption through sensing technology and reporting such information to the provider in real-time.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposed SBIR Phase II renewal will leverage the technical expertise of academic collaborators at Georgia Institute of Technology and ongoing relationships forged with behavioral health professionals to introduce key technical innovations to our existing Behavior Imaging(R) telehealth system, and evaluate the enhanced system in two clinical assessment settings relevant to Autism Spectrum Disorders. These technical innovations will significantly improve ease of deployment and clinical utility of our system, resulting in a far more commercially viable product. The specific aims of the proposed project are: (1) To introduce hardware and software modifications to Behavior Capture, with simplified video capture on commodity smartphones and novel interactive features, including tags for target behaviors and the ability to flag examples of appropriate recordings; (2) To improve clinicians&#039; experience with our online Behavior Connect telehealth system through the design of modules that optimize their workflow and reduce the need for training, and (3) To conduct two clinical studies to demonstrate how the technology innovations impact clinical decision-making. The first of these studies will be conducted in collaboration with the Southwest Autism Research and Resource Center (SARRC) in Arizona, and will evaluate the use of the technology to streamline the process of diagnosis for autism using videos recorded by parents in the home. The second study will be conducted in collaboration with the Marcus Autism Center in Georgia, and will evaluate the use of the technology for assessment of severity and function of problem behavior, again, based on caregiver captured video of child behavior in the home.  Caring Technologies (now Behavior Imaging Solutions) successfully executed its Phase I and II research studies to partially develop and evaluate the research efficacy of its Behavior Imaging(R) telehealth technology to facilitate data collection and remote consultation/supervision for special educators and clinicians treating autism and other behavior disorders in classrooms. The company subsequently successfully launched its Behavior Imaging(R) consultation platform, and without institutional investment, generated 900K in revenue in 2010 for the technology&#039;s use primarily for (1) capturing and tracking the progress of special needs students, and (2) remotely supervising the delivery of in-home behavioral treatment. We anticipate that the proposed enhanced system, once validated in the clinical studies described in this proposal, will be adopted widely by the autism research and clinical community, and will significantly improve access to care among children with autism and developmental disabilities, as well as their families.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We intend to significantly enhance our existing telehealth system with hardware/software innovations and to validate its clinical performance for two important autism use cases. Enhancements based upon user feedback of our existing system will result in a far wider commercially acceptable product than we now have.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A large body of research has demonstrated the effectiveness of behavioral interventions in reducing HIV risk in diverse populations. Yet, despite  the utility of program replication kits and other science-based HIV prevention resources, the process of implementing evidence-based programs remains challenging for frontline HIV prevention providers, who often have limited knowledge and skills in the areas of program selection, planning, adaptation and evaluation. The HIV/AIDS Prevention Program Replication and Adaptation Online Professional Development Resource (HAPPRA) will address this need by creating a one-stop online resource to support frontline practitioners&#039; replication and adaptation of 10-12 efficacious HIV prevention programs. HAPPRA will combine: (1) digitized replication kits for 10-12 effective HIV/STI prevention programs from Sociometrics&#039; HIV/AIDS Prevention Program Archive (HAPPA) and Program Archive on Sexuality, Health and Adolescence (PASHA); (2) an hour-long interactive, multimedia course on replicating and adapting each included prevention program; (3) four brief (half-hour) multimedia overview courses on the fundamentals of HIV prevention program replication and adaptation, and (4) diverse technical assistance and information exchange modalities, including webinars, live   Ask the Expert   forums, live-chat technical assistance, a community blog, a practitioner forum, case studies, and FAQs aimed at building a community of practice around the effective programs. Continuing education credits will be offered for each training course through the American Psychological Association (APA), the National Commission for Health Education Credentialing (NCHEC), and the National Association of Social Workers (NASW). This combination of traditional and Web 2.0 capacity building methods meets the call for new strategies to improve the dissemination and utilization of science-based HIV resources and will support a community of practice of HIV prevention practitioners withvaried needs, learning styles and technology preferences. Product impacts will be assessed through a fidelity study with 50 community/faith-based organizations to determine if and how access to HAPPRA resources improves implementation fidelity. The creation of this project will (1) expand the dissemination and implementation of proven HIV prevention programs; (2) contribute to greater implementation fidelity in HIV prevention programming, which has been linked to positive HIV risk reduction behavioral outcomes; (3) address the capacity building needs of frontline HIV prevention practitioners in a cost-effective manner; (4) increase our understanding of how practitioners use different technology transfer modalities to translate research into practice; and (5) facilitate th development of a new online community of practice of HIV prevention practitioners.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this SBIR project is to design a cost-effective, lightweight, integrated, whole-head dense-array electroencephalography and near-infrared spectroscopy (dEEG/NIRS) brain imaging and data analysis system for non-invasive recording of brain activity in neonates and young children. This system will permit bedside monitoring of immediate at-risk neonates, and early identification and intervention for abnormalities that predict developmental disabilities and cognitive deficits. A dense array of 128 combined optoelectrodes sitting on the surface of the scalp will simultaneously record brain electrical activity (EEG), and cerebral blood oxygenation changes (NIRS), providing complementary measures of brain function. Having demonstrated feasibility in Phase I with a partial array and single modulated wavelength, the first Specific Aim in Phase II is to extend the approach to complete a commercially viable, whole-head and dual-wavelength dEEG/NIRS acquisition system for infants. The existing design will be modified to use dual-wavelength LED emitters for hemoglobin measurements, with enhanced stability and robustness of the integrated optoelectrodes. New architecture will modulate up to 64 NIR light sources (32 dual-wavelength LEDs) at different frequencies and demodulate signals from up to 96 detectors. NIRS data acquisition software will be refined and further improvements will be made to the integration and synchronization with other acquisition streams, including Net Station EEG, Polygraphic Input Box data (e.g., ECG, EMG), and E-Prime experimental control software. The second Specific Aim is to design commercial, advanced data analysis tools for accurate computation of blood oxygenation changes measured with integrateddEEG/NIRS sensors. This NIRS analysis software will complement EGI&#039;s existing EEG processing and source analysis software. The first step will be to implement standard computational tools (based on the modified Beer-Lambert equation) that are used to determine changes in oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin as measured by recovered NIR signals. Then, the computational parameters will be refined through advanced anatomical infant head modeling, and numerical modeling of the path, scattering, and absorption properties of NIR light through infant head tissues. The third Specific Aim will test and validate the integrated dEEG/NIRS system hardware and software for data integrity, functionality, and usability. Simultaneous dEEG and NIR data will be collected with the complete 128-sensor system during resting state and functional tasks in 30 neonates. The functional data task wil present simple speech and matched non-speech sounds that have previously resulted in individual differences in brain electrical patterns predictive of later dyslxia diagnosis. Outputs from in-house NIRS analysis tools will be cross validated with existing open-source analysis tools (e.g., HomER). Usability of the acquisition and analysis software will be assessed and further refinements made. Finally,commercial user guides for hardware, acquisition software, and analysis software will be prepared to accompany the dEEG/NIRS acquisition and analysis product.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to develop the first lightweight device capable of providing real-time spatial and temporal brain imaging information regarding newborn and young infant neural functioning. Such a development would facilitate bedside monitoring of immediate at-risk newborns and offer us the incredible opportunity to identify in very young infants the structural and functional abnormalities that may contribute to later emerging developmental disabilities. Such early identification is vital to the development of early  interventions that may mitigate or even preclude the emergence of the disorder.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Significance: Almost 30% of U.S. adults have pre-diabetes. Without weight loss and changes in physical activity and diet, more than 50% of them will eventually develop type 2 diabetes (T2DM), with its increased risk ofcardiovascular disease and many other complications. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) proved that lifestyle changes involving weight loss, increased physical activity and dietary changes can delay or prevent the onset of T2DM in pre-diabetics. However, intensive interventions like DPP are expensive (DPP:  1,399/person) and demanding of both patient and professional time. As a result, despite the critical need to prevent progression to T2DM, prevention programs have not been embodied in effective, low-cost, real-world interventions that can assist millions of pre-diabetics. Objectives: The overall goal of this fast-track proposal is to produce a commercializable product aimed at changing physical activity, diet and weight loss behaviors of pre-diabetics.The specific aims are to 1) Adapt an existing successful email/Internet wellness program to focus on prediabetics; 2) Conduct a randomized trial of effectiveness in changing weight, glucose and physical activity in pre-diabetics; 3) Provide data on cost and participation, for commercialization and future phase 3 trials. Methods:   Alive   is an email-delivered intervention to improve physical activity and diet, developed through an R01 to Kaiser Permanente. In a randomized controlled trial, Alive significantly improved all of its target behaviors. The latest version, through an SBIR grant, has added automated tailored print and phone counseling, social networking and a substantial emphasis on weight control. Alive will now be modified to focus on pre-diabetes and the behaviors required for its effective control. The modified program will be delivered over I year through 3 channels (email/internet, phone, print), and will use computerized algorithms to deliver highly individualized weekly goal-setting and motivational support. In the clinical trial, pre-diabetics will be identified through the Kaiser Permanente member database. At clinic visits at baseline, 3 and 12 months, weight and measures of glycemic control will be obtained. Subjects will be randomly assigned to the modified program, Alive-PD, or a control condition representing usual care of pre-diabetics. There is statistical power to detect a clinically meaningful difference between the two groups in weight loss and glycemic control (A1c). Effectiveness, proportion reached, participation and cost will be reported. Impact: A low-cost program such as this could reach thousands or millions of prediabetics with a behavior- change intervention, at a fraction of the cost of in-person or group approaches. If proven effective at improving weight loss and glycemic control in a randomized trial, it could become an important component of the standard of care for prediabetics as a stand-alone service, as a complement to pre-diabetes education classes, and as an important reinforcer of physician and nurse practitioner recommendations.",

In addition to the damaging effects of stress on nurses&#039; health and well being, stress is also a major contributor to attrition and widespread shortages in the nursing profession. Although there exist promising in-person interventions for addressing problems of stress among nurses, the experience of our group across multiple projects in hospitals has indicated that the schedules and workloads of nurses can pose problems for implementing in-person interventions, and that web-based interventions might be ideally suited to addressing the high levels of stress among nurses. In recent years, Internet-based stress management programs have been developed and tested in the workplace, and the evidence from several studies, including a recent study conducted by our organization in a hospital setting, has indicated that a web-based stress management programscan be an efficacious intervention for reducing stress among nurses.  The overall goal of this Fast-Track project is to develop and test a web-based stress management program for nurses, supported by a specialized web application and accompanied by a web-based nurse manager&#039;s guide directed mainly at improvements in the work environment. In Phase I, prototypes of a nurses stress management program and a nurse managers&#039; guide will be developed and a feasibility test will conducted on the nurses stress management prototype. In Phase II, the web-based stress management program for nurses and the nurse managers&#039; guide will be fully developed, and the nurses stress management program will be tested in a randomized controlled trial with 300 nurses at Mt.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ischemic Stroke continues to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Currently approved thrombolytic therapy suffers for a narrow therapeutic window and clearly other therapeutic strategies areneeded, such as neuroprotective or restorative agents. Unfortunately the quest for a therapeutic remains beset by a history of failed clinical trials involving promising neuroprotective candidates. Instead of targeting a single pathway in the cascade leading to ischemic neuronal damage, treatment with multifunctional compounds or supplements of endogenous multi-role factors might be better choices for preventing ischemic brain injury. One of the most exciting areas of research for treatment of cerebral ischemia is the use of angiogenic growth factors, agents that exert direct neuroprotective effects and augment blood flow to the ischemic region. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) a neurotrophic factor, reduces cerebral infarct size, augments cerebral blood flowand promotes neuritogenesis and synaptogenesis, the growth of mature, functional neurons specifically in the peri-infarct region or penumbra. While administration of HGF as gene or protein therapy has potential for the treatment of ischemic stroke, the therapeutic feasibility of this approach is limited by the presence of the blood-brain-barrier, and other issues such as immune and inflammatory responses evoked by adenovirus proteins, inherent instability of proteins in solution, their limited tissue half-life and cost-prohibitive production. We have identified BB3, an organic small-molecule HGF mimetic that crosses the blood brain barrier, exerts neuroprotective effects (even when administered in a delayed setting) and augments post ischemic blood flow inrat models of temporary and permanent mid-cerebral artery occlusion, tMCAO and pMCAO, respectively. More recently under rigorously controlled studies, we have confirmed the activity of BB3 at Angion and independently in the laboratory of Dr. David Warner,Duke University. Excitingly, Dr Warner&#039;s group has demonstrated a significant effect of BB3 both on infarct size and neurologic function at day 28 in both permanent and temporary models of mid-cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in the rat, when first dosed 6hours after occlusion. This research effort under SBIR phase II funding is near completion and we look to further validate the drug as potential therapy for stroke under the guideline of the Stroke Therapy Academic Industry Roundtable (STAIR) of 1999, which still remains the standard for preclinical drug development for stroke neuroprotective and restorative drugs. The additional pre-clinical studies proposed here will satisfy these guidelines as promulgated by STAIR under a collaborative effort with Dr. Warner and Dr. Cenk Ayata of Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). Upon completion of the pre-clinical studies, we propose to enter the clinic by conducting a dose-escalating safety trial in stroke patients at MGH with Dr Karen Furie, Director MGH Stroke Services.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Ischemic stroke is a major cause of death in the United States. Unfortunately attempts at finding new neuroprotective therapies have failed miserably in clinical trials. BB3/Refanalin, a small molecular weight mimetic of HGF has been shown to protect brain cells in animal models and may prove to be a novel therapy to treat ischemic stroke.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective is to design, implement, and clinically assess a portable, user-worn, bradykinesia feature extraction system, BradyXplore  , for integration with Great Lake Neurotechnologies&#039; (GLN) Kinesia and Kinesia HomeView technology platforms for objective Parkinson&#039;s disease (PD) monitoring. There has been tremendous research into PD treatments including pharmaceutical interventions and deep brain stimulation (DBS). While tremor is often the most visible symptom, bradykinesia can be the most impairing. The current standard in evaluating bradykinesia is the Unified Parkinson&#039;s Disease Rating Scale, a subjective, qualitative ranking system. Scoring instructions for bradykinesia integrate multiple movement features intoa single score that increases variability and limits exploration into if particular bradykinesia features are influenced by specific treatments. If different bradykinesia features were better quantified, novel therapies may be developed to target specificbradykinesia manifestations. The proposed innovations include 1) compact, user-worn motion sensors that can be used with web-based software on a home computer or tablet, 2) algorithms that use kinematic data to rate speed, amplitude, and rhythm independently, and 3) web-based applications for system delivery, patient interaction, and symptom reporting, all of which will promote clinical acceptance and a self- sustaining business model. Wireless motion sensor units containing accelerometers and gyroscopes will be worn on the finger and thumb and collect synchronized motion data. BradyXplore will independently rate speed, amplitude, and rhythm for the standard repetitive motion tasks. Sensor unit batteries will be recharged by an inductive, USB charge pad to eliminate the need for patients to fidget with small connectors. When sensor units are placed on the pad, kinematic data will be transferred to the patient&#039;s computer or tablet via a wireless link and then uploaded to our HIPAA-compliant server. In Phase I,our existing motion sensor unit was successfully upgraded to reduce size and improve sensitivity. Algorithms were developed for independently rating speed, amplitude, and rhythm. The algorithms output scores highly correlated to clinical ratings and demonstrated a differential response of speed, amplitude, and rhythm to medication. Phase II will improve ergonomics, sensitivity, data transfer, and reporting. Hardware will be upgraded to include two synchronized sensor units that recharge via an inductive pad and transfer data via a low-power radio. Software will be modified to be completely web-based so patients need not install any software. BradyXplore algorithms will be further investigated in a clinical study to demonstrate its test-retest reliability compared to clinical ratings and determine if speed, amplitude, and rhythm fluctuate differentially ON DBS. We hypothesize that BradyXplore will 1) provide a standardized platform for bradykinesia assessment that objectively quantifies speed, amplitude, andrhythm, 2) receive high clinical acceptance from both clinicians and patients, and 3) aid in development, evaluation, and optimization of therapies such as DBS and pharmaceutical interventions.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Parkinson&#039;s disease affectsapproximately 1.5 million people in the United States causing motor symptoms, of which one of the most debilitating is bradykinesia (slowed movements). Bradykinesia is currently evaluated using a subjective rating scale that gives a single score taking into account speed, amplitude, fatiguing, hesitations, arrests in movement, and how these variables change over time. The proposed BradyXplore bradykinesia feature extraction system will separately quantify specific features of bradykinesia (speed, amplitude,and rhythm) in the home, which should aid in the development of novel therapies to target a patient&#039;s specific bradykinesia manifestations.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Synthonics is developing the metal-coordinated levodopa drug product, MCP-311, for FDA approval. Levodopa has served as a primary pharmacotherapy for patients with Parkinson&#039;s disease (PD) for 40 years and it remains uniquely effective. However, replacing dopamine by administering levodopa in a standard formulations results in pulsatile delivery, characterized by a series of peaks and troughs in the plasma profile. Optimized profiles for levodopa in plasma can be achieved with continuous dopaminergic delivery (CDD) to provide a more natural continuous dopaminergic stimulation (CDS) of the brain&#039;s nigrostriatal pathway. The benefits of CDD can be observed in patients using Duodopa (Abbott). With infusion-like steady plasmalevodopa levels comes a decreased incidence of motor complications and maintenance of plasma drug levels within a narrowing therapeutic window. There is an unmet clinical need for an orally administered levodopa product that provides plasma profiles similar to that provided by intestinal infusion. In addition to improving therapeutic outcomes in late stage patients, providing CDD from the beginning of drug therapy holds great promise for avoiding motor complications later. Some speculate that avoiding pulsatile delivery may slow the progression of PD. Synthonics found that bismuth forms a stable coordination complex with levodopa to form bismuth subdopate, the active ingredient in MCP-311. Synthonics&#039; data from pilot oral studies in animals are consistent with the hypothesis that this new molecular entity adhered to the stomach lining upstream of the intestinal active absorption sites, forming a drug depot from which levodopa was released gradually as gastric acids acted on the compound. Synthonics seeks touse its metal coordinated chemistry to control the release of levodopa from this depot to provide CDD in an orally administered product. Synthonics proposes to develop MCP-311 as a treatment for the symptoms of PD. The research plan is designed to acquiredata to support a 505(b)(2) investigational new drug application. Once in clinical development, MCP-311 will be compared with Sinemet-CR for levodopa and with DevromTM (bismuth subgallate), an OTC internal deodorant, for bismuth exposure. The preclinical development will consist of 4 specific aims. First, to fine tune analytical methods and controls, develop a cGMP synthesis and prepare clinical trial material. Second, to develop a formulation to optimize dispersion to allow for in vivo polymerization of the drug substance. Third, to perform pharmacology studies in an advanced animal model to characterize the relevant pharmacokinetics and optimize formulation. Fourth, to use the results of these studies to develop a clinical plan. The ultimate goal is to market a simple and reliable levodopa oral product to provide significant and practical clinical benefits.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project is a drug development program designed to 1) develop an oral suspension formulation of bismuth subdopatefor human administration and 2) conduct and complete the chemistry, manufacturing and controls and nonclinical studies required to support an Investigational New Drug application (IND) for MCP-311, a metal-coordinated pharmaceutical (MCP) new drug product.After oral administration, the bismuth subdopate suspension is intended to coat the stomach and form a polymeric film that serves as drug delivery depot to release levodopa continuously over time, and provide a continuous dopaminergic delivery (CDD) for Parkinson&#039;s disease patients through maintenance of steady state therapeutic systemic levodopa concentrations over an extended time period. The relevance to public health comes in the form of a better drug therapy for Parkinson&#039;s disease that addresses theunmet medical need for CDD by using the MCP approach as a tool to achieve a more continuous infusion-like drug delivery from an orally administered levodopa product.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): IMMERSIVETOUCH(R) VIRTUAL REALITY-HAPTIC NEUROSURGERY SIMULATOR: CRANIOTOMY AND ANEURYSM CLIPPING Founded by principal investigator Dr. Pat Banerjee, ImmersiveTouch,(R) Inc. (Westmont, Illinois) is a small business thatdevelops fully immersive, visio-haptic virtual reality software engineered into a hardware workstation for the training of surgical residents. The Company&#039;s simulator provides residents with repeated, collocated virtual reality-haptic practice needed to accelerate learning and impart skills for the operating room without risk to patients. Brain (intracranial) aneurysm rupture is common and is associated with high mortality and morbidity. The surgical treatment of aneurysms is challenging, requiring a longtraining period. Such training is mandated. The ACGME Residency Review Committee for Neurological Surgery stipulates that resident case load   should include craniotomies for trauma, neoplasms, aneurysms, and vascular malformations  . Since the ImmersiveTouch simulator has already been educationally validated for ventriculostomy, we propose here to validate it for aneurysm clipping at the MCA (middle cerebral artery) bifurcation. There is increasing pressure on resident training in classic microneurosurgeryby open craniotomy and aneurysm clipping. This is due to a reduction in resident work hours and a decreasing case load in aneurysm clipping, with more than half of simpler aneurysms treated with endovascular means. Additional means of training neurosurgeons to become competent at aneurysm clipping is now necessary. At University of Illinois at Chicago, which is a project partner along with University of Chicago, more than 90 percent of aneurysms requiring clipping form on arteries that arise from the internal carotid artery, including the MCA at the M1-M2 branch? This surgery is performed through a pterional craniotomy followed by dissection along the Sylvian fissure (where the MCA, its branches, and the aneurysm are located). The simulation will teach a pterional craniotomy, dural opening, navigation along a pre-dissected Sylvian fissure, clipping of the aneurysm and blood flow testing to ensure adequate clipping and patency of the adjacent vessels. Phase I converted patient CT voxel data into a 3D virtualreality-haptic model of an MCA bifurcation aneurysm and the Sylvian fissure, etc. We also modeled aneurysm clips in 3D. Phase II focuses on programming the simulator for craniotomy, dural opening, and aneurysm clipping, and on validation.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: ImmersiveTouch Inc. develops innovative augmented virtual reality systems for training of neurosurgical residents. In collaboration with the University of Illinois at Chicago and University of Chicago, the Partnership proposes to conduct research to overcome some of the current technical barriers. If successful, following STTR Phases I and II, the ImmersiveTouch-Sensimmer Neurosurgical Trainer will overcome challenges leading to evaluation of craniotomy and cerebral aneurysm clipping and other derivative neurosurgical procedures,",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Type II Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS), also known as Hunter&#039;s syndrome, is a genetic disease that affects the lysosomal enzyme, iduronate-2-sulfatase (IDS). Consequently, patients with MPS-II develop extensive lysosomal storage product accumulation in tissues, including the brain. Children born with MPS-II develop multiple brain disorders including mental retardation and hydrocephalus. The current therapy for MPS-II is Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT) with the recombinanthuman enzyme, IDS. However, ERT does not treat the brain of MPS-II, because IDS does not cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The present work will continue work on the development of a new treatment of the brain of MPS-II, which is a genetically engineered biopharmaceutical fusion protein. The IDS is genetically fused to a BBB molecular Trojan horse, which is a genetically engineered peptidomimetic monoclonal antibody (MAb) against an endogenous BBB peptide receptor, the human insulin receptor (HIR). The human IDS is fused to the heavy chain of the HIRMAb to create a new chemical entity, called the HIRMAb-IDS fusion protein. Phase I studies show the HIRMAb-IDS fusion protein could be engineered and expressed by stably transfected host cells. The fusion protein retained high affinity binding to the HIR and retained high IDS enzyme activity. The proposed phase II work will develop a manufacturing plan that can be replicated for future GMP manufacturing. The AGT-182 produced in phase II will be evaluated for safety, toxicology and pharmacokinetics in 8 Rhesus monkeys. The completion of this work will enable entry of the AGT-182 drug development program into GLP toxicology and GMP manufacturing required for submission of an IND to begin treatment of the brain inpatients with MPS-II.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mucopolysacchridosis Type II, or Hunter&#039;s Syndrome, patients develop severe brain abrormalities, owing to the genetic defect in the gene encoding the lysosomal enzyme, iduronate-2-sulphatase (IDS). Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is not effective for the brain, because the IDS does not cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). This research will develop a new treatment for the brain in patients with Hunter&#039;s Syndrome, which involves the re-engineering of human IDS as a fusion protein that crosses the human BBB.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The neuromuscular disorders include a wide group of conditions ranging from relatively mild focal problems, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, to severe, generalized diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Current methods for evaluating these disorders remain limited to a variety of tests and procedures that are either invasive or remarkably qualitative in nature. One newer technique, electrical impedance myography (EIM), offers the prospect of obtaining quantitative data on muscle condition painlessly and non-invasively. However, no commercial devices specifically tailored for EIM use exist, with nearly all previous EIM work relying upon off-the-shelf bioimpedance devices designed for   whole-body   rather than single-muscle assessment. In Phase 1 of this SBIR, Convergence Medical Devices, Inc (CMD) developed an initial prototype system to test proof-of-principle innovative concepts in circuit design and data acquisition to provide highly sensitive and accurate data at an extended frequency range (out to 10 MHz) and over multiple angles relative to the major muscle fiber direction. This work was followed by supplemental work that produced the first hand-held device with robust electronics capable of similar measurements with a detachable, interchangeable electrode array. In this 3-year Phase 2 SBIR, CMD proposes to further refine that technology so as to assist in disease diagnosis and for following disease progression, with a specific focus on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In Aim 1 of the proposed grant, testing of multiple electrode array designs will be performed on a group of normal subjects and those with ALS to determine which electrode array designs offer the greatest reproducibility and ability to discriminate healthy from diseased individuals. In Aim 2, the device  and the 3   best   array designs identified in Aim 1 will be tested in 30 ALS patients, 30 patients with syndromes mimicking ALS (e.g., polyradiculopathy and motor-predominant neuropathy), and30 subjects with suspected/possible ALS to determine the single best array design for diagnosis and to determine its sensitivity and specificity. This study will take place at CMD and four external sites and will be managed by the Northeast ALS trials Consortium (NEALS), the premier organization for overseeing clinical trials in ALS. In Aim 3, the 30 suspected/possible ALS patients recruited in SA2 and 30 additional suspected/possible ALS patients will be assessed monthly using EIM and the 3 arrays identified in SA1. All subjects will also undergo standard measurements of disease progression including handheld dynamometry, ALS Functional Rating Scale, and spirometry. The best array design for assessing disease progression will be identified and compared toconventional markers of disease progression to determine EIM&#039;s sensitivity to disease status. Thus, at the conclusion of this research program, we anticipate having developed and vigorously tested an EIM device and associated electrode designs that together will serve as a powerful new diagnostic and monitoring tool for neuromuscular disease.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The neuromuscular disorders are a group of conditions that impact the lives of millions of people in the United States alone. In thisstudy, Convergence Medical Devices, in collaboration with neurologists at several medical centers, will develop and test a new device based on the concept of electrical impedance myography, a technique that offers the promise of rapid and accurate diseaseassessment. With the completion of this study, a new, painless tool will be developed and studied that will assist in individual patient care and will speed drug testing in clinical trials in diseases ranging from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and muscular dystrophy to radiculopathy and polyneuropathy.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project aims to develop new targeted fluorogenic substrates capable of measuring lysosomal enzyme activity in living cells and tissues. If successful, the proposed research will provide breakthroughs needed to advance the discovery of promising new therapies and modulating drugs for lysosomal storage diseases and allied medical applications. In Phase I of this project, Marker Gene Technologies, Inc. established the feasibility of the technology by preparing new fluorogenic glycosidase, esterase, phosphatase, lipase and sulfatase substrates for lysosomal enzymes and demonstrated differential staining in living cells that were from normal or were of disease origin or upon induction of inhibition of lysosomal enzyme activities. In Phase II, these and additional new substrates will be assayed in vitro for their ability to measure specific and localized inhibition or induction of lysosomal enzymes in living cells as well as differentiate individual enzyme activities in a cell- or tissue-specific manner. These new systems will be validated for use in high-throughput screening for drug discovery, for use in clinical diagnostics to evaluate the occurrence and progression of disease,and for use in monitoring the effectiveness of existing or emerging therapeutic interventions for these disorders. The new substrates and the resulting detection systems will also provide innovative methods to quantitate lysosomal enzyme function and to screen for the influence of secondary drug or protein administration, making them useful medical research tools for a variety of significant biochemical and medical applications. The company has engaged the collaboration of several noted research laboratories and institutions as well as major pharmaceutical companies in this arena, who are eager to test the methods and systems in their existing clinical applications. The resulting assays and products will be marketed to the research, pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic industries. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The success of this project opens up enormous commercial possibilities in the fields of medical intervention in lysosomal storage disorders such as Sandhoff&#39;s disease, Tay-Sachs syndrome, Krabbi&#39;s disease and Gaucher&#39;s disease through discovery of new proteins and drugs for use in modulating lysosomal enzyme activity in these and other related diseases. These assays will also enable clinicians to determine the efficacy of current and emergingtherapies as well as add a new set of clinical diagnostic assays for patient assessment. In addition, it will lead to commercial and licensable products in these areas.\n",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): MRI is a proven non-invasive technique that makes high resolution image of the brain. Echo planar imaging (EPI) is the most widely used MRI technique used for neurosciences due to its extremely fast imaging speed and unique contrast mechanisms. EPI combined with diffusion sensitive gradient pulses provides 3D visualization of axonal fibers, which reveals the connectional anatomy of the human brain. EPI is also nearly exclusively used for functional MRI (fMRI) given its extremely high sensitivity to changes in   blood oxygen level dependent   (BOLD) contrast in different regions of the brain, revealing maps of neuronal activity. We are proposing to develop a family of highly efficient new EPI sequences for diffusion and fMRI providing several times faster imaging of the brain. This new faster imaging technique works by multiplexing several images within the single-shot echo train, to produce several images instead of a single EPI image from a each train of signals, whereasonly a single image is produced in the normal EPI pulse sequence. The new Multiplexed EPI imaging sequence will largely replace the use of the original EPI sequence invented by Peter Mansfield in 1978 that to date has been used for all neuroscience and clinical brain imaging. The availability of these Multiplexed EPI techniques will give researchers and clinicians the capability of performing high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) in scan times reduced from 25 minutes to 8 or 12 minutes scans andthese scan times will be more tolerable by both patients and research subjects. The multiplexed EPI can scan many times faster or instead be used to provide more images that are thinner for higher resolution and reduced artifacts. The greatly acceleratedscan times of the whole brain will enable new experiments in functional MRI at 7 Tesla and 3 Tesla. The sequence will be designed, implemented and evaluated on MRI scanners operating at 3T at University of California Berkeley and San Francisco and at 7T and 10.5T at University of Minnesota. Once the Multiplexed EPI sequence is fully evaluated and optimized, it will be made into a useful tool for basic and clinical neuroscience research, and for clinical diagnostic imaging.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is a multi-systemic, recessively inherited disorder that affects between 1 in 40,000 to 1 in 100,000 individuals worldwide. It is characterized primarily by early onset cerebellar ataxia andtelangiectasia, from which the disease name is derived. In addition, patients also exhibit a number of other clinical symptoms including increased susceptibility to cancer (lymphomas, leukemia, brain tumors), immunodeficiency, insulin-resistant diabetes, chromosomal instability, sensitivity to ionizing radiation, susceptibility to bronchopulmonary disease, and the absence, or almost complete absence, of a thymus. Current treatments for A-T are directed toward the management of symptoms. Physical and speechtherapy can improve the lives of patients, and  -globulin injections can be given to support the immune system. However, no treatment is directed at the underlying defect. Consequently, A-T remains a fatal disease. The development of improved therapies forA-T is currently limited by the lack of an animal model that fully, and accurately, recapitulates the multi-systemic nature of this disease. A number of mouse models of A-T have been developed over the years by the targeted disruption of the mouse Atm gene, and these models have proved invaluable for studying some aspects of ATM function and A-T disease. However, no single mouse model fully replicates the complex clinical symptoms observed in human disease, and more importantly, none of the murine models develop the severe neurological phenotype that is the hallmark of human A-T disease. The failure of mouse models to develop the classical symptoms of A-T is likely the result of physiological, anatomical, and developmental differences between the two species. In contrast, pigs may serve as a better model in which to study human disease given that their development, anatomy, and physiology are more closely related to that of humans. Given that the development and anatomy of the pig brain more closely resembles that of humans than mice, mutations in the porcine ATM gene may result in many of the same neurological changes that are observed in A-T patients. Therefore, the ultimate goal of this proposal is to develop and commercialize a porcine model of A-T by disrupting the ATM gene. We intend to accomplish this in two steps by combining gene-targeting and somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). In this proposal, ATM+/- fetal fibroblasts that  were developed in Phase I will be used as nuclear donors for somatic cellnuclear transfer. Nuclear transfer embryos will be transferred to recipient females for gestation. Resulting piglets will have one targeted ATM gene. We will breed heterozygotes to produce ATM-/- pigs and perform a thorough molecular, biochemical, and physiological characterization. Finally, we will establish long-term breeding herds. This project is intended to produce a porcine model of ataxia-telangiectasia that will provide academic and industry researchers with an opportunity to better understand theconsequences of ATM dysfunction, the pathogenesis of A-T disease, and provide an improved model in which to develop and test new therapeutic strategies.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal specifically outlines the development, initial characterization, and propagation of genetically engineered porcine model of the human disease, ataxia-telangiectasia. This project is relevant to the NIH&#039;s mission because it will provide a resource to stimulate discovery, therapeutic application, and the development of new diagnostic tools.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clinical science and its translation into preventive and clinical patient care are the primary means by which the nation&#039;s health care goals are fulfilled. NIH&#039;s broad mission to improve health outcomes for all people can only be achieved if scientific advances are transformed into improvements in public health. As emphasized throughout the NIH Roadmap, there is a critical need to build our nation&#039;s research capacity for clinical and translational research so that findings can be more quickly and effectively translated into clinica practice. This Phase II SBIR project will continue the research and development of Research Implementation and Management System (RIMS), the first integrated system of online research tools specifically designed to meet the needs of clinical and translational scientists in the socia and behavioral fields. Through efficient, cost- effective, and tailored research implementation and management tools, RIMS will harness the Internet&#039;s power to effectively increase research capacity. RIMS will integrate and streamline all needed research activities from recruitment and retention to human participant protections to data collection and database management. RIMS will be broadly applicable, providing customizable tools that can be easily integrated into a research protocol. Further, RIMS&#039; online tools are built on robust, HIPAA-compliant data security standards. No other product provides a comprehensive suite of integrated research implementation and management tools tailored to the needs of social/behavioral researchers. Phase I feasibility test results with researchers provide strong support for continued development and testing of RIMS. During Phase II, we will build on Phase I feedback to finalize the fully functioning web-based product and conduct a field test examining the degree to which RIMS enhances the quality, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness of clinical and translational research. This Phase II project will accomplish three specific aims: 1) Full product development and usability testing with clinical and translational researchers in the social and behavioral sciences (PIs, Project Coordinators, and Research Staff; n=20 per group); 2) Field testing in collaboration with 12 research teams to examine the impact of RIMS over a 6-month period in cost-effectiveness, time efficiency, recruitment and retention, data quality, and satisfaction; and  3) finalizing the product based on test results and user evaluations. Over the course of 3-C ISD&#039;s work with research scientists, it has become clear there is a large unmet need and demand for web-based research management tools, particularly in social and behavioral fields (see letters of support). By making such technologies affordable and broadly applicable,RIMS has the potential to significantly advance the research capacity of clinical and translational research through high quality, time-efficient, and cost-effective research management and implementation tools. As a result, our nation&#039;s ability to transform research findings into improved health outcomes can be strengthened and accelerated.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: NIH&#039;s mission to improve health outcomes for all people emphasizes the need to accelerate and strengthen clinical and translational research. Technology can play a vital role in achieving this goal through web-based tools for researchers that allow them to conduct, disseminate, and translate their research more efficiently and with higher quality. Currently, comprehensive web-based tools are rarely used in the service of clinical or translational research in the social and behavioral sciences. Social and behavioral research plays a critical role in advancing the understanding and prevention of public health problems, both at the individual level (e.g., drug and alcohol abuse) and at the systems level (e.g., health economics, delivery systems). The treatment and prevention of diabetes, obesity, drug abuse, violence, and myriad other public health concerns depend on good research that is conducted cost-effectively and translated efficiently. The proposed Research Implementation Management System (RIMS) will offer a suite of online research tools to streamline the various activities needed to conduct clinical and translational research in thesocial and behavioral sciences, including recruitment, retention, human participant protections, measure construction, data collection, and database management. This product will be developed and tested in response to the needs of clinical and translational researchers across a broad array of social and behavioral fields. The underlying web-based technology infrastructure of RIMS will be broadly applicable, providing customizable tools that can be easily integrated into a research protocol. RIMS will bridge geographic barriers by giving researchers with fewer institutional supports for research equal access to affordable, flexible technology. In effect, this SBIR will be  able to support the research of scientists across multiple NIH Institutes, with particular relevanc for the National Institute for Mental Health (NIMH), National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), National Institute on Aging (NIA), and the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD). Bringing the RIMS product to market would broadly support NIH&#039;s mission to improve public health outcomes through strengthening capacity of clinical and translational science.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Aggregation in antibody therapeutics is a topic of increasing concern in the biopharmaceutical industry, as these aggregates are believed to play an undesirable role resulting in adverse health effects to patients by inducing immunogenicity, altering therapeutic pharmacokinetics, or decreasing efficacy of the drug product. While methods are available to count (and in some cases, image) visible, and to a lesser extent sub-visible, particles, there is currently no reliableway to count and identify aggregates with sizes smaller than 1 micron. Studies on the mechanism of antibody aggregation indicate a process of formation that begins with very small sub-micron sized seed aggregates, which suggests the value of sub-micron characterization as a predictive indicator of therapeutic stability. It is hypothesized that humanized antibody therapeutics break B-cell tolerance by presenting the self-antigen in a   foreign   array through ordered packing in aggregates; not unlike the mechanism by which viruses elicit a vigorous immune response. This poses the question-what are the cutting-edge technologies utilized by scientists to study the size, shape, and morphology of viruses, and are these technologies applicable to the problem of sub-micron aggregate characterization? Molecular microscopy is a non-invasive molecular imaging technology that uses advanced specimen preparation and imaging methods designed specifically to visualize complex biological samples, under conditions close to their native state. For well-ordered samples such as viruses, and virus-antibody complexes, the achievable resolution can be lt 0.4 nm. In order to address the problem of quantitative sub- micron aggregate characterization of monoclonal antibody therapeutics, our technology applies high- throughput molecular microscopy to directly visualize antibody monomers and aggregates at multiple scales of magnification to provide quantitative measures of antibody aggregate count, size, shape, and morphology as well asantibody monomer loss in a single experiment. This technology utilizes a complex and expensive TEM instrument and automated software that requires a significant level of expertise to achieve reliable and high- throughput results, and is thus not readily accessible as an in-house method. We propose to make this technology available by incorporating a robust   Antibody Therapeutic Submicron Aggregate Characterization   service into the armamentarium of fee-for-service TEM capabilities that we already offer tothe biopharmaceutical industry. To this end, our Phase II proposal has the following milestones: 1) Defining technology specifications and limitations in quantitative terms that are meaningful to antibody therapeutic formulations and characterization scientists, in consultation with protein therapeutic characterization expert, Dr. Kogan Bao (Allergan Pharmaceuticals, CA); 2) Validating the technology through comparison to accepted methodologies, in partnership with protein aggregation expert, Dr. John Carpenter (UC Denver, CO); and 3) Developing and implementing software algorithms to enhance technology throughput in a cost-effective manner. This will prepare us for Phase III, when we will provide trial service offerings to a select number of our existing pharmaceutical and biotechnology clients.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Aggregation in antibody therapeutics is a topic of increasing concern in the biopharmaceutical industry, because these aggregates are believed to play an undesirable role resulting inadverse health effects to patients; as a result, there is increasing pressure from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to develop quantitative characterization tools for submicron aggregate particles in biopharmaceutical drug products. Our technology applies high-throughput molecular microscopy to identify and quantify sub-micron protein aggregates in antibody therapeutics. These new analytical methods will contribute to the armamentarium of analytical techniques aimed at helping reduce costs and improvesafety and efficacy of antibody therapeutics.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hearing impairment/deafness is the most common sensory limitation in the U.S. An estimated 11 million individuals in the US are deaf or hard-of-hearing. It has been estimated that approximately 1 million Americans use American Sign Language (ASL) as their primary means of communication making it a distinct linguistic minority. This proposal seeks to improve clinical practice by creating a computerized, self-administered depression screener in ASL that is culturally and linguistically accessible to deaf individuals, an  at-risk and traditionally underserved population. No current depression screeners have been shown to be valid for the majority of prelingually deaf persons who use ASL as their main communication mode. Studies have shown that depression occurs in higher rates among deaf persons than hearing persons. While the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommended systematic screening for depression in primary care clinical settings in 2002, deaf persons have not yet routinely had access to this preventive service. Providing primary care physicians with a depression screener that is culturally and linguistically accurate and can be self-administered via computer and can be used on iPads and iPhones with no further development, can greatly increase the chance that deaf persons with depression will receive proper diagnostic assessment and treatment which can substantially improve their quality of life. The Deaf Depression Screener will also improve scientific knowledgeby providing a valid method for estimating the prevalence of depression among deaf persons in primary care which cannot now be accomplished due to the lack of a valid screening instrument.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Screening for depression is recommended for all primary care patients. Deaf persons who use American Sign Language as their main mode of communications are at risk for depression and cannot be screened with existing screeners. This proposal will develop a computerized, self-administered Deaf Depression Screener in American Sign Language that is culturally and linguistically specific and deaf user friendly.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Modeling Professional Attitudes and Teaching Humanistic Communication in VR (MPathic-VR)  Patients with life-threatening cancer need caregivers who can help them through difficult decisions by  understanding their interests, values, and beliefs, and who communicate empathically with the patient&#039;s family  and friends, and effectively with their medical peers. Yet medical students, residents, and even oncology  fellows lack effective training in such crucial communications. Educators face great difficulty imparting ethical  and professional values to medical students in traditional   chalk and talk   teaching environments. Standardized  patient instructors (SPIs) have also been used to evaluate professional competencies, but they can be time-  consuming, costly, and perform inconsistently over multiple student encounters. Finally, medical students  themselves are generally resistant to educational measures designed to promote ethical practice and reflective  professionalismas they lack experience to realize why explicit professional education matters.  In Phase I, MCI successfully developed and tested MPathic-VR, a prototype virtual patient educational system  designed to address weaknesses in the current medical educationalparadigm. In this Phase II project, MCI  proposes to greatly enhance the educational breadth and technical sophistication of the Phase I system. At the  completion of Phase II, this platform will feature a rich and coherent educational experience relevantto  communication in the setting of cancer, and will be tested for effectiveness in a mixed-methods trial in the  curriculum of two medical schools.  The project has five aims. (1) Expand the Phase I   Breaking Bad News   design into a more comprehensivetraining experience that addresses additional Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME)  core competencies. (2) Develop a character animation-authoring framework to enable the rapid creation of highly  expressive virtual human characters. (3) Develop capability to capture learners&#039; nonverbal behavior to create a  natural, human-like (i.e., bi-directional and multi-modal) interaction between VHs and learners. (4) Implement  automated methods to bookmark   teachable moments   occurring ineach learner-VH interaction, and provide  learners with summative feedback on their effective/ineffective communications. (5) Demonstrate the  effectiveness of the MPathic-VR educational program in a two-armed, mixed-methods trial with a control and an  intervention arm at each of two medical schools.  In summary, the MPathic-VR program will place lessons about professionalism, empathy, teamwork and  patient-centeredness into a context that is both highly engaging and pedagogically solid. The Phase II project  will rigorously evaluate the extent to which software program can enhance medical school curricula in the  above competencies, and in verbal and non-verbal communication skills. At the end of Phase II, MCW will  have created a ground-breaking softwareprogram that can be used to teach medical students the ACGME  competencies that all physicians should demonstrate when caring for a patient with terminal illness.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Modeling Professional Attitudes and Teaching Humanistic Communication in VR (MPathic-VR)  Doctors rarely receive effective training on how to communicate with patients who have terminal cancer, to help  them with difficult decisions that have great emotional and financial impacts on the patients and on society. Toaddress this communication failure, Medical Cyberworlds will build on its very successful Phase I   Breaking Bad  News   prototype and develop a revolutionary training platform-with highly expressive virtual patients and other  virtual human characters-that will help medical students to develop the insight, skill and competency to handle  crucial medical conversations in ways that are patient-centered, caring and competent. Phase II innovations  include: (1) a program with rigorous teaching methods to givelearners specific, individualized, precise,  reproducible, and unbiased feedback, unlike human evaluators; (2) development of tools and techniques to  automate normally time- and cost-intensive processes of creating high quality virtual humans; (3) bi-directional  operation with software that capture both the learners&#039; selected verbal responses and-through webcam or  Kinect-aspects of learners&#039; non-verbal communication; and (4) automated learner assessment and review.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Substantial evidence gathered over the last 50 years shows that non-adherence to treatment poses a crucial barrier to effective care and survival for cancer and other chronic diseases. At least one in five cancer patients do not adhere to treatment regimen, with much higher disease-specific rates. This non-adherence, or deviation from the recommended and expected clinical path, can dramatically increase costs of care, hospitalizations, adverse outcomes and the chance ofpreventable death. What causes non-adherence to treatment regimens is currently not rigorously understood. Current adherence research methods largely rely on survey instruments that have limited scale and scope, provide lagging information that inhibits timely intervention, and offer little actionable information to help patients to adhere to their care regimens. With continuous changes in cancer treatment, newer proactive approaches and methods for surveillance of patient adherence and targeted interventions are needed. In this Phase 2 SBIR project we will examine the validity of a novel approach (based on the completed Phase-1 project) that uses a novel computational algorithm to glean fine- grained attributes of cancer patients from standard electronic medical records. Our preliminary work has shown that most electronic medical records contain free-form text describing patient health progress, sentiment, vitals, medical condition, side effects, and social history written by physicians, nurses, medical assistants, and other staff during every visit encounter. With the steady adoption of electronic medical records by clinicians across the US (currently 29% and rising at 12% per year), clinical notes found in electronic records offer a tantalizing source of insight into patient adherence and behavior. In this Phase-2 SBIR project we aim to commercialize a novel, scalable prototype that can glean a rich set of risk factors for patient non-adherence from 1.5 million patient encounter records, corresponding to 30,050 patients that span a 10 year time-horizon from a community cancer clinic. Our objectives are to estimate the risk of a patient&#039;s ability to adhere to a prescribed regimen and enable targeted and timely interventions by using computational analysis of unstructured and structured fields in standard clinical documentation. We also aim to monitor and measure important patient treatment and adherence metrics (e.g. as defined by the American Society of Clinical Oncology) that can play a significant role in tracking high-risk patients for improved patient treatment outcomes, adherence, quality and safety.  Our approach represents a significant, actionable advance over the lagging indicators offered by survey-based methods prevalent in adherence research. Our proposed approach has deep implications for improved quality of care, proactive management of chronic diseases, retention of patients in clinical practice and clinical trials, patient safety, improved patient follow-up and risk assessment, drug and disease surveillance, enablement of new care models, targeted intervention, and improved outcomes by helping patients to better adhere to their regimens.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We aim to show the feasibility of a commercial early warning system that detects and estimates a cancer patient&#039;s risk of non-adherence to treatment regimens by analyzing unstructured text in standard medical records. This technology has tremendous relevance for improved quality of care, proactive management of chronic diseases and patient safety.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Leukocytes (LE) are major contributors to the pathogenesis and progression of many clinical inflammatory disorders, including the systemic inflammatory response syndrome, sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome.The need for new and innovative therapies to treat these inflammatory disease states presents a large commercial market opportunity. A large number of therapeutic approaches are under investigation to limit the activation and tissue accumulation of LE at sites of inflammation in order to minimize tissue destruction and disease progression. A therapeutic device within an extracorporeal blood circuit, called the selective cytopheretic device (SCD), sequesters activated LE in a low calcium environment and inhibits their release of inflammatory proteins and cytokines. This Phase II research proposal builds on the Phase I goals which successfully demonstrated the 1st generation SCD1G to have greater therapeutic efficacy with increasing surface area (SA) in a large animal model of septic shock, when compared to sham treated controls, in addition to establishing a simplified SCD extracorporeal circuit for ease of use under  standard-of- care hospital settings. This Phase II proposal will determine the design and fabrication of a 2nd Generation SCD2G. Custom SCD2G designs will maintain the low shear force and low ionized calcium environment, shown to be efficacious for SCDG1, with variations to include flow path, flow rates, packing density, and SA, in addition to reduced blood fill volumes which were not achievable with the SCD1G commercially available hollow fiber cartridges. The lower blood fill volume and blood flow rate requirements, will allow SCD2G therapy to be administered via a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC line) or to criticall ill patients with hemodynamic instability. SCD2G designs will be evaluated in silico via computational flow dynamics simulation to assess casing design and internal device geometry. Prototypes will be fabricated and flowvisualization studies performed to determine designs with advantageous flow profiles (Aim 1). In vitro blood circuits with fresh blood will be used to evaluate SCD2G designs selected from in silico studies with respect to hemocompatibility and LE bindingcharacteristics (Aim 2). Lastly, selected SCD2G designs will be evaluated in the porcine model of septic shock used in the Phase I studies. Various renal and cardiovascular parameters, pulmonary inflammation, cytokine levels, systemic neutrophil activationload and time to death will be compared between SCDG2 designs of varying SA and the SCDG1 (Aim 3). SCDG1 therapy has demonstrated an excellent safety profile and compelling efficacy impact in three exploratory clinical trials, reducing mortality rates from the control rate of 60% to 30%, in  ICU patients with acute renal failure requiring continuous renal replacement therapy; 50-60% of these patients were also septic. This proposal will determine a finalized SCD2G design to treat a broad array of patientswith sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock and will provide data for an application to the FDA for IDE approval for the SCD to be used in the treatment of sepsis.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this proposal is to develop a Second Generation Selective Cytopheretic Device (SCD2G), an extracorporeal membrane device that can sequester activated leukocytes and inhibit their inflammatory activity in order to reduce tissue accumulation and resulting damage in patients. Inflammatory diseases such as sepsis and Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) are high impact medical indications, as severe sepsis with SIRS occurs in 200,000 patients annually in the U.S. and has a mortality rate of 30-40%, even with use of intensive care units and broadspectrum antibiotics. The relevance of this proposal to public health is that the SCD would greatly reduce the multiorgan effects of sepsis and SIRS, thus improving the clinical outcome of patients affected by these disease processes.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A causative role of high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) types in human cancer has been established, particularly for those of the anogenital region including cervical and anal cancers. The etiologic course of such cancers is thought to involve HPV infection, persistence of infection, progression to an immediate precursor of cancer, and finally invasion (the latter two steps requiring additional host oncogenic events). Despite the success of cervical cancer screening programs based on the appearance of abnormal cells in cytology specimens and HPV-type, there is a great need to identify additional biomarkers to increase the sensitivity with which precancer/cancer are detected, so providing additional triage of the approximately 2,000,000 women each year in the US who undergo colposcopy for follow-up of abnormal cytology. Gain of 3q and to a lesser extent gain of 5p and 20q, are genomic abnormalities commonly detected in HPV-associated cancers, and as such represent potential biomarkers of HPV-associated cancer progression. In the current application, Cancer Genetics, Inc. proposes to develop and validate a fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)-based HPV- associated cancer detection test (FHACT) to detect the three genomic abnormalities in cervical and anal cytology specimens. Phase I; Specific Aim 1: Confirmation of gain of 3q, 5p, and 20q in cervical precancerous and cancer cytology specimens. 200 cervical cytology specimens will be submitted to four- color FISH using probes to detect gain of 3q (red), 5p (green), and 20q (gold), to confirm association with cytologic severity and to provide an initial estimate of the sensitivity for precancer/cancer detection. If the sensitivity is comparable to that for cytology alone, then Phase II will be initiated. Phase II; Specific Aim 1: Validation of automated scanning for the FHACT in cervical cytology specimens. The scanning/scoring procedure for the FHACT will be automated in order to adapt the assay for increased output. PhaseII; Specific Aim 2: Optimization of the FHACT in 1,000 cervical cytology specimens. The sensitivity and specificity of the FHACT will be determined for the entire dataset of 1,000 cervical cytology specimens and compared with that by cytology alone, afteroptimization of cut-offs, probe combinations, and numbers of nuclei to score. Phase II; Specific Aim 3: Optimization of the FHACT in 1,000 anal cytology specimens. Comparable studies to those above will be performed for anal cytology specimens, where standard-of-care screening programs have as yet to be developed for at-risk populations. Specimens will be obtained from Drs. Castle and Wentzensen, at the National Cancer Institute who are leading studies aimed at improving cancer prevention screening programsand identifying biomarkers of HPV-associated cancers. The overall goal of the project then is to develop and validate a robust, sensitive, and specific FISH-based test that together with standard cytology and HPV-typing will significantly contribute to more accurate detection of precancer/cancer, impacting standard-of-care recommendations in HPV-associated cancer screening programs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Despite the success of cervical cancer prevention screening programs, there are many women in the US, who annually undergo medical procedures based on an abnormal Pap test and oncogenic virus test, which are later found to be unnecessary and costly, due to the lack of the sensitivity of these tests. Thus, in the current proposal a genetic-based precancerand cancer detection test is to be developed and validated, that uses residual Pap or anal test material. Implementation of this test into cervical and anal cancer prevention screening programs should provide an additional triage to identify those patients who require medical follow-up versus who do not, thereby reducing the performance of unnecessary and costly medical procedures, ultimately impacting population coverage of such programs in low resource countries.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a proposal to conduct a multi-center, double-blind, sham-controlled partial cross-over interventional study to test safety and efficacy of our novel tinnitus therapy. The tinnitus field generally accepts that elevated synchronous spontaneous activity in the auditory cortex may account for the tinnitus percept that arises following hearing loss. Following hearing loss that leads to tinnitus, some neurons in the auditory cortex start responding to adjacent frequencies and therefore, a population of neurons becomes over stimulated and starts firing spontaneously and synchronously. This pathological activity is thought to give rise to the tinnitus sensation. Based on these considerations, we developed an approach to reduce the tinnitus percept by redistributing the frequencies along the auditory tonotopic axis, thus reducing the responsiveness of neurons that had too much input. Our therapy pairs selected tone presentations with simultaneous stimulation of the vagus nerve to induce a redistribution of the distorted auditory cortical frequency map observed in tinnitus. Based on our SBIR Phase I results, this approach seemed to alleviate the presumed behavioral and neurophysiological correlates of tinnitus in a rat modelof the disease. In our SBIR Phase II studies, we further evaluated and validated the stimulation conditions for reducing the tinnitus precept in our chosen animal model. Based on these positive findings in animals, we evaluated our approach as a therapy for tinnitus in seven humans in a clinical Phase I study in Europe. The preliminary results of that small study suggest that our therapy is safe and can be highly effective in some people. Based on this successful clinical Phase I study, we are seeking to more fully evaluate our therapy in a larger cohort (30 people) using an SBIR Phase II competing renewal award (SBIR Phase IIb). Criteria for Success: We must reduce the magnitude the tinnitus as measured by the minimum masking level. To our knowledge, no masking or pharmacological treatment for tinnitus has reliably reduced this measure. Based on our preliminary findings in humans, we expect that our treatment will reduce the primary measure by 7 dB or more in at least 50% of subjects and the reductions willlast for months. A clinically significant MML change is any value greater than 5 dB. Numerous standard subjective measures of tinnitus are also expected to show a reduction or trend toward reduction. No serious adverse events that can be attributed to ourtherapy should be observed. A successful trial will lead to a clinical Phase III double-blind efficacy study and mechanistic studies. If the  Phase III trial is successful, we expect to deploy a commercial device immediately following FDA approval.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Tinnitus is a sensation of a constant ringing in the ears in the absence of external sound. Tinnitus is a debilitating medical condition for millions of Americans. There are no proven treatments for this condition. This is a proposal to develop the first effectiv treatment for alleviating people of this debilitating condition.",

Compared to conventional surface electrodes, this system will provide:  7 more channels for prosthesis control from a larger number of muscles in the residual limb,  7 improved specificity and repeatability for recording from individual muscles and muscle groups,  7 higher reliability and quality for the recorded signals under different socket conditions,  7 selective, consistent signals from deep muscles, especially in targeted reinnervation users, and  7 the ability to use gel, vacuum, and other prosthesis socket lining systems that do not easily accommodate  surface electrodes. These multichannel recordings will also enable users to generate simultaneous multi-axis movementswith a more natural feel of control than existing myocontrollers that only actuate a single joint axis at a time. In Phase I, we will conduct a proof-of-concept animal study to validate the electrode and electronics design. We will compare the wireless multichannel EMG signals transmitted by an implanted prototype system to a standard percutaneous EMG wired system in canines during treadmill walking.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall aim of this proposal is the acquisition of the remaining pre-clinical data required for submission of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application for a human clinical trial of XT-101 for the treatment of neuropathic pain. XT-101 is an encapsulated formulation of an expression plasmid DNA encoding human interleukin-10 (IL-10). There is a tremendous unmet clinical need for safe and effective treatment for neuropathic pain. The failure of current therapeuticsto treat neuropathic pain effectively may reflect the fact that all of these agents explicitly target neurons. Over the last two decades, there has been a growing understanding of the importance of glial activation in the development and persistence of neuropathic pain, with exponentially increasing numbers of publications across years documenting the critical importance of glial dysregulation in animal models pathological pain, including neuropathic pain. Critical to the rationale for XT-101 is the fact that it is now solidly documented across animal models that glial dysregulation of pain is created and maintained by the perseverant release of glial pro-inflammatory products in spinal cord. The most important of these spinal glial pro-inflammatory products, for pathological pain in general and for neuropathic pain in particular, are pro- inflammatory cytokines. XT-101, by inducing prolonged production and release of the powerful anti- inflammatory cytokine, IL-10, targets the activated glial cells and glialproinflammatory products that are responsible for supporting and amplifying neuropathic pain signals. XT-101 has been shown to be highly efficacious in the leading animal models for neuropathic pain. The specific aims for this project are to 1) Develop and implement good manufacturing practice (GMP) process for production of XT-101, 2) Complete all remaining pre-clinical studies necessary to support the filing of an IND with the FDA, and 3) Prepare and file an IND with the FDA for XT-101 in a neuropathic pain indication. To achieve these aims, the project proposes a series of studies, including standard toxicology studies that will demonstrate the safety of XT-101 in appropriate animal models and provide information to guide human dosing. Based on our pre-IND meeting with the FDA, we expect that the data obtained from the successful completion of these studies, along with the substantial existing data supporting the safety and efficacy of XT- 101, will be sufficient to support the filing of an IND with the FDA.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cerebral ischemia is a major cause of death and long-term disability, with high accompanying social and medical costs. Approximately 795,000 Americans suffer a stroke each year at an estimated annual cost of  73.7B (American Heart Association. Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics, 2010 Update). Substantial preclinical data support the use of NMDA receptor antagonists to reduce brain damage caused by cerebral ischemia. However, to date no drug acting through this target has been successful in clinical trials of cerebral ischemia, largely due to two issues: i) adverse effects that prevented attaining drug levels adequate for efficacy, and ii) clinical restraints that prevented drug administration within the short time afterischemia required for efficacy. We are using a multi-pronged strategy to overcome these obstacles in the development of a context-dependent, pH-sensitive, NR2B subunit selective NMDA receptor antagonist for prophylactic use in subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). SAH patients are at substantial risk of experiencing a stroke-like ischemic event four to 14 days after their surgery to coil or clip their aneurysm. NR2B selective antagonists are intrinsically better tolerated than early generations of non-selective NMDA antagonists. Furthermore, our medicinal chemistry and pharmacology group has discovered and optimized compounds selective for NR2B receptor inhibition that are more potent at the interstitial acidic pH characteristic of the penumbral region in focal ischemia than non-ischemic tissue. More importantly, the relative lack of NMDA receptor block in non- ischemic, healthy tissues at physiological pH minimizes the potential for on-target cognitive and psychotomimetic adverse effects that have limited prior drug candidates. Because of the context-dependent, penumbral-selective actions of our compounds, we anticipate a dramatic improvement in drug tolerability, allowing for prophylactic administration prior to ischemia during the 14 days after aneurysm surgery inSAH patients. Thus, our IND candidate will be available for neuroprotective NMDA receptor block at the site of, and earliest onset of, secondary ischemia. The work proposed here is aimed at identifying a novel neuroprotective agent suitable for prophylactic use by taking advantage of coupling pH-dependent receptor block with the intrinsic efficacy and tolerability of NR2B-selective NMDA receptor blockade.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer&#039;s disease (AD) is the most common form of senile dementia. An estimated 5.3 million Americans are affected, and this number is increasing yearly. Currently, there is no cure for AD; however, it is widely accepted that inhibiting amyloid plaque formation would be beneficial for the prevention of Alzheimer&#039;s disease. Although there are many approaches for the treatment of AD, one novel and innovative approach is to modulate the activity of the key enzyme complexinvolved in Abeta42 production (a primary component of amyloid plaques), gamma-secretase. Because of the potential for serious side-effects associated with inhibition of gamma-secretase, modulation of its activity was targeted in order to avoid non-specific effects on other gamma-secretase substrates such as the Notch, an essential element for normal cellular development. Our scientific approach utilized a cell-based assay that led to the discovery of a proprietary series of gamma-secretase modulators. Medicinal chemistry followed by in vitro and in vivo optimization efforts led to the identification of the lead compound NGP 328, a small molecule that has been demonstrated to lower Abeta42 both in vitro and in vivo and which promotes the formation of smaller, potentially less toxic Abeta peptides (Abeta37 and Abeta38) without altering the activity of gamma-secretase toward other substrates such as Notch. We propose to do an initial proof of concept study in a non-transgenic rodent in which initial toxicity and safety studies will be conducted. We plan to compare the effects of orally delivered NGP 555 on specific Abeta biomarkers in rat CSF to any Notch-related toxicity to determine a therapeutic window. Additionally, we will identify an appropriate oral or solid delivery system for future toxicity and safety studies. If these studies are successful, we plan to initiate full-fledged pre- clinical development of NGP 555 for the prevention of Alzheimer&#039;s disease. In this proposal we plan to identify a therapeuticwindow for modulating Abeta peptides in rodent CSF to Notch-related histological toxicity (proof of concept study) and to complete pre-clinical development of NGP 555 including the following: 1) Prepare a batch of non-GMP NGP 555 drug substance to supportnonclinical studies. 2) Conduct IND-enabling beagle dog cardiopulmonary safety, acute toxicity, and 14-day toxicity studies. 3) Conduct in vivo NGP 555 genotoxicity, drug elimination and tissue distribution studies and conduct drug-drug interaction studies in vitro. These studies are expected to result in filing an Investigational New Drug (IND) application for NGP 555.",

Each year 795,000 Americans have a stroke and the annual costs to the economy are  57.9 billion. The vast majority of acute ischemic strokes are caused by a thrombus (blood clot) which occludes the blood vessel and stops blood flow to the brain. Tissue plasminogen activator (TPA), an agent that catalyzes the dissolution of blood clots, is the only effective, FDA-approved treatment for ischemic stroke. Unfortunately, TPA is associated with significant risks, delays in treatment, and is unsuccessful in up to 70% of patients at dissolving blood clots in sufficient time to protect the brain. There is a need for a safer, more effective therapy that facilitates early treatment, saves lives, reduces disability and lowers health care costs. In pre-clinical studies, we have shown that these goals might be achieved by a molecule that inactivates the major inhibitor of plasmin and, dissolves clots through a unique mechanism that avoids the risk of hemorrhage and neurotoxicity associated with TPA therapy. Following FDA guidance, we converted this molecule into a biologic drug candidate for stroke (stromab) that potently accelerates the dissolution of human clots. The goal of this Fast Track application is to move stromab further towards human trials by following FDA guidance to: 1) determine the optimal formulation and therapeutic time window for treatment, 2) produce and purify stromab under GLP conditions, 3) investigate the safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of stromab and, 4) submit an IND to the FDA.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Goal: The long term goal is determine whether pentylenetetrazole (PTZ), a previously approved drug with over 30 years of human use, can be a safe and efficacious therapy for patients with DS. The specific goal of the proposed program is to conduct the translational work required to submit an IND with FDA to initiate human clinical studies. Significance: DS is the most common form of DID with a US prevalence of over 350,000 people and incidence of about 1 in 700 births. Currently there are no drugs approved to treat the cognitive impairment in DS and address the huge unmet medical need in this population. It was widely believed that as a congenital condition with multiple trisomic genes, DS was too complex to address through drug therapy. Successful demonstration that PTZ is efficacious in human clinical trials could: 7  Lead to great improvements in the quality of life and productivity of patients with DS. 7  Boost interest in other pharmacological approaches to address DSand other DIDs, which may  share a common underlying basis for cognitive disability. 7  Define a development and regulatory path in DS and DIDs that should dramatically reduce future  development risk and stimulate significant pharmaceutical RandD investment in the field. Hypothesis: Recent research in a mouse model of DS (Ts65Dn) suggests that a restoration of imbalance between NMDA-mediated excitation and GABAA receptor mediated inhibition through administration of PTZ, a GABAA receptor antagonist results in improved memory and learning [1, 2]. It is hypothesized that over-inhibition also occurs in the brains of patients with DS, and that therapeutic intervention with PTZ can also address the cognitive impairment in this population. Phase 1 Specific Aims:Aim 1): Determine safe and efficacious doses for PTZ in Ts65Dn mice with a focus on seizure risk assessment. Aim 2) Successfully synthesize 1kg scale of drug substance for IND-enabling toxicology studies. Aim 3) Complete preclinical studies needed to support a productive pre-IND meeting with FDA. Aim 4) Create clinical trial synopses and propose clinical approval strategy for pre-IND meeting. Aim 5) Submit pre-IND briefing book and conduct pre-IND meeting with FDA Phase 2 Specific Aims: Aim 1) Develop a suitable clinical formulation and manufacture drug product. Aim 2) Complete safety pharmacology and 28 day toxicology to support IND submission. Aim 3) Complete toxicokinetic, pharmacokinetic, and metabolism studies. Aim 4) Write clinical protocol for firsthuman clinical trial. Aim 5) Prepare and file IND with FDA to allow initiation of clinical trials. Aim 6) Complete 6 and 9 month rat and dog toxicology studies to support Ph 2 trials. 1",

        "abstract": "The Urban Forestry Modeling and Prioritization Tools project addresses the research and tasks necessary for creating cost effective, web-based software that assists urban foresters with strategically selecting planting locations in order to maximize impact on both the environment and local communities. Studies by the US Forest Service and other groups demonstrate the many environmental, health, aesthetic, and economic benefits of a large urban forest canopy. With limited resources to devote to planting and maintaining trees, however, urban foresters, community groups, and other organizations struggle with prioritizing planting locations in order to achieve the greatest economic and ecological return on investment. The difficulty in selecting a planting location is compounded by increasingly limited resources and the different needs and concerns of various communities. The Urban Forestry Modeling and Prioritization Tools were designed to provide assistance in determining effective tree planting locations based on a group&#039;s individual needs and priorities. The prototype software application consists of two components - one for the prioritization of tree planting locations and one for future scenario modeling. On the prioritization page, users can more easily identify ideal tree planting locations based on factors such as flood plain location and air quality. Users are able to adjust each factor and, within a second or less, view a personalized heat map identifying key tree planting locations based on the selected criteria. By switching to the scenario modeling page, users can identify an area of interest on the map and select the number, species, and size of trees to plant in that area. The modeling software prototype then applies growth and tree mortality rates to calculate the survival rate of the trees over a thirty year time period. Users can display the financial and ecosystem benefits generated by the trees over several decades to inform their decision-making. The target audiences for the Urban Forest Modeling and Prioritization Tools are municipal governments, regional planning commissions, non-profit organizations including horticultural and urban greening groups, community and neighborhood associations, stormwater and watershed managers, universities, and large parcel owners. Each of these groups could use the web-based tools to more accurately plan tree planting projects and improve the health of the urban forest. The speed and flexibility of the software as well as its usability by non-technical individuals open new possibilities for integrating heat mapping and geographic analysis into web-based modeling activities. Since a large urban forest and urban tree canopy has proven environmental, aesthetic, economic, and health benefits, the entire community benefits from more strategic tree planting.",

The Forest Service must play a significant role in the development of new markets and ensure their integrity.&quot; Small-diameter round timber is a vast and under-used waste product of well-managed forests. At the same time, the structural building systems market is currently dominated by steel and concrete structural systems. Round timber can substitute for steel and concrete in medium and large scale construction under Type IV: &quot;Heavy Timber Framing.&quot; Round timber can qualify for up to eight US Green Building Council Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) credits, more than triple any other &quot;green&quot; structural material and almost a third of the credits necessary to achieve LEED Silver rating, now the standard for new federal buildings. This convergence of factors will benefit WT&#039;s efforts to build an industry. Research conducted at the FPL indicates the superior strength of round wood timbers. Small-diameter round timbers are 50% stronger in bending than an equivalent square section of milled timber. WHOLETREES ARCHITECTURE AND STRUCTURES (WT), a leader in round timber design and construction, has conducted Phase I research into the strength of the branched connection between tree limbs and trunk. Structural tests, conducted at the Forest Products Laboratory in Madison, WI, applied lateral or axial force to a variety of branching Ash tree specimens and found the strength of the branched connection to be significant. Phase I testing demonstrated that out-of-plane bending of tributary branches or stem is critical to overall timber load capacity. Optical metrics of branched timbers along with structural analysis can be effective predictors of load capacities. A combination of slenderness ratio, branched geometry, and out-of-plane curvature seem to be a strong estimator of the load capacities. WT will, in Phase II, conduct focused testing to refine the selection criteria for specimens - a combination of slenderness ratio, branched angle and out-of-plane curvature - and develop the best visual parameters for selection. These selection criteria will be used for in-field sorting, and to develop proprietary grading software. Designing and testing original connection subassemblies will be crucial to bringing the strength of the branched timber to market. WT will build successful connection designs into full-scale branched column-truss assemblies.",

        "abstract": "Regions in the US with wind levels suitable for producing substantial renewable energy are located in the predominantly agricultural center of the country where population density and therefore demand for electrical power are low. Transport of power from wind farms in this section of the country to the coastal regions where population and the need for power are high is limited by the capacity of the electrical grid, which was designed to link power sources (mainly coal and nuclear plants) located close to demand centers. Television and radio broadcasters are heavy consumers of electrical power with transmission facilities distributed across all regions of the US. Most regions are served by broadcasters with transmitters on or adjacent to farmland. In many cases, the placement of 1 turbine on each of these farms would generate enough power for both the farmer and the broadcaster without adding to the load on the utility grid. TV and FM broadcasters spend more than $400MM annually on transmitter power. A distributed wind cooperative among broadcasters and farmers will bring many benefits to rural economies and to the environment. It will improve the sustainability of local television in rural communities by making a direct substantial reduction to their electrical bill, which is their largest non-personnel expense Benefits to the agriculture industry include a new, reliable, on-site cash generating &quot;wind energy crop&quot; that can be sold locally. The project will enable substantial amounts of money spent for energy to remain in local, rural communities. It will also help to provide a steady income for farmers which could prevent the sale or repossession of the &quot;family farm&quot; due to financial hardship. These distributed, local community-based, renewable power systems have been prevalent in Europe for decades. Distributed wind energy systems circumvent the national power grid constraints by utilizing the power directly, on site. There are approximately 1,200 TV and 2,600 FM transmitters in the 12 windswept Midwest states and another 14,000 transmitters in the remaining states. If fully realized, distributed wind turbines serving all TV and FM markets have the potential to produce approximately 4 TW hours of renewable energy and eliminate 2.5 million metric tons of CO2 annually. It has been well established that wind turbines can cause interference to TV and Radio transmissions. Phases 1 of this project developed a proof of feasibility basic interference model. Phase II will develop an general interference prediction model that can be used to properly place turbines on farms in close proximity to transmission towers while eliminating or mitigating problems with signal interference. Phase 3 will demonstrate the full technical and economic performance of an operating transmitter powered by and co-sited with a fully operational wind turbine.",

We forecast production for each commodity and each country using auto regressive techniques of time &amp; #8208;series data. The data are manipulated by the user, and results are visualized simultaneously in graph form, caterpillar charts and on a three dimensional interactive map of the 186 countries in the database. All data are live and animated as users explore historical and future trends and relationships. The queries are downloadable to Excel for further analysis or exportable as a PowerPoint for slide presentations. For a view of the prototype go to: www.globalfoodin3d.com.

Beta testing and focus groups reveal that though we are on the right track, and users are wowed by the power and elegance of Global Feed in 3Dtm, they are still reluctant to switch their work routines. Commercial success requires that users see our software as a relevant substitute for their current analytical routines. Thus Global Feed in 3Dtm needs to be structured in a way that is consistent with how users work.

        "abstract": "There are several barriers preventing mechanization of tasks that require detailed interactions, such as pruning and picking, with specialty crops. While each application requires unique solutions, this project addresses the critical system level issue of how to move a robot arm around and through complex plants and perform specific tasks in a dynamic environment. Real plants are all unique with constantly changing branches, foliage and fruit. The economic viability of mechanization requires very fast action, but it is difficult to delicately maneuver a robot arm (mounted on a platform moving down the row) through such complex plants. For several years, Vision Robotics has been developing systems that use stereo cameras to model plants. Using this technology, robots can now &quot;understand&quot; the plants well enough to perform the various tasks. However, existing commercial and research systems that control arm motions are either significantly too slow or expensive for economically viable systems. The objective of this project is to overcome these deficiencies by building on Phase 1 results by researching and developing the key systems to improve the control of arm motions. Dynamically reacting to changes and errors requires closed-loop control of the robotic arm, which has been successfully implemented for many non-agricultural applications (e.g., spot-welding) and even some agricultural applications (e.g., hedge-pruning) that only require coarse and/or slow control of an actuator. Unfortunately, existing closed-loop systems are not suitable for high-speed and detailed operations on complex objects such as those required for pruning and picking. Research and development efforts in Phase II will focus on building on an existing stereo vision based arm controller currently deployed on the company&#039;s grapevine pruner prototype by developing robust, computationally fast and accurate methods of calculating the difference between the current and desired position and orientation of robot arms and using that feedback to control commercially available off-the-shelf robot arms. Coupling Vision Robotics&#039; existing plant modeling technology with the high speed and accurate, yet low cost, arm control systems developed during this project will create a viable system for working on specialty crops. In particular, the grapevine pruner upon which the control system will be demonstrated, will ultimately prune as well as manual labor at an equal or lower cost. Currently, manual pruning costs US growers approximately $700M per year and the availability of manual labor presents a potential crisis. Once fully implemented, this intelligent mechanization gives growers a third option when deciding whether to use a shrinking and more expensive labor pool or lower quality mechanization.",

        "abstract": "Grain production, storage, and processing are important industries. The LGB is a primary pest of cereal grains in the US and other parts of the world. It has been estimated that 5-10% of stored grain in developed countries and 35% of stored grain in developing countries is lost to insect damage. Estimates of the cost of grain loss due to insect, mold, and mycotoxin damage to the 15 billion bushels of grain stored in the United States each year have ranged from $500 million to in excess of $1 billion. Flour millers have a low tolerance for live insects and the presence of live insects or signs of insect feeding can result in rejection of grain. Rejection produces additional expenses associated with fumigation and transportation, and can be as much as 10-20% of the value of the grain. There is a general trend toward no tolerance for live insects and domestic flour mill contracts specify an upper rejection limit. If a load is rejected at the processor, the cost to the supplier can be as much as 10-20% of the total value of the commodity. The purpose here is to reduce these losses.",

        "abstract": "The SSTH directly responds to a need that was declared by Wyoming ranchers in more than 300 surveys collected during Wyoming agriculture tradeshows between 2007 and 2011. Nationwide, the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) weather maps indicate that 29 entire states plus portions of 7 more endure freezing temperatures for at least 4 months annually. In this combined area, an estimated 663,000 agricultural producers raise beef cattle, sheep and bison, which represent 43% of the nation&#039;s livestock producers. The 2007 USDA Census of Agriculture reports beef production costs increased 30% overall between 2002 and 2007, with feed purchases showing the highest increase, up 45%. The SSTH will help improve ranching economics by cutting costs as well as opening the door to the growing market for higher-priced organic, natural and grass-fed markets. SSTH solves the problem of stock water tank freeze-over without recurring costs of fuel and grid-provided electricity. This enables longer pasture grazing which reduces the need to purchase and transport expensive harvested forages, facilitates better pasture utilization and grazing management, reduces the need for feed-lot utilization, and the time and cost to relocate animals. Pasture-raising livestock year-around also mitigates environmental problems caused by large numbers of animals in a confined space, such as high concentrations of manure that becomes a pollutant, and byproducts such as organic matter, urea, ammonia, nitrous oxide, phosphorus, carbon dioxide, pathogens, antibiotics and hormones that are released directly into the ground and air, degrading ground and surface waters and soil, and posing health hazards to humans and animals. SSTH will provide a sustainable solution to winter time tank freezing. The most common method of de-icing stock tanks is electric tank heaters, but for remote pastures without electricity this is not an option, and the few commercially available solutions have temperature, animal volume, or cost limitations: (1) Solar and wind powered aerators are ineffective below +10 degrees F., (2) Solar and geothermal &quot;drinkers&quot; service few animal at a time, per drinking station, (3) Propane-fired heaters have ongoing costs ranging from $1.87 to $3.97 per gallon, and (4) Wind and solar electricity generating equipment adapted for water heating has high up-front cost, in the range of $14,000 to $22,000, plus installation. According to the Wyoming surveys, non-commercial methods commonly employed to keep livestock water open are (1) 38% manually break ice with an ax or steel bar, (2) 26% run water continuously so the ground water melts through the ice layer (often employed with solar and wind-powered pumps), even though this practice wastes water and forms dangerous ice around the tank base, (3) 5% abandon pastures and relocate herds where water can be kept open, often in corrals or feed lots, as well as home-devised remedies that use combinations of insulation, geothermal sources, various methods of agitation and wood fires.",

Reliable sensors that accurately measure these parameters will contribute to a healthy environment for animal growth and for workers, while saving the energy and cost of over-ventilation. Current systems are of two types: state-of-the-art instruments for field use are precise and accurate, but are limited by their cost and size, and their demands on power and labor. The second category consists of cost-effective test kits and point sensors that perform single measurements with acceptable accuracy and sensitivity, but they are ineffective in livestock operations, which limit their use in agriculture applications. It is extremely important to have continuous, reliable, and autonomous monitoring of breathable air supply in livestock environments. Systems must enable better control of ventilation rates, ensuring adherence to regulatory contaminant limits.

Multiform produces the struvite by extracting it from wastewaters containing excess phosphorus. Multiform sells into two markets: 1) wastewater generators who need to reduce the phosphorus content of the wastewater; and 2) consumers of the nutrients provided by the struvite produced at the wastewater generator sites. The SBIR project focuses on the second market (nutrient consumers). This project, of which the phase I is complete, seeks to further improve the economics of the struvite extraction technology, thus accelerating its adoption, by developing means to convert the crude struvite produced by the extraction process to a higher-value, specialized product. The activities planned for phase II of the project aim to work out continuous, commercially useful processes and apparatuses to produce the high-value products (pellets and formed products such as spikes and tablets) for which the first phase provided product specifications and laboratory-scale, batch type means of producing. Specifically, the technical objectives are (1) Verify market information achieved through Phase I research for five targeted products through direct consultation with buyers. Present upgraded struvite products to buyers and verify that they are ready for commercial sale at a known value; (2) Confirm that struvite products meet buyer nutritional and performance specifications through greenhouse growing trial; (3) Identify potential processes for commercial-scale continuous drying and forming, and identify the necessary struvite conditions and formulas; (4) Develop and monitor continuous manufacturing processes for pelletizing and forming products at laboratory scale; (5) Design and build prototype a manufacturing system capable of drying and forming struvite into one or more target products; and (6) Determine capital and production costs for full operating system, and compare with market data for profit estimate for one or more systems.",

        "abstract": "Salmonellae continue to be one of the leading worldwide causes of foodborne bacterial diseases. They cause 1.2-1.4 million annual cases of salmonellosis in the USA, with associated costs estimated to be as high as $12.8 billion/year (in 1998 dollars). Despite continued and escalating efforts to curb diseases caused by foodborne bacterial pathogens, salmonellae continue to produce foodborne illness at an alarming and increasing rate. In this context, although the overall incidence of foodborne diseases has been declining in the United States, the 2010 report from the FoodNet indicated that the incidence of laboratory-confirmed Salmonella infections continued to increase by approximately 3%, causing 1.2 million U.S. illnesses in that year and being the most common cause of hospitalization and death tracked by the FoodNet. In fact, the incidence of Salmonella-elicited disease during 2010 was nearly 3-fold more than the 2010 national health objective target, and current outbreaks of salmonellosis continue to occur on a regular basis. Moreover, in a disturbing recent development, a Salmonella Typhimurium strain isolated from contaminated ground beef (which was implicated in a multistate outbreak during the fall of 2011) was found to be resistant to several commonly prescribed antibiotics. This is an alarming development because disease caused by such multidrug-resistant strains is associated with an increase in the risk of hospitalization or possible treatment failure in infected individuals. This finding, together with the continuing increase in the incidence of salmonellosis in the United States despite current efforts to curtail that disease, underscores the importance of developing novel intervention strategies and products capable of eliminating or significantly reducing Salmonella in various foods without promoting the emergence of antibiotic-resistant mutants. Any such products should be effective, cheap, safe, environmentally friendly, and easy to use - and there would also be potential advantages for products that target specific Salmonella serotypes; e.g., serotypes predominantly associated with human illness. We believe that a bacteriophage-based preparation/approach may be one such modality. With the partial support from the NIFA USDA Phase I grant, we developed a bacteriophage-based preparation (designated &quot;SalmoFresh&quot;) lytic for Salmonella. During our preliminary studies, we found that SalmoFresh consistently and significantly reduced Salmonella levels in various poultry products by as much as 98%. The goals of our currently proposed Phase II project are to (i) obtain additional data concerning the efficacy of SalmoFresh treatment of various foods that are at high risk of Salmonella contamination, and (ii) obtain pertinent regulatory approvals that will enable us to make SalmoFresh available to the food industry and, thus, help to reduce foodborne contamination with Salmonella. We believe that SalmoFresh has the potential to help significantly reduce Salmonella contamination of various foods (including poultry products) and, therefore, to have a significant impact on improving food safety and public health.",

        "abstract": "Ranked as one of the world&#039;s most valuable commercial seafood, tuna species belonging to the Thunnus genus are considered the most important and endangered fish in worldwide trade. Extensive research to develop methods to distinguish Thunnus at the species level has significantly contributed to the enormous databanks of genetic information on these fish. However to date, no single approach has been successful in completely discriminating all the Thunnus species. Applied Food Technologies (AFT) has been successful in the development of molecular diagnostics for fish species identification. Our two most common approaches include PCR multiplexing utilizing species specific primers and DNA barcoding based on the COI gene sequence alignments. However as others, we have shown that neither approach is specific enough to distinguish these closely related species. A number of other methods based on RFLPs, RAPDs, SSCPs or AFLPs as well as sequencing with numerous different gene targets have also not been successful in distinguishing all species in the Thunnus genus. In Phase I of this project we targeted a different gene sequence to the COI gene that can be utilized to distinguish the six most popular Thunnus species in the fresh form and designed and tested primers that are unique to three of the six species. Success achieved in Phase I feasibility study has positioned AFT, in Phase II, to focus research and development efforts on final optimization of molecular diagnostic methods developed in Phase I and integrate additional commercially important species that are sold under the &quot;tuna&quot; label. Once optimized for fresh/frozen tuna, we will investigate modifications in DNA extraction protocols to enable the use of the diagnostic to identify tuna species in further processed tuna products (canned and in pouches). Our overarching goal is to deliver a commercialized multiplex diagnostic test that will readily distinguish the eight major, high-valued tuna species in commerce from one another as well as from the commonly substituted species found in commerce. The global potential of this research will serve more broadly as a template for the regulatory management of other species with close evolutionary relatedness that are also found subject to fraudulent labeling practice by providing regulators and the industry with a powerful set of tools enabling species identification and authentication. To date, regulators monitoring product labels in commerce and fisheries management groups do not have an available tool to distinguish all Thunnus species. The diagnostic developed as part of this USDA SBIR will be commercially available in our current species identification testing service as well as for use in Federal, State, public and private laboratories. This work also has potential to serve as platform technology in developing DNA-based methods for distinguishing other genetically close related species.",

        "abstract": "Over the past decade, rural school systems have seen a rapid expansion in the number of Hispanic/Latino students who enter school with limited and non-English speaking abilities, and rural schools are being challenged to accommodate this rapid population growth and the education of students with Limited English Proficiency (LEP). There are over 5 million LEP students in the U.S., with more than 300,000 Head Start language learners who enter grade school without the language skills needed for high academic performance. English as a Second Language (ESL) and English Language Learners (ELLs) represent the nation&#039;s fastest growing and most educationally challenged group of students in American schools. From the 1997-98 school year to the 2008-09 school year, the number of English Language Learners enrolled in public schools increased by 51%, from 3.5 million to 5.3 million (NCELA, 2012). The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that within the next 40 years, the Hispanic school-age population will exceed the non-Hispanic white school-age public school population (Fry &amp; Gonzales, 2008). This group of English learners consistently enters school ill-prepared and lag behind their Anglo peers, and the achievement gap remains over the course of their schooling. Babble Tree&#039;s innovative language development program for Pre-Kindergarten and Kindergarten students is intended to transform the way that rural community instructors design and employ English language instructional approaches for ELL students. Phase I results demonstrated significant student achievement gains via Babble Tree&#039;s approach over the use of conventional methods. This Early Language Learning Intervention for Non-English Speaking Latino Children is a research- and game-based, continuous assessment, and student participatory approach that enables limited and non-English speaking language learners to acquire English efficiently, naturally and easily. For rural teachers, who may not have ESL certification or extensive experience in working with Spanish speaking parents, Babble Tree&#039;s program is designed to include a comprehensive set of tools that will support &quot;beginning to advanced&quot; ESL teachers with specific and detailed instructions on how to implement the student-centered, movement-oriented learning and tactile play. The commercial program components will initially include one year of a Pre-K/K (Stage I/II) curriculum and lessons, an instructor&#039;s manual, web-based professional development program, and bilingual parent and home support tools.

        "abstract": "Wind turbines have reshaped rural America by boosting incomes, creating jobs, and harnessing local energy sources. However, conventional tower-mounted wind turbines have three main problems that limit their potential: (1) only about 12 percent of communities have strong enough ground winds to make projects economical; (2) installations are too expensive, requiring a crane and concrete foundation; (3) many communities oppose wind, citing noise or avian impact. This project will develop a breakthrough Airborne Wind Turbine (AWT) to expand the potential low cost wind energy in rural communities. The AWT uses a helium-filled inflatable shell to lift a lightweight turbine 50 to 200 stories high, where winds are up to five times stronger than those reached by a tower. A conductive tether holds the AWT steady and sends power to the ground. The lifting technology is adapted from aerostats: tethered blimps that have been used for decades to reliably lift telecom and surveillance equipment into the air for months at a time. The AWT can expand low cost wind power to hundreds or thousands of new rural communities by tapping stronger high altitude winds, reducing installation time, and lowering community impact. The key research objective of this project is to develop and test a fully-functional AWT prototype that demonstrates its potential for commercial deployment. There are three main technical objectives: (i) design and fabricate a rotor and drive train that integrate composite materials and compact design to significantly lower weight relative to leading tower-mounted turbines, (ii) demonstrate extended, autonomous operations of the AWT prototype in real-world environmental conditions, and (iii) demonstrate a communications and controls systems that allows for remote monitoring and control of the AWT prototype. Following on the Phase I feasibility analysis, Phase II will include a requirements definition, the design and fabrication of a custom lightweight turbine, development of the controls and communications infrastructure for remote operation of the AWT, assembly of a sub-scale inflatable shell, and extended duration autonomous testing in real world conditions. Altaeros anticipates that this technology will demonstrate reliable, high capacity power production beyond the current technology of tower-mounted turbines. The main commercial opportunity is to develop a mid-sized AWT that can expand economical wind power to regions with weak ground-level winds. In addition, the AWT can displace expensive diesel fuel used in off-grid generators used at a variety of sites including remote industrial, island and arctic communities, emergency power, and military bases. In the long term, the AWT will be scaled up to provide a solution to harnesses vast offshore wind resources located over deep water. This research supports USDA goals by enhancing rural prosperity by lowering consumer energy rates, increasing electric system reliability, mitigating climate change, decreasing regional pollution and water shortages, and providing new direct turbine lease payments to rural landowners.",

        "abstract": "Nationwide, Emergency Medical Services (EMS) plays a crucial health care role in the well-being of rural populations. There are substantial challenges within the rural EMS system including: high costs for providing EMS care to sparsely populated regions; fewer tax dollars to fund health programs and trouble with providing public services. In addition, rural regions have difficulties with increasing health care demands from aging residents, poor access to training and medical supervision, volunteer shortages, high response times and lower levels of training. There are many barriers to providing high quality training in rural areas. Rural EMS providers often have to travel long distances to receive training. Conferences, workshops, and specialty trainings tend to happen in urban centers, forcing rural personnel to take time away from their primary jobs and family, not to mention leaving their home community vulnerable in their absence. Widely used in aviation and the military simulation has shown promising results in healthcare. Medical simulation is an emerging training and feedback method in which learners practice tasks and processes in lifelike circumstances, at their own locations, using models or virtual reality, with feedback from observers, peers,and video cameras to assist improvement in skills. But for all its demonstrated potential in improving performance a number of barriers exist to the more widespread dissemination of simulation technology in health care including: 1. cost of simulators and related equipment 2. staff training in simulation technology and methodologies 3. resistance to change in training methods among faculty. It is recognized that the quality of simulation facilitators is one of the most valuable factors for successful simulation training. The primary objective of our Phase 1 project was to research and develop a feasible training approach and tools to make it possible to deliver, manage and measure the effectiveness of advanced medical simulation training for EMS in rural areas. Our results suggest that mobile simulation can be an effective means of improving EMS team and technical skills training in rural agencies. Our goals for our Phase II effort will be to demonstrate a medical simulation training capability that has a positive impact on recruitment and retention of Rural EMS providers and that can be deployed in various operational environments on a commercial scale. Our testbed region for the study will be a 9 county region in Upstate NY. The emphasis during Phase II will be on longer-term impacts. The following additional benefits are anticipated from the Phase II effort:1. Achieve turnover cost savings in rural EMS, 2.Improve patient quality and safety measures in Rural New York, 3.Improve teamwork and communication skills of trainees, 4.Advance the state-of-the-art in health care simulation technology. Mobile simulation training has the potential to decrease the overall cost of providing medical services in remote areas by decreasing the high costs associated with turnover and make scarce health care dollars go further.",

        "abstract": "The now rapidly developing field of plastic materials based on renewable resources (bioplastics) provides tremendous opportunities to sustain and enhance the domestic plastics industries, the fourth largest manufacturing sector of the American economy. In addition, bioplastic materials are derived from agricultural materials and will help reduce the U.S. dependence on foreign oil Growth in the use of these new, greener plastics is proceeding rapidly; however, there are a number of cases in which bioplastics lack the properties needed to compete with increasingly expensive petroleum based materials. Drawing on decades of scientific knowledge about polymer blends and the emerging field of polymer nanocomposites, these property limitations can be overcome. Such technological improvements expand the markets for value-added biobased industrial products. Accordingly, the proposed research directly supports the Sustainable Bioenergy Challenge research priority of the USDA. The goal of this Phase II project is to develop an impact modified bionanocomposite that is 100% based on renewable resources and to use it to produce prototype cutlery. Polylactide (PLA) is a commercially available bioplastic that is biodegradable; however, it is a brittle plastic with poor elongation at break so there is a clear market need for a modifier that improves properties while maintaining biodegradability. To create such a modifier, the key innovation is novel covalent grafting of polymers onto reinforcing cellulosic nanowhiskers (CNW); this creates graft-CNWs (g-CNW). These novel supramolecular structures dramatically improve the impact properties without compromising other desirable properties. In particular, the impact strength will be improved while maintaining modulus and strength. The prototype cutlery will be evaluated for adequate use properties and economic viability.",

        "abstract": "Biomass to biofuels can provide solutions for energy independence, lower cost of fuels and global climate change mitigation. However, to achieve the goal of converting biomass into biofuels, the biomass must be broken down into its component sugars so they can be fermented into fuels. Cellulases are proteins (enzymes) that can breakdown biomass into sugars. Currently these enzymes are not abundant enough or inexpensive enough for widespread use in the biomass industry. Traditional manufacturing methods using microbial production systems are cost prohibitive in part because of the huge upfront capital costs. In contrast, Infinite Enzymes cellulases from recombinant corn seed can lower both upfront capital costs as well as the unit cost of production. Furthermore, the cost of production will continue to decrease as IE scales-up and uses newer corn production lines that yield higher levels of cellulase, driving cost down even more. This project is designed to develop products that will enter early markets for cellulases as purified enzymes and concentrated extracts for the research and pulp-processing markets, respectively. Although the corn-based production system appears lucrative, the potential products have not been characterized from activity, stability, repeatability and scalability standpoints. This Phase II grant is critical to the profitability of the Company in marketing our second phase products,i.e., cellulases for reagent and pulp processing markets. In addition, we are seeking partners for biomass conversion work based on Phase II results.Using plants for production of industrial enzymes capitalizes on tractable and highly scalable agricultural production systems. The plant system offers a new revenue stream to farmers and enables numerous industries because of the potential for low cost and large volumes possible without capital expenditure. The Company focus is plant-powered production of industrial enzymes in seed. Although cellulases are our first product, our plan is to produce many enzymes for large scale biobased industries using this platform technology.",

        "abstract": "There continues to be a need for production of biofuels from agricultural sources. Butanol is a more attractive fuel than ethanol because it leads to better gas mileage, it achieves higher blends with gasoline than bioethanol, it has greater compatibility with existing fuel infrastructure, it is less volatile, it is more amenable to transport via pipeline due to low water absorption, there is no need for an engine retrofit, and it allows to use numerous existing agricultural feedstocks, as well as next generation feedstock including cellulosic biomass and algae. To produce butanol efficiently the fermentation process must be run continuously while maintaining low butanol concentration in the fermenter. This requires that butanol be removed from the fermenter at the same rate that it is produced. This can be done by conventional distillation, which requires that the fermentation broth be first processed for removing the microorganisms for recycle to the fermenter. The clarified broth must be heated and distilled to produce a butanol concentrate in the distillate. The bottoms product from the distillation must be cooled down and recycled to the fermenter. The conventional process requires a solids-liquid separation step and is energy intensive. If an alternate technology were developed to a) Do the butanol recovery without an extra step to do the solids-liquid separation, and b) Reduce the heating/cooling energy requirements of the distillation step It would reduce butanol production costs, save energy and reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. Thus the process for producing biobutanol from agricultural sources and its economical attractiveness would be enhanced. The objective of this program is to develop a membrane system that accomplishes the above at a cost that is at least 30% lower than the cost conventional techniques. The Phase I was extremely successful and produced the data to give high probability of success in this Phase II program. This will be run experimentally and we will use best practices and statistically designed experiments to insure the highest quality data. Anticipated Results: Overall fuel market is 150 billion gallons per year domestically. With USDA/DOE plus executive mandates projecting 30% of fuel being renewable the market potential is 45 billion gallons/yr. Given biobutanol&#039;s superior performance to bioethanol, much of this 45 billion gallons/yr market is available to biobutanol if it can be supplied economically. Potential commercial applications: In addition to butanol, many other valuable chemicals can be derived from agricultural sources, e.g., acetone, glycerol, THF, isoprene, propanediol, gluconic acid, succinic acid, etc. All of these materials, assuming biochemical or fermentation routes to produce these materials are developed, would benefit from the CMS membrane technology and the proposed product concept.",

        "abstract": "Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death among women with more than one million new cases and 370,000 deaths worldwide yearly. Chemotherapy drugs, such as Doxorubicin, have been used in both pre- and post-operative adjuvant therapy or as the main therapeutic option for breast cancer patients with metastatic disease. Although recent advances in the combination of chemotherapy drugs have improved survival for breast cancer patients, a high percentage of patients develop resistance to chemotherapeutic agents and fail treatment. Therefore, novel approaches for the effective treatment of breast cancer are urgently needed to improve the therapeutic response. This project aims to develop a Doxorubicin loaded and target specific magnetic iron oxide nanoparticle (IONP) platform for targeted therapy of breast cancer. The proposed nanodrug can be systemically delivered and selectively accumulated at the primary and metastatic tumor sites and subsequently internalized into breast cancer cells via endocytosis. Selective enrichment of the IONP in tumor cells and the tumor environment produces strong MRI contrast for the detection of drug delivery and response in the tumor lesions by MR imaging. After demonstration of the feasibility that the engineered nanodrug can target the tumor in an animal model, the goal of this SBIR Phase II project is to extend the investigation of the successes in the Phase I study and move closer to translating this platform into preclinical trials and commercialization by further optimizing the targeted theranostic nanodrug platform for efficacy, biodistribution, toxicity, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamic studies, and future clinical trials.",

A positive outcome for these studies will allow L-Nutra to begin sales of Chemolieve.",

        "abstract": "According to the American Cancer Society 220,000 men and women in the U.S. develop lung and bronchial cancer every year and 147,000 die of the disease. Of lung cancer patients, 85% present with non-small-cell lung cancer and 16.7% of these will present with localized disease. Note that lung cancer is very difficult to treat. The five year survival for localized disease is 52%, the five year survival for more advanced disease is less than 24%.  At present, brachytherapy devices used for lung cancer treatmentconsist of metal I-125 or Cs-131 seeds, originally designed for prostate cancer, sewn to a bio-absorbable vicryl mesh. The device is not optimal for treating lung cancer. The device emits radiation in all directions and delivers radiation to otherwise healthy tissue. It is cumbersome to handle and difficult to shape to the patient s anatomy. Lung tumors are often located near critical structures sensitive to radiation exposure. Approximately 20% of patients who otherwise could be treated with lung brachytherapy are either not treated or prescribed alternative treatments due to the risk of radiation exposure to the arteries, nerves, the heart, the chest wall, the skin, and in female patients, the breasts. Those patients who are treated with the existing device are exposed to unnecessary radiation dose.  CivaTech developed, with partial support from a Phase I SBIR contract from the National Cancer Institute, a prototype brachytherapy device specifically designed for lung cancer treatment that directions radiation therapy to diseased tissue only. This device, called the CivaSheet, is planar, uni-directional and partially bio-absorbable. CivaTech is seeking Phase II support to develop the prototype into a clinic ready device.",

        "abstract": "The DNA Damage and Repair (DDR) signaling modules are among the most commonly deregulated  genes in human tumors. Deficiencies in DDR pathways are believed to influence tumorigenic processes by  promoting a mutator phenotype, which contributes to the acquisition of genetic lesions and fuels malignant  transformation. As DDR networks are extensively rewired in cancer cells, the concept of synthetic  sickness/lethality (SL) can be exploited to identify novel therapeutic target(s) for cancer.  RNA interference(RNAi) currently makes it possible to use high-throughput functional genomic  strategies for SL target identification. Unfortunately, while RNAi has opened new avenues for improving the  drug discovery process, these avenues remain only potential opportunities until we develop robust RNAi  screening technologies, which include experimental and bioinformatics tools for drug target discovery,  validation and integration into operational cell-based models. To address these issues, as outlined in the 290  SBIRcontract proposal, the development of a novel orthogonal functional genomics platform based on  validated lentiviral shRNA libraries to facilitate the discovery of SL molecular targets en masse will be required.  Accordingly, the ultimate goal of the 290SBIR research project is to develop and commercialize a human  pooled SL shRNA library that targets all of the canonical and non-canonical DDR (400x400) gene  combinations and to validate their application in RNAi screens in cancer cell models. This project will also  require the development of supporting tools, including a public SL DDR database, protocols, reagents and  software tools for in vitro screening, and the validation of the SL hits that specifically control the proliferation  and survival of cancer cells. The aforementioned genetic screening and bioinformatic tools will provide the  research community with highly modular and cost-effective approaches to understand and integrate dynamic  changes in DDR signaling networks for the discovery of novelanti-cancer SL targets.",

However, many of these antibodies are known to be poorly characterized and suboptimal across applications. Polyclonal antibodies lack the reproducibility of monoclonal antibodies. Theproduction of monoclonal antibodies is expensive and may take months. Even after production, a monoclonal antibody may not be specific for the target of interest, may not work in the needed assay, or could not be used in combination with other antibodiesdue to competition for overlapping binding domains. As such, the high cost associated with producing even small quantities of monoclonal antibodies represents a large barrier to cost-effective reagents for proteomic technology research and clinical adaptation.    This project utilizes a new tool,   massively parallel selection of DNA aptamers   to rapidly identify high-affinity ligands to hundreds or even thousands of protein targets simultaneously. In this Phase II SBIR contract, we will utilize our platform to select aptamers to at least 75 important cancer biomarker proteins and characterize the new reagents for affinity and specificity. We will also demonstrate their performance in a number of common applications.

        "abstract": "The Phase II SBIR contract proposal addresses a problem of fundamental importance for the design and analysis of Phase 3 randomized clinical trials. Over the past decade the design of such trials has been complicated by the desire to ask more than one question, within a single trial, concerning the efficacy and safety of a new therapeutic agent. For example, whereas the large phase II trials conducted in the 80s and 90s were typically two-arm tirals involving a single endpoint, it is now common to include two or more dose groups of the experimental therapy along with an active comparator and possibly placebo as well. Moreover, owing to the complex etiology of many chronic conditions, it is customary to attempt to make multiple claims of efficacy across several endpoints. As a result, contemporary clinical trials often involve multiple hierarchical objectives with logical relationships among them which are such that testing for some objective is conditional on the positive or negative outcome of the test on another objective. It is a regulatory requirement that the analysis of data from such trials, where multiple claims of efficacy may be made in teh product label, must be handled by multiple comparison procedures that guarantee strong control of the family wise error rate (FWER). Commercial grade, validated software to perform sample size calculations or generate multiplicity adjusted inferences is, however, limited. The overall goal of this project is to develop a professional, robust and commercially viablesoftware package for handling multiplicity at both the design and analysis phases of a clinical trial. The software will address the following three major sources of multiplicity: hypothesis testing of mulitple treatment arms versus a common control, hypothesis testig with respect to multiple endpoints, and group sequential testing of the same hypothesis repeatedly over information time. The software so developed will be fully integrated into Cytel&#039;s East software system.",

Human babesiosis is a malaria-like illness due to infection of red blood cells by various species of protozoan parasites belonging to the genus Babesia. Most human infections reported in the United States are caused by B. microti which is endemic in parts of the northeast and north central United States. B. microti infections are often asymptomatic but can also progress to severeillness and even death, particularly in individuals who are immunosuppressed, asplenic or elderly.  Recent cases of fatal transfusion-transmitted babesiosis have led to the identification of this pathogen as a significant threat to the blood supply. Currently no commercial, validated and FDA approved test are available for B. microti, and donor questionnaires have proven ineffective in preventing introduction of Babesia into the blood supply. Tests now in use including immunofluorescence, microscopy and PCRare not easily adaptable to high throughput blood screening. This proposal describes the development and clinical trial of a microplate-based Babesia ELISA which can be performed on an automated, high throughput platform, with the sensitivity and specificity required for blood screening. The research plan has five specific aims: 1) completion of assay development, proceeding from an optimized RandD prototype to a manufacturable kit, 2) manufacturing scale up, 3) evaluation of assay performance on blood donors from Babesia endemic and non-endemic areas in an IND clinical trial, 4) follow-up study of seropositive donors to inform donor deferral and re-entry policy, and 5) preparation and submission of a BLA application to the FDA for licensure for blood screening use.",

There are 250,000 - 400,000 sudden cardiac deaths (SCD) in the US every year, accounting for up to 20% of all deaths in adults; the majority of these are due to ventricular fibrillation. In addition, approximately 2.5 million Americans now suffer atrial fibrillation (AF), a number that is expected to surpass 5 million by 2050. Strong evidence indicates that risk for both SCD and AF include a prominent genetic component. Genetically-modified mice are a powerful model to study mechanisms underlying cardiac arrhythmias and heart failure. In larger animals, clinical pacemakers can be used to develop models of chronic AF or pacing-induced heart failure, among others. However, it has not been possible to develop similar models in transgenic or knockout mice due to the lack of availability of miniature, implantable pacemakers. Existing implantable telemetry devices for cardiac monitoring in small animals are either too large, too heavy, or have inadequate batterylife. Moreover, these devices are not able to pace the hearts, which is essential for the development of the above models. The goal of this contract is to develop a small (lt 1cc), light-weight (lt 1gram), batteryless, wireless programmable implantable device for in vivo stimulation and monitoring of cardiac electrical activity in mice and other small animals. With batteryless operation by resonant inductive power transfer and wireless operation with a standard mouse cage, such a device will be suitable for long-term, ambulatory pacing and ECG monitoring in mice.",

Recognizing the importance of cancer screening, groups like the American Cancer Society and the United States Preventative Services Task Force have developed cancer-screening guidelines. The long-term goal of this project is to increase breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screening rates by developing a two-pronged, consumer and provider-based application that is a guideline-based cancer screening decision support and tracking system that will provide cancer screening decision support to the general public and physicians; a tracking system that allows physicians to follow patients as they progress through the screening continuum; a feedback report that alerts physicians to the status of their practice's screening rates; and relevant patient education materials.\nThe technical objectives for this Phase II proposal are to 1) continue developing and refining system features related to cancer screening tracking and decision support; 2) develop integration solutions to allow this product to co-exist with other commercial EHR systems; and 3) evaluate the consumer-based and provider based products to assess their usability, acceptability, and effectiveness at increasing cancer screening guideline adherence\n",

        "abstract": "A rapid respond to outbreaks critically depends on laboratory confirmation of suspected measles cases.  In general, the turnaround times for serologic test results provided by the WHO Measles/Rubella Laboratory Network are adequate; however, results from specimens collected in remote areas can be delayed due to poor infrastructure for collection, storage and transportation of specimens.  For this reason, diagnostic assays that can be performed in field conditions may be necessary for rapid outbreak confirmation and response in some settings. There is no plan to replace the standard diagnostic approaches with rapid filed tests and results from rapid filed tests will always be confirmed in the national laboratory. However, in some settings, the availability of a rapid test would improve the timing of the public health response to an outbreak. Rapid response to measles outbreaks is critical. Argent Diagnostics has developed a bench top assay using surface enhanced raman spectroscopy (SERS) to detect measles virus that is sensitive and specific. The lower limit of detection of measles virus in a clinical sample is equivalent to that of RT-PCR. The assay can also identify the genotype of measles and could distinguish between vaccine and wild-type strains. As part of the Phase II project, Argent will adapt the measles assay to a convenient hand held device that could be used as a rapid field test in resource limited settings.The hand held device is available commercially and is being adapted for field tests for a number of viral pathogens including influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, Hendra virus and Nipah virus. Success of the Phase II project would attract funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and private companies interested in commercial viral diagnostics\n",

        "abstract": "WHO estimates that each day, 380 children die from measles and 300 children get birth defects from congenital rubella syndrome, while an unknown number die in utero from rubella, mostly in developing countries because of cost and poor access. In order to reach these populations, a vaccine for measles and rubella must be developed that is inexpensive, easy to administer and can be maintained without refrigeration. The long-term goal of this project is to produce and test a measles-rubella combination vaccine powder that can be administered nasally or dissolved in the mouth.  The primary technological innovation that makes this possible is the patented \u201cPreservation by Vaporization\u201d technology developed by the PI. In preliminary experiments with measles and other vaccines, stable powders have been produced in high yield that can be stored at least 10 months at 37\u00b0C. The specific aims of this project are: 1) Develop a formulation for stable measles-rubella vaccine powder utilizing the PBV process 2) Micronize product to an inhalable particle size 3) Prepare two alternative delivery systems a) powder inhaler b) oral melting strips 4) Test immunogenicity in non-human primates after storage at 37\u00b0C for one year. The expected results are that the vaccine will be easy to administer, very inexpensive to produce, and can be stored at ambient temperatures\n",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this Phase II SBIR project, Concordance Health Solutions (CHS) will continue development of the ScanCap System and test its effectiveness on adherence rates and hypertension patient outcomes The ScanCap System is anelectronic reminder cap that is seamlessly programmed at the pharmacy and incorporated into original packaging for prescription medications. The final product will also have the capability of recording when doses are taken and reporting that information back to caregivers and healthcare partners to improve patient medication adherence. The specific aims of the Phase II study are: Aim 1: Manufacture the ScanCap and complete development of the hardware and software to collect data stored on the device; Aim 2:Determine whether medication adherence can be improved through the use of the ScanCap compared with a placebo cap; and Aim 3: Determine whether BP control can be improved through use of the ScanCap compared with a placebo cap. Improving medication adherence is a current focus area of several NIH institutes and in line with the NIH mission to extend healthy life and reduce the burdens of illness and disability. The Scan Cap is designed to be manufactured for around  2/unit in high volumes and includes a wireless interface to automatically program the cap at the pharmacy; visual and audible reminders when a dose is due; and the ability to record doses taken and wirelessly transmit the patient medication record to an electronic database. It is small and easilyportable with a design adaptable to standard prescription vials and safety cap features. Future features will include the ability to connect with a smart phone for real-time reminders. At the conclusion of Phase II, CHS will have manufactured the ScanCapelectronic reminder cap and a prototype of the data collection system. CHS will also have demonstrated the effect of patients using the ScanCap system on medication adherence and blood pressure control. Proper adherence to prescription medication regimensis shown to improve overall health outcomes and reduce healthcare costs for many patients. However, typical medication adherence rates are less than 50 percent for a host of reasons that are both intentional in nature and unintentional, such as forgetfulness and confusion. Reminder devices on the market now are not available as part of the original prescription package, leaving the patient to sort through and implement over the counter reminder products on their own. An easy-to-use reminder cap that fits standard prescription vials will give pharmacists a tool to help their patients with medication dosing schedules. Integrating the reminder device into the pharmacy system will create patient confidence in its use and will ultimately result in increased adoption, leading to better medicatio adherence and health outcomes and lower healthcare costs.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Poor medication adherence has been described as a significant public health concern. It is widely recognized that non-compliance with medication dosing schedules limits success of treatment, contributes to disease complications, and increases hospitalizations and nursing home admissions, thereby increasing the cost of care for patients and payors. This research will study how a simplemedication reminder device dispensed as part of the original prescription packaging can improve medication adherence rates in patients who use it.",
