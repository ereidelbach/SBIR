        "abstract": "The objective is an optical periodontal probe tailored to automatically measure and record multiple tissue parameters deemed important for disease detection and treatment monitoring. As a first step in the development of a multi-functional device, a probe designed to mimic the visual measurements made by dental clinicians to determine pocket depth, bleeding on probing (BOP) and tissue coloration will be constructed. The BOP and tissue coloration measurement will serve as an indicator of present inflammatory activity, while the pocket depth measurement will be useful for longitudinal periodontal disease monitoring. The pocket depth measurement will be completed using a new scanning technique. Both BOP and tissue coloration will be determined using a straightforward optical technique. Phase I will verify that the envisioned optical probe can measure pocket depth and indicate BOP using a simulated in vivo model. Optical methods to determine other tissue parameters, including tissue coloration and sulcular pH, will be evaluated in Phase II. Clinical verification of the multi-purpose optical probe will also be completed in Phase II, when a compact, robust clinically useful prototype will be constructed.",

        "abstract": "Automated processing of sensor/signal data and other non-sensor information provides substantial force-multiplying benefits. The timely and cost-effective leveraging of these types of information provides a significant advantage over adversaries not possessing comparable information processing capabilities. The intelligent processing of diverse types of data provides a target assessment technology that can more robustly deal with a greater number battlefield scenarios and provide a real-time capability. This proposal presents an innovative approach to automatically developing target assessment models. A development tool is proposed, the Automated Target Assessment Development Environment (ATADE). The target assessment models produced by ATADE will intelligently combines multi-sensor data and non-sensor information using several advanced computing technologies [24-28]. ATADE itself will take advantage of a synergistic integration of expert systems and abductive polynomial network technologies. The result will be a well-defined methodology to extract high-level decision knowledge from low-level sensor imagery for complex battlefield decision-aiding tasks. The proposed effort uses a multi-technology approach to provided several levels of target assessment information, including position identification, capability, and significance determination. Initial feasibility of this synergistic methodology has been demonstrated under ongoing federal funding. Anticipated Benefits: ATADE will have direct applicability to other civilian and military all-source information fusion challenges, such as those for commercial and private fixed-wing aircraft, air traffic control, and air combat. ATADE will enalbe a highly automated process for quickly and cost-effectively developing information fusion solutions to a wide variety of tasks. AbTech will commercialize ATADE to the maximum extent possible by offering it commercially in a general software tool.",

The timely and cost-effective leveraging of information provides a signficant advantage over adversaries not possessing comparable information processing capabilties. Among these is automatic target recognition (ATR). Under previous and current Federal funding, AbTech has developed an innovative, robust, and effective approach to automatic target recognition The approach combines the numeric processing capabilities of abductive polynomial networks with the symbolic processing power of expert systems. The result is an ATR system that intelligently processes multi-spectral imagery (i.e., laser radar, FLIR) and non-sensor information (e.g., intelligence, mission objectives) to provide a wide range of target assessment information including detection, classification, and identification. While this sytem has been developed using actual military sensor imagery, it currently operates in an engineering environment. Issues concerning its implementation on actual avionics processors have not been addressed. Therefore, ADEPT, a VHDL-based approach for determining the actual processing requirements for informatin processing algorithms, will be used to determine the implementation feasibility of the ATR system. Also, the applicability of the ASAAT methodology for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery has not been considered. A complementary objective of this effort is to identify the dual-use and commercial potential for ASAAT technology.",

It can also be caused by inefficiencies in the inner loop controllers, such as time delays and phase and rate limits.  PIO represents a significant danger to aircraft and has resulted in a number of high profile accidents, such as the crash of the YF-22.  Some of the most experienced pilots have had PIOs.

At the present time there are no generally available software tools for utilizing experimental data to correct and refine models implemented on general-purpose codes such as DYNA3D.  Nor are there tools available for evaluating the predictive accuracy of these models.  This project will demonstrate the feasibility of using a generic algorithm for discrete optimization to eliminate systematic modeling error and make coarse parameter adjustments to obtain models suitable for continuous parameter estimation.  Improved methods for defining response metrics and corresponding parameter sets based on the use of Principle Components and singular value decomposition will also be demonstrated.  These advances will be used to enhance the effectiveness of Bayesian parameter estimation for \u00bffine-tuning\u00bf the nonlinear models produced by discrete optimization.  The use of a Bayesian estimator with improved response metrics and associated parameter sets will yield statistical estimates of residential model uncertainty for use in evaluating the predictive accuracy of the refined models.  The proposed project will result in the development of new methods for verification and validation of nonlinear structural models.  These methods may be used to reduce time-to-market and testing costs for a variety of Government and commercial applications including survivability and vulnerability analyses of military structures and crash worthiness studies of commercial automobiles.

These sensor pads could be integrated into the flight deck surface below the grated rubber surface finish.  These thin (20-30 mils) piezopolymer sensing pads could be integrated in such a fashion as to not require additional time or mainpulation of the aircraft as they prepare for launch.  Local electronic signal conditioning would enhance the fidelity and accuracy of the measurement.  For ease of integration, the conditioned signals can be transmitted for catapult settings via an RF transmitter if such an integration requirements is specified.  Such a sensing system would be low cost and low maintenance.  ACX proposes to investigate the feasiblity of this aircraft weighing system based on thin film piezopolymer sensors.

The source will use a fixed frequency diode pumped solid state drive laser and an optical parametric oscillator, tunable from 1.6 to 2.4 microns.  Output energies will be over 100 micro-J through the spectral range at pulse rates of 10kHz.  The major technical challenge, addressed directly in Phase I, is the short pulse, high PRF operation of the complete driver/OPO system.  The proposed Phase I effort tests a novel, moderate power, short pulse drive laser and demonstrates OPO conversion with both conventional and advanced OPO materials.  The needed drive laser specifications (pulse rate 10 kHz, power 10 to 20W, pulse duration of 10ns, and compact design) are difficult to meet simultaneously.  A cavity dumping technique will be implemented on an existing DP laser to show short pulses suitable for OPO applications.  The drive laser used in Phase I has a substantial technical pedigree, and will enable definitive experiments.  Supporting analysis with state of the art laser and OPO design codes is pivotal to the design.  A plan for the development, compacting and delivery of a rugged device using the most appropriate technology choices is developed.",

        "abstract": "High pulse energy, high repetition rate, tunable, narrowband sources are needed for optical pumping of mid-infrared gas laser converters.  The source needs continuous tunability over the 1-3 micron band to access different overtone bands in various gaseous gain media.  Due to the need for diode pumping of the source, efficiency is critical to minimizing diode costs.  Our approach is efficient generation of the 1-3 micron output with an injection-seeded optical parametric oscillator-optical parametric amplifier (OPO/OPA) system.  The pump beam for the OPO/OPA system is the fundamental or second harmonic of a Hd:YAG laser.  The key innovation is dramatic enhancement of the conversion efficiency in the OPA by resonantly feeding back the unconverted pump beam. Pump feedback is accomplished with a resonant ring cavity built around the OPA.  Theoretical OPO conversion efficiencies (pump to signal + idler) are near 30% without feedback, and between 75-80% with feedback.  System efficiency is examined further through a preliminary design study on the diode-pumped drive laser. Alternative materials such as Yb:YAG are more effective storage media than Nd:YAG>  thus, there is tremendous potential for reducing the diode laser requirement, and thus the cost.  The Phase I objectives are to demonstrate efficient conversion in a pump feedback OPA through experimental and analytical efforts, and define the architecture of the diode-pumped drive laser.

Once developed, the instrumentation and methodology could be interfaced with a reaction sample characterization before and after treatment.  The project has been divided into two phases.  Phase I consists primarily of research and design of the required instrumentation, which would subsequently be constructed and developed during Phase II.  In this Phase I proposal, we propose to investigate the applicability of high-performance, high-energy Auger electron spectroscopy for the characterization of contaminated soil samples, and to design a custom instrument capable of producing two-dimensional images of the samples from the viewpoint of each element.  This approach is promising for the examination of contaminated soils because Auger spectroscopy is particularly sensitive to high atomic number elements (such as heavy metals), and the use of high-energy Auger electrons allows selectivity from the lighter elements typically abundant in soils.  Such instrumentation is not readily available, as it involves the application of some of the most recent advances in surface analysis.",

We propose to customize METEOR to handle the access requirements as imposed by the CDF, NetCDF, and HDF scientific data models.  In particular this will involve clustering techniques to optimize access to large multidimensional datasets through temporal, spatial, or special sampling ordering rules. In Phase I we propose to demonstrate a prototype system utilizing one of the above data formats integrated with the METEOR data management system.  This will involve a set of extraction and composition filters to populate the METEOR databases with metadata from the scientific datasets against which standard spatial and temporal, or attribute based queries can be formulated.  The datasets retrieved from the data management system using the composition filters, can be merged into a single dataset for analysis.

Furthermore, substitutional modifications offer the possibility for drastically reduced drive voltages necessary for actuation.  A significant opportunity exists to develop a new process for deposition of a thin film microactuator material based on PZT.  Metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) is the method of choice because it yields excellent microcrystallinity, has high deposition rates, and scales to large areas.  Preliminary results at ATMI indicate that the deposition of high quality substitutionally modified thin films based on PZT is possible by MOCVD.

The question is: which technology, II-VI materials, III-V nitrides, or silicon carbide and its alloys, will dominate? Theoretical calculations and experimental external quantum efficiencies combined favor a direct band gap material; the mechanical properties of the III-Vs are superior to the II-VIs; contact technology is more mature in silicon carbide. We propose a novel high brightness blue LED based on GaN heterostructures grown by chemical vapor deposition on conductive silicon carbide substrates to take advantage of both the nitride and silicon carbide materials systems. The GaN heterostructure will use a resonant optical cavity analogous to those used in ALGaAs LED technology for increased efficiency. Phase I will be devoted to the fabrication of distributed Bragg reflectors (DBRs) using a multilayer stack of GaN/A1N. In Phase II, a complete GaN LED structure will be fabricated and the performance enhancement provided by the resonant cavity structure will be determined. In Phase III, bright blue LEDs will be manufactured and the GaN-based technology will be extended to other optoelectronics including lasers for communications and optical storage. Anticipated Benefits: The availability of high brightness blue LEDs based on the resonant cavity structure could make full color solid state display viable. The additional bonus of a narrow emission linewidth provided by the resonant cavity could allow solid state blue light emitters to be used in WDM fiber optic networks or for high density magneto-otpic data storage devices",

The program will couple breakthroughs in HTS Josephson junction and thin film fabrication technology for silicon substrates. We will investigate two processing routes towards a monolithic Josephson junction technology on silicon, both of which have previously yielded junctions with excellent rf properties on metal oxide substrates.

        "abstract": "Traditionally, kinematic measurements have been made using electro-mechanical transducers which produce a signal which is proportional to the parameter being measured. This approach is unlikely to be replaced by optical tracking techniques, but there are many instances where it is impractical (or even impossible) to attach a mechanical device to the subject. The blades of a helicopter rotot are an excellent case-in-point. While a better understanding of blade kinematics is fundamental to the design of the aircraft, it is difficult to recover three-dimensional kinematics by traditional means under operational conditions. 4D Video believes that an image-based motion measurement system can be used to quantify the rigid-body dynamics of helicopter rotor blades under operational conditions. We propose to investigate the most appropriate means for achieving this objective. Our purpose is to develop a specification which will form the foundation of an SBIR Phase II proposal to develop new hardware and software to perform the required tasks. For the purpose of the present proposal, our effort will focus on two issues: sample-rate, and the development of a customized (circular) tracking algorithm which will take maximum advantage of the predominant motions of the rotor blades. However, other issues have been identified and will be addressed.",

In this SBIR Phase I effort an approach is proposed which will modify a flow code similar to the LANMIN code to include these effects.  A companion conduction code, similar to the EXITS code, will be tailored to the thermal structural geometries of the Holloman rocket sled.  The operation of this code will be compatible with the output of the flow code.  The shock impingement effects will incorporate the results from NASA TN D-7139 and other available analytical/experimental work on this effect.  The equilibrium real air Mollier tables will be made sufficiently large to include the extreme temperature associated with mach 10 operation in the Holloman atmospheric conditions.  The Mollier tables for helium will be installed for computing the heating on the sled when passing through that gas.  The resultant codes will allow the Holloman Test Group to compute the thermal protection (TPS) requirements at critical locations on the sled and the bond-line temperature between the TPS and that tests of candidate TPS materials can be performed to develop the TPS needed for the rocket sled - the ultimate objective of the program.  The Phase II commercialization potential includes other hypersonic vehicle applications (like the NASP concept) within the aerospace industry; and industrial situations requiring TPS material for high temperature, high heat-rate environments, such as material casting and extrusion facilities (steel and aluminum).",

        "abstract": "Spatial light modulators are the limited component of optical signal processors. Electronic modulators, including liquid crystals and magento-optic modulators, are expensive, low resolution, and slow. The optical disk offers high resolution at moderate cost. The \"pixel\" size is on the order of one micron. The total system works to this accuracy by using an active feedback controlled system for alignment and focus. The optical disk spins, moving new areas under the read/write mechanism. In an optical processor, the movement of the disk and head would bring new images or filters into alignment quickly. AOS proposes to focus a Phase I program on the use of the disk as a modulator for a spatial filter. Several programs, including those at our company and many at the Army Missile Command, have realized that feeding large numbers of matched filters through an optical processor is the bottleneck. A unique aspect of our proposal is an intention to study both the magneto-optic disk, and the PhotoCD(tm). There are advantages and disadvantages to each. Anticipated Benefits: The government has numerous programs in optical processing which will benefit by this technology, including ARPA's TOPS. The R&D market is ready for such a device. We will have industrial support during Phase II to develop a commercial modulator. Our sights are even higher - such a modulator could make other commercial applications of optical processing practical.",

The Fourier transform of an image represents the information in terms of angles and spatial frequencies.  In this case we are interested only in the angles. The transform of a missile-like target is dominated by one dashed line.  The location of this line does not vary with the location of the target in the field of view.  The location does not vary with the scale (and thus range) of the target.  Even if the target is briefly obscured, there is no need to \"search\" for the image or the data - in the Fourier  transform plane is it just there.  This transform approach makes the analysis of data gathering easy, rapid, and very accurate, at the expense of having to perform the 2-D spatial Fourier Transform.",

Due to practical considerations of memory and mass storage, most PC-based tutorials must use canned scenarios that limit the scope of a student's interaction. Recent advances in network technology have allowed PC's to act as smart terminals and remotely share access tomemory, mass storage and CPU capacity of more powerful UNIX based computers and workstations. ART has developed FLIGHTLAB, a software tool for interactive design, simulation and analysis of rotorcraft that utilizes the computational power and X-window interface of UNIX base workstations. ART proposes to develop a PC-based tutorial on handling qualities and control system specification that provides extensive interactive access to FLIGHTLAB through a network connection to a UNIX workstation running FLIGHTLAB. This tutorial would utilize FLIGHTALAB's flight test planning and analysis interface and simulation capability to allow students to alter design configurations, conduct simulated flight tests on the design vehicle, and analyze the results. Those with direct access to the FLIGHTLAB workstation could then correlate the analysis with a piloted evaluation using FLIGHTLAB'S real time capability.

        "abstract": "We propose a new approach to automatic target recognition based on the concept of stochastically deformable templates. In contrast to conventional static approaches, our concept is based on active image tracking. It allows for simultaneous image processing, parameter estimation, and filtering. High target signature variability captured by optical, infrared, millimeter-wave and microwave radar acoustic sensors, etc. substantially diminishes the effective- ness of these technologies in automatic target recognition systems. In this proposal, we address related problems of effective representation and processing of target signatures subject to random fluctuations. Our approach is to represent randomly perturbed dynamically evolving images using the emerging mathe- matical technique of wavelet descriptors for stochastically deformable templates. The wavelet descriptor has many desirable properties including multiresolution representation, invariance, uniqueness, stability and spatial localization. Real time processing of randomly evolving target signatures is seriously restricted by limitations on availability of communication channels, bandwidth length, computer power, etc. One way to circumvent these difficulties is the dynamic distribution of resolution, so that the maximum resolution windows are applied to a small number of the image landmarks. To achieve this goal, we propose a new method of template deformation tracking and prediction, based on the nonlinear filtering approach. Specifically, we use a new fast spectral algorithm for nonlinear filtering. By separation of observations and parameters, this algorithm shifts the main bulk of computations off line. The main objective of the project is to demonstrate that the recent breakthroughs in wavelet-based image descriptors and fast nonlinear filtering make feasible the real-time implementation of our approach.",

Beginning with a proven, qualified design completed by NASA in the 60's, PacAstro proposes to apply modern materials and manufacturing techniques, combined with highly integrated design and development procedures proven by us in development of other low cost, highly capable space systems, to produce a high performance engine suitable for upper stage applications at costs 1% to 5% of currently existing engines.  Under the proposed program we will design, analyze, build and deliver an advanced, low cost, light weighted injector for the engine.

        "abstract": "High intensity cooling of expansion turbine blades is proposed, using a self-stabilized evaporation/condensation process within each blade.  The result is low blade structural temperature, with waste heat delivered to a low pressure air flow.  This is a key technology requirement for development of a fully cooled gas turbine, with potential for operation at radically increased turbine inlet temperature, while avoiding high cost superalloys. The approach provides uniform and stable cooling of the entire blade, with the evaporated coolant flowing as vapor to the blade root, where it condenses while transferring heat to low pressure air flow.  The key to achieving uniform evaporative cooling is establishment of a liquid flow, driven by the centrifugal acceleration field of the turbine, filling numerous transverse capture shelves on the inside blade wall surfaces.  It cascades from the inner shelf outward, with vapor from each returning to the root region for condensation and recycle.  The high acceleration field forces highly efficient nucleate pool boiling at each shelf, resulting in metal temperature close to the liquid boiling point. Thus a fully enclosed Return Flow Cascade of alkali metal coolant is established.  The Phase I program will experimentally validate this approach under high acceleration conditions.",

The availability of the phase Doppler instrument has permitted simultaneous measurement of droplet size, velocity, and number density of fuel droplets in spray flames.  However, the measurement of individual fuel droplet temperatures not been possible thus far.  This proposal deals with diagnostic development for droplet temperature measurement in addition to droplet size and velocity in spray flames.  The diagnostic instruments consists of rainbow refractometer which is fully integrated to a phase Doppler particle analyzer.  The droplet size and velocity is measured with the phase Doppler particle analyzer and the droplet refractive index is measured with the rainbow refractometer.  Sbusequently, the fuel droplet temperature is inferred from the droplet refractive index using a known relationship between the variation of the fuel refractive index with temperature.  Various innovative techniques have been proposed to minimize errors resulting from droplet inhomogeneity and for increasing the measurement accuracy.",

The matrix polymers that make graphite-composites manufactured using this process possible are based on electron-beam curing of low viscosity Epoxy Functionalized Siloxane (EFS) polymers that have been shown to resist atomic oxygen, while exhibiting excellent mechanical and physical properties.  This resin can be specially formulated with other low cost resins, toughener thermoplastic powers, and a proprietary low-dose-to-cure catalyst to lower the resins cost as well as improve on the already tougher-than-epoxy, hydrophobic, high Tg (>250 C) properties of the base resign.

The key feature is that each reporting node in the system is a transceiver that acts as independent data transfer switch. Each transceiver will automatically adapt to network fault problems, data errors, and change data routing patterns without human intervention. Radio packet transmnissions will permit encryption and the use of anti-jamming techniques. AES will develop the software protocols and hardware needed to build a demonstration system which will automatically reconfigure and optimize the security network to pass data between each node and a central control. AES has extensive overseas and domestic experience in designing and installing radio based security systems.

The medical community has not been satisfied with the imaging performance of standardfilm-screen in its ability to produce the required quality images. Recently, there has been a desire toresolve 50 micromoles structures with very high detection efficiency. This technique would allow a veryhigh spatial resolution, superior to slow film-screen, with an efficiency greater than fast film-screen.

        "abstract": "Current research in structural biology is focused on understanding the role of enzymes andproteins in regulating cellular metabolism and the way drugs bind to proteins so that more effective drugswhich can inhibit viral activity may be developed. Macromolecular crystallography provide informationregarding 3D distributions of atoms in biological molecules, and is an important factor in understandingthe mechanisms of such diseases as cancer and AIDS. New X-ray sources like the synchrotron beamsources as well as the new beam lines now under development such as the Advanced Photon Sourcehold great promise for macromolecular crystallography. They have not yet realized their potential dueto the lack of an appropriate position sensitive sensor. To address these specific needs, we propose todevelop a novel, large area X-ray imaging sensor coupled to a CCD using a fiberoptic taper demagnifier.This microstructured plate will produce a combination of greater light output and resolution than standardphosphors, allowing the imaging devices to use greater demagnification tapers and hence a large fieldof view. For detecting X-ray energies typically used in biological macromolecular crystallography, thissensor will provide high resolution, high detection efficiency, and a fast time response, allowing the fullpotential of the modern synchrotron sources to be realized.",

        "abstract": "Today's tactical aircraft employ sophisticated onboard sensors which can be managed in several dimensions, including spatial focus, sensing modality, and temporal scheduling.  Effective mission operations, such as air interdiction and counter air, require efficient sensor control and scheduling that accounts for the limited availability of sensor resources to support all current sensor tasks, as well as the need to plan for a variety of future contingencies.  This effort develops a theoretical foundation for sensor management based on stochastic dynamic programming, leading to nonmyopic algorithms that utilize statistical track and identification information from an aircraft's sensor fusion system to predict the effects of future sensor management decisions.  Novel open-loop feedback and closed-loop feedback solution methodologies are proposed which are adaptive and even-driven, continually replanning on the basis of the most recent information.  Closed-loop feedback approaches improve upon open-loop feedback by using explicit stochastic models to hedge against uncertain future events.  We further propose to investigate an innovative approach, neuro-dynamic programming, for computing closed-loop feedback solutions.  We will evaluate the algorithms, and select one for demonstration in a prototype sensor management algorithm operating on a simple air interdiction scenario.",

In spite of this demand, surprisingly little support from CAD vendors exists for automated low power circuit design.  Alternative System Concepts (ASC) and Princeton University propose to design and develop a much needed power optimizing design automation tool incorporating recent research advances in the area of high-level synthesis for low power.  The proposed development tightly couples advanced research at Princeton and innovative VHDL-based CAD tools developed by ASC.  The new tool will implement VHDL behavioral synthesis for low power, transforming a behavioral VHDL description into a structural VHDL description, optimized for power dissipation.  Power minimization will be achieved by simultaneously applying:  1) voltage scaling for fixed throughput; 2) minimization of switching activity in the circuit; 3) reduction of capacitive loads through minimization of module count and interconnect.  Combining low power, area, and performance as co-objectives in the synthesis process will ensure globally optimal designs.  Existing and newly developed methods for transformation, scheduling, and allocation will be integrated into ASC's FRITS object-oriented VHDL framework.",

The ribonuclease protection assay is an increasingly utilized techniquein molecular biology affording sensitive and quantitative measurement of mRNA levels. The ability ofthe assay to detect multiple mRNA levels simultaneously makes this technique a unique and powerfultool for use in research and diagnostic applications. In a ribonuclease protection assay, autoradiographyof the polyacrylamide gel-resolved products represents the endpoint of the experiment. However, allof the available nonisotopic detection protocols require blotting of nucleic acids onto a sold support priorto detection. Therefor, we propose an approach which will circumvent this requirement and allowdetection directly in the gel used to resolve the nucleic acids. Our initial studies demonstrated that invitro transcripts containing 4-thiouridine are both functional in ribonuclease protection assays and canbe detected in gel down to 1 picomole by a colormetric detection protocol using N-ethylamaleimide andbase. During phase I, we will synthesize a derivative of N-ethylmaleimide which has been reported togreatly potentiate the sensitivity of thiol detection. Furthermore, in an effort to extend the sensitivityof ribonuclease protection assays beyond that attainable with radioactivity, we will synthesize a thiolatedderivative of the chemiluminescent molecule isoluminol. This derivative will be coupled to either4-thiouridine- or 5 mercuriuridine-substituted transcripts and detected using a non-enzymatic, butcatalytic, oxidation system with molecules which can all readily diffuse in and out of a polyacrylamidegel matrix. Once we have developed a nonisotopic ribonuclease protection assay, it will be utilized witha panel of oncogene and tumor suppressor gene probes which are used extensively at Ambion for thedevelopment of single base mismatch technologies. Ultimately, the technologies which we develop willhave wide applications in molecular biology research extending beyond ribonuclease protection assays.",

        "abstract": "An operational requirement is projected for an inexpensive, mobile, submarine acoustic countermeasure capability.  A significant tactical advantage is gained by putting as much distance as possible between the submarine (launch platform) and the mobile countermeasure.  An additional advantage is gained if the submarine has the ability to place the ADC between itself and the torpedo threat.  Adding a propulsion capability with a guidance and control system to a conventional ADC ME2 MOD 1 device would achieve this capability.  This proposal puts forth a conceptual design for the integration of a propulsion, guidance and control capability into a conventional ADC MK2 MOD 1 device.  An inexpensive and producible design for a prototype mobile ADC MK2 MOD 1 countermeasure is proposed which will meet the propulsion requiremetn of 20 knots for 3 minutes. The propulsion system integration into the ADC fixed size package is make possible through innovative use of power gneration, materials, depth control and integrated circiutry component technologies.  All of these technologies are within the stat of the art.  The proposed conceptual design minimizes the design risk and meets operational and cost expectations by maximizing the use of existing ADC MK2 MOD 1 production hardware.",

A major portion of the weight is in the fuel cell stack, a stack of carbon electrodes with metal bipolar plate separators that are sandwiched between two end plates and held in place by tie rods.  We continue to investigate lighter weight materials to use in our conventional fuel cell stack.  However, in this effort we propose to investigate an innovative design, the strip cell stack, that completely eliminates the bipolar plates, end plates and tie rods.  The strip stack is 4.6 times lighter than a bipolar fuel cell stack.  In a conventional Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cell stack, electrons and protons are conducted perpendicular to the electrode plane.  In the strip cell design, ionic conduction is perpendicular to the plane of the electrodes while electron flow is in the plane of the electrodes.  Phase I will demonstrate the feasibility of the design with a 4 cell \"substack.\"  In Phase II we will build a coiled 300 watt cell \"stack.\"  The coiled strip cell stack is formed from a sheet of planar strip cells rolled together and placed inside a thin lightweight plastic tube.  The 300 watt strip cell stack should fit in a tube which is about 8.9 cm. in diameter and 20.3 cm. long. The total weight should be slightly over 1 Kg.",

It has demonstrated the ability to predict leading-edge vortices and shock capturing; consequently, challenging design problems, such as complete wing/body/nacelle shape tailoring, can be addressed.  To investigate the requirements needed for integration of Euler solver, a study will be made of an aeroeleastic analysis at Mach 1.25 of the Multidisciplinary Wing described in the ASTRES Applications manual.

Aluminum near the surface is depleted through scale formation, and replenished through diffusion from the interior. Platinum additions enhance the protectiveness of nickel-aluminide coatings because they increase the aluminum replenishment rate. The new coatings will use two-phase-glass (TPG) overlayers that will reduce aluminum depletion rates, and less-expensive platinum group (Pg) additions that will maintain increased aluminum replenishment rates over nickel-aluminide coatings. Coupons with TPG overlayers and selected Pg aluminides will be prepared and subjected to short-term, realistic oxidation, hot corrosion, and thermal cycling tests on a laboratory scale.

        "abstract": "A fundamental problem in automatic target recognition (ATR) is the overwhelming amount of sensor data which must be processed. Target features are localized within the field-of-view (FOV) of the imaging sensor. Uniformly sampling within the FOV is thuus inappropriate, regions with little or no relevance to the task are samples at the same resolution as key features, occupying valuable signal bandwidth and computational resources, and increasing system latencies. Foveal active vision features imaging sensors and processing with graded acuity coupled with context sensitive gaze control, analogous to that prvalent throughout vertebrate vision. Foveal vision operates more efficiently in dynamic scenarios than uniform acuity vision because resolution is treated as a dynmaically allocatable resource, simultaneously achieving wider field-of-view, greater localized resolution, and faster frame rates with significantly reduced processing requirements. The proposed program will develop commercially feasible foveal vision technology and integrate it into a Hierarchical Foveal Machine Vision System for ATR applications. The system uses rectilinear multiresolution sampling and processing which together exploit existing algorithms and hardware, ensure component feasiblity, accelerate prototyping and commercilaization, and reduce manufacturing costs. Hierarchical processing further reduces hardware requirements and accelerates system response.",

DIS developers are focusing on solutions to interoperability issues, particularly terrain.  This is extremely important for air-to-ground applications.  Good latency for intra-laboratory applications with Ethernet has been observed, and use of SCRAMNet could provide even better performance.  The \"plug and play\" capability of DIS has been well demonstrated.  It is a powerful tool for the rapid construction of test scenarios.

The next step to be carried out is a detailed evaluation of demonstrated hardware approaches for specific application in the candidate AEW radar system.  Key component areas to consider are photonic true time delay devices, lightwave transmit-receive beamforming manifolds and monolithic microwave/opto-electric integrated circuit T/R modules for the active aperture. Optical time delay networks are broadband and eliminate the need to compensate for beam squinting in large aperture arrays.  Lightwave beamforming manifolds for phased arrays have been demonstrated for both transmit and receive applications that can be packaged very compactly and are comparatively small in size and weight. In addition, this study would seek to exploit the developments of monolithic microwave and photonic gallium arsenide circuits carried out under the ARPA sponsored MIMIC Program during the past five years that has enabled special and multi-purpose transmit/recieve (T/R) modules to be manufactured by several companies. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS: The photonic technology insertion to be investigated for the AEW surveillance radar application lends itself also, to space-based and ground airport surveillance radars used for commercial and general aviation traffic control purposes.

        "abstract": "In printed circuit board manufacturing, the patterning technology determines not only the ultimate packaging density, but also the economics of the entire process via throughput and yield. Conventional contact and projection printing methods have various shortcomings such as defect generation, mask life degradation, and image field size limitation. Existing direct writing approaches with a focused beam suffer from slow speed and inefficient writing lasers, typical direct-write processing speeds being 0.5 sq. ft./min or less. This proposal presents a program for developing a novel patterning system that not only delivers high resolution over a large image field, but alos produces high exposure throughput and eliminates the shortcomings of conventional systems. It can deliver a throughput . 12 sq. ft./min (i.e., more than an order of magnitude higher than before) with 0.2 mil resolution. These results are achieved by a novel scan-and repeat exposure mechanism which enables seamless exposure of large substrates with a resolution of a few microns. In Phase I we will design a system based on the new concept and demonstrate its feasibility with a breadboard assembly. We will also prepare a cost study to compare the new technology with existing approaches. In Phase II we will design, build and evaluate a fully operational prototype system, which will be developed into a product to be introduced to market in Phase III. Anticipated Benefits: The proposed system will make it possible to print finer patterns on printed circuit boards with higher throughput and lower cost. Finer resolution translates into higher packaging density as well as superior performance, e.g., higher speed. These advances will benefit numerous electronic systems, including high-speed computers, electronics for avionics and space exploration, military electronics, mass storage systems, and instrumentation. Anvik's novel patterning system will also be highly attractive in the production of flat-panel displays, multichip modules, and high-density semiconductor chips.",

The novel device is designed to monitor the hydrocarbons in waste water in real time and will serve as a tool to minimize the release of contaminated water into local waste-water systems. Current monitoring is performed by visual inspection based on the presence of an oil sheen. Such inspection can not be satisfied continuously and the location of inspection may not necessarily be the point of release. The proposed remote sensor system has a unique structure that is inexpensive, sensitive, reliable, usable in diverse environments, and universal for the detection of various oils. The data collected by the sensor can be sent to an operation center. Warning signals will also be sent if an oil sheen in waste water is detected. The proposed system can also be modified for quantitative monitoring of oil in water. The proposed remotely deployable sensor will be sensitive and reliable. It can be used for detecting oil in waste water from testing facilities, processing plants, refineries, aviation facilities, fuel storage facilities, and any location where oil contamination in water needs to be monitored. The technology needed to build these devices has already been established under programs at Apollo Enterprise directed toward optical instruments for thin film measurements. Apollo Enterprise proposes to use this technology to develop a highly sensitive remote sensor system that will be an effective tool in environmental monitoring and protection. The development of the sensor system will also be economically advantageous because it can provide early warning of contamination to avoid a costly clean-up process.",

        "abstract": "Health professionals must often analyze disease cluster allegations made by concerned citizens who sense patterns within small structured environments. Examples include households, families, sibships, wards, cellblocks, classrooms, job types, age classes, and locations within a building. It is crucial for the health professional to know what tests are best in these small-environment problems. A few large-scale methods may be modified to handle small-environment problems. However, exact methods may be better because sample sizes are small. We have extended previous matrix-occupancy methods to yield new, rapid, and exact combinatorial expressions for analysis of patterns of diseased individuals. We will investigate the power of both these and other previously-published methods in structured small environments. To our knowledge, no such systematic investigation has been carried out. We expect that many test methods will be optimal in a restricted range of the parameter space, but not ideal elsewhere. Our long-range goal is to use the results of this power simulation to choose methods for incorporation into a user-friendly PC program that will analyze small structured environment data. We will also help the professional choose the right test method.",

        "abstract": "There is a global trend towards utilization of satellite communications for information services.  Equivalent system temperature, Ts, is a significant parameter in quantifying the antenna system/link performance, because it represents the noise power spectral density in antenna system figures-of-merit, such as receiver gain/system temperature (G/T), and end-to-end Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR).  Unfortunately, Ts is dependent on many parameters.  This presents a significant problem in predicting system performance in the operational environment (indoors - the antenna sees roughly the ambient temperature, outdoors - the antenna sees many other noise sources that may vary significantly over time).  An innovative computer methodology is proposed that uses a novel application of noise theory and an integration of new and existing algorithms to estimate a statistical \"worst case\" in the operating environment based upon a desired availability.  The specific objectives of the Phase I effort are to:  develop a method to measure the composite system noise fugure; develop a statistical method for predicting system ambient operating temperature; develop a method to statistically estimate equivalent antenna temperature; and select supporting computer algorithms.  The technical approach is to resolve each objective by addressing the individual uncertainties and unknowns of the methodology.",

However, there are several technical issues that need to be addressed to harness this potential of high-speed networking technology. One ofthese is the development of a new generation of communication protocol architectures to meet the new requirements of gagbit/second wide area networks. Architecture Technology Corporation proposes the design of a new protocol architecture for high-speed netowrks that would enable efficient and easy access to digital libraries of electronic information that would be part of the National Information Infrastructure (NII). Our approach applies two innovative techniques to the deisgn of information retrieval protocols: 1) application-level data segmentation; and 2) application specific protocol configuration. The proposed Phase I effort seeks to establish the feasibility of the two proposed techniques for designing information retrieval protocols by developing a detailed design of the new protocol architecture and analytically evaluating the performance gains offered by the new architecture. Anticipated Benefits: The results of the proposed research can be applied to develop a commercial software product that would allow end-users to easily access information on the National Information Ifrastructure.",

        "abstract": "Codling moth, Cydia pomonella, is a major exotic pest of walnuts, apples and pears in California.  Current control practices, using the application of conventional pesticides, are costly, toxic and declining in effectivenss.  Of additional concern in California is that many walnut orchards are planted along major river systems in former riparian zones where growers are or will be required to use environmentally safe management practices.  Trichogramma, a minute parasitic wasp completing its development within eggs of host moths, effectively meets this requirement.  Present application methods used in walnuts are not optimal.  Aerial application of Trichogramma parasitoids to the orchard canopy will increase the wasp's success in controlling codling moth, improve crop yields and substantially reduce pesticide applications.  This project proposes to:  1) evaluate existing aerial equipment, modifying or redesigning as necessary, to apply Trichogramma parasitoids to the orchard; 2) evaluate carrier materials and survivability of parasitoids when applied with each unit; 3) evaluate lateral distribution of parasitoids applied by air; and 4) evaluate the addition of glue at application to hold the parasitoids in the canopy, increasing the wasp's successful breeding and subsequent parasitism of codling moth eggs.",

The displays are thin film (2 mm) flexible devices based on poly(diphenyl amine) and structurally related Conducting Polymers (CPs . A uniqe design and unique counter electrode reaction permits very high faradaic reversibility, and the devices are routinely taken to 10**6 cycles over a few days while operating for months. They show a variety of Visible colors, open circuit memory over several weeks, ms switching times, and charge capacity less than 0.0008 C/cm**2. The Phase I work will adapt this technology, using several CP/dopant systems, to fabrication of 3X3, 9-pixel matrices of 1 cm**2 pixels, each individually addressable, and an accompanying controller. The work emphasizes the combined IR+Visible capability of the technology and its flexible, thin film nature. Phase II work will miniaturize to I mm, individually addressable pixels in a 10 cm X 10 cm matrix, employing technology that includes microelectronic fabrication tech- niques. The high dynamic ranges in both Visible and IR regions appear to be unique to these CP systems, not found e.g. in liquid crystals.",

With current resin systems, this is only achievable through elevated cure cycling, translating to added costs throughout the manufacturing process and a reduced composite damage tolerance.  To meet the challenge of high temperature performance with reduced processing costs and increased damage tolerance, Aspen proposes the development of a new class of epoxy resins amenable to room temperature curing.  The proposed system initiates a close functional group packing density, allowing complete conversion at substantially below the polymers final glass transition temperature.  The result is a high temperature, high strength polymer cured at room temperature with enhanced damage tolerance.  Designed from the molecular level, this system represents the leading edge in epoxy functional monomer design research, and the maximum opportunity for significant cost reductions in aerospace quality composite fabrication.

        "abstract": "An important facet to a soldier's survivability depends on the clothing worn during combat and training exercises.  Common fibers used in the textile industry, particularly nylons and polyesters, are flammable, produce toxic smoke and are potentially hazardous when worn soldiers.  Flame retardant materials applied directly to these fibers may adversely alter the properties of the fabric and/or degrade through use.  As a result, microencapsulation serves as a viable alternative solution.  Microencapsulation protects the FR material from environmental water and washing; protects it against rugged wear conditions; and protects it against degradation due to heat and sun light; while maintaining the desired properties of the fabric such as breatability, flexibility and strength.  Soldier survivability will be improved by microencapsulating FR materials and incorporating them into textiles used by the U.S. Army including; clothing, tentage and individual equipment.  Aspen Systems' will investigate available FR materials, encapsulation techniques andd incorporation methods through the use of advanced molecular modeling techniques.  The most promising FR materiels will then be microencapsulated and incorporated into new and existing synthetic and natural fibers.  Aspen Systems has teamed with Southwest Research Institute, a recognized leader in microencapsulation technology, to investigate compatible microencapsulation processes and perform microencapsulation of FR materials.",

This system will offer greater resolution and versatility than has been previously available.  Using illumination from a compact laser diode, the new camera will resolve the image of an object (projectile, for instance) obstructed by intense ambient light (explosive fumes).  Furthermore, each captured frame will simultaneously provide both a projectile image and the plume image. Our proposed high speed (up to 25,0000 frames per second) camera will be designed as a user friendly device.  It will be made perfectly compatible with the High Speed Test Track (HSTT) site environment, remotely operable and computer controlled.  Included among the attractive camera features are :  Image recording by an electronic array sensor, electrooptical shutter thus no moving mechanical parts, controllable and eyeshade illumination by the laser diode.  To develop the novel camera, Aspen Systems will lead a team of nationally renowned experts in high speed photography, lasers and electrooptics.  In Phase I we will assemble a laboratory prototype of the camera and perform experiments photographing objects obstructed by intense light.  On analyzing the data, a deployable high speed camera will be designed.  In Phase II, the new camera will be fabricated and tested at the HSTT site.",

These devices were fabricated by liquid-phase epitaxy on GaSb substrates. They represent some of the longest emission wavelengths ever reported for uncooled semiconductor injection lasers.

This system will enable home care agencies to maximize their human resources and to reduce their service costs. Phase I is to identify the issues dealing with scheduling and coordinating of nurses and home health aides. A pilot system will be implemented and tested as part of the investigation. Phase II will develop a final system based on the pilot system with enhancements. Applying the latest computer graphic, mapping and database technologies, a pilot system which combines street maps with patients and nurses database will be developed. The system will first prepare a list of daily visits for each nurse. Locations of all visits with patients and other related information will be displayed on the mapping screen. A set of procedures will then be applied for creating routes, modifying existing ones, evaluating alternatives, and print route maps and directions. By adding a visual component to the data, a coordinator will be able to effectively match nurses with the services required and reduce driving time.",

        "abstract": "Audiodontics, Inc., under the support and cooperation of the University of Maryland, has recently developed a hearing aid called the Intraoral Audio Transducer System (IATS).  The IATS uses a miniature actuator of Terfenol-D coupled to a tooth to provide bone conduction sound.  Terfenol-D permits high power transduction with very low voltage and thus a safe system for installation inside the mouth.  In response to the Navy's requirement for improved underwater diver communication. a new application for Audiodontic's developed technology is proposed. Specific aims of the proposed program include: (1) Fabrication of a miniature Terfenol-D actuator which shall be embedded into a diver mouthpiece; (2) Standardization of the bone conduction hearing levels of prototype mouthpiece by sophisticated audiometric tests; (3) Testing the mouthpiece in divers underwater to demonstrate audible sound over a range of frequencies important for speech perception. Audiodontics intends to partner with Benthos, Inc., an underwater equipment specialist, to develop and commercialize the proposed technology.  While Benthos provides the experience and resources for commercialization, Audiodontics supplies the necessary commitment.",

Additional engineering will be required to demonstrate the feasibility of achieving an equivalent power to volume ration to reduce operating speeds.  This proposed Phase I effort would investigate the physical phenomena, equations, materials, and manufacturing techniques for our unique coaxial design to determine the feasibility of building an LMA with a power to volume ration of 20hp/ft3, capable of moving 13.75 inches at a no load rate of 7.3 inches per second, with a frequency response of 3 Hz, a maximum output force of 3,000 pounds, and a back drive force of less than 125 pounds at 1.0 inches per second.  After it has been proven feasible to design and build an LMA capable of meeting these requirements, a conceptual design of the actuator and its control system will be developed, based on an input voltage of 270 VDC.  The conceptual design will allow for basic parameters, other than the physical limitation of a 13.75 inch stroke, to be varied so that the design can be optimized. Preliminary heat generation calculations will be performed, and a heat rejection scheme will be developed for a maximum ambient temperature of 160 degrees F (71 C).  A work plan for Phase II will be developed, wherein a more in-depth analysis and design will be performed, and the LMA (including control system) will be fabricated and tested.",

In Phase I, feasibility will be demonstrated by 1) developing an NF membrane specifically for graywater treatment, 2) demonstrating the fouling resistance of the module, and 3) demonstrating the effectiveness of backflushing and other operating techniques to minimize fouling. An NF module will be operated on actual graywater generated on ships. In Phase IIF, development of the GTS will be completed and a prototype system will be delivered to the Navy for evaluation.",

A glycol dehydration unit operating on a 50-million SCFD naturalgas stream will typically discharge more than 40 tons per year of varioushazardous volatile organic air pollutants - about half of which is \"BTEX\"(benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes).Bend Research, Inc., proposes to develop a simple and efficient membrane-basedsystem that can be retrofited to the conventional vent condensers currently usedto reduce emissions from glycol dehydrators.  This process will be based on ahollow-fiber pervaporation module that enables the use of a unique system designthat eliminates the problematic wastewater stream produced by conventionalcondenser systems, while also recovering the BTEX.  In Phase I, they willfabricate small modules and operate them in a bench-scale apparatus.  A designbased on the results of these tests, as well as an economic assessment of thistechnology will provide the basis for a decision to proceed into the Phase IIprogram.

A system for measuring the actual resistance a wheelchair encounters when traveling over a given surface will be fabricated as a reference for the other devices. A wide range of surfaces will be measured with all of the devices, including varieties of indoor carpeting, concrete, dirt, gravel and sand. The data obtained with existing and proposed devices will be compared to the data obtained with the system for measuring surface resistance to wheelchair movement. The measuring device(s) which best correlate(s) with the resistance of a standard wheelchair on a variety of surfaces will be identified.

Benthos, Inc. proposes a development effort to replace the thruster technology, developed in the 1970s, currently in use on U.S. Navy undersea vehicles, with state-of-the-art thrusters based on this technology. Test prototype vehicles outfitted with thrusters incorporating this technology achieved outstanding thrust performance. Benthos proposes to apply this technology to thrusters which can inexpensively and readily be implemented on existing U.S. Navy assets. Benthos proposes a conservative, low risk, two-phase development program. A Phase I study will collect and evaluate data to determine an optimum design configuration, fully compatible with an existing vehicle. Phase I will include an anlysis of the performance improvements that can be expected when thrusters of this design are applied to the selected vehicles. Phase II includes the fabrication of prototype thruster assemblies and in-water testing to verify the predicted performance improvements. Prototype thrusters would be made availaable for further operational testing. It is anticitpated that the tooling used to produce the prototype thrusters during Phase II will be suitable for immediate use in Phase III production, allowing rapid phasing in to service of the fully developed high performance thrusters.",

The microfabricated sensor chips that are the heart of the technology will respond to volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The chips employ ultrasonic measuring principles that have been shown in previous university research to result in extremely high sensitivity; in the work we propose, new techniques will be developed for achieving concomitant selectivity. The use of a silicon technology gives promise of a low-cost manufacture. The chips will be the basis of portable sensor systems that can be used for on-site VOC pollutant monitoring. The technology is generic in the sense that it can be applied later to the detection of other types of pollutants. In this phase we will design and build a chemical identification chip incorporating an ultrasonic flexural-plate-wave sensor and other micro-machined elements. We will design and test circuitry and algorithms to control the individual chip elements in order to make a chemical-measurement system. System performance will be measured upon exposure to two different volatile organic compounds in the presence of water vapor.",

This technique creates 'Fractal-Like' complexity through the use of a mathematical equation that relies on a collection of fixed and random coefficients to the scene. Because the survivability of any TMD asset is greatly affected by the nature of its environment, there is a critical need for a way to simulate these effects in real time. Using the proposed technique, the Government will be able, for the first time, to render fully photo-realistic, real-time environments in its TMD simulations. The Result will be the generation of better simulations that allow valid survivability studies to be performed. This Phase I outlines a 6 month program to prove the viability of the ARMA technique for enhancing TMD simulations. This technique will revolutionize the way that DIS simulations are rendered and improve the validity of survivability studies using the DIS environment. The private sector will have many uses for this technology in the entertainment and video industry.",

        "abstract": "The poultry industry is dependent on efficient reproduction.  Reproduction of broiler lines increasingly is a problem and already is limiting for turkeys.  Currently, breeders or producers can identify males of low fertility only retrospectively after a costly failure.  However, elimination of the 25-35% of males likely to be of lowest fertility before they were turned in with hens would increase fertility by 10 percentage units.  Such culling presently is impossible because there is no simple, low cost test which is reasonably predictive of fertility of a rooster or turkey tom.  This project will develop an assay for field measurement of the combined attribute of sperm motility plus sperm binding to a substrate prepared from a purified extract from unfertilized chicken eggs.  The assay to be developed mimics, in vitro, the initial binding of a rooster spermatozoon to the vitelline membrane of an unfertilized hen's egg.  Early preliminary data demonstrate a strong relationship (r^2 = 0.81) between sperm binding to the microwell used for a prototype assay and fertility of the same semen.  Two Objectives will be addressed in Phase I.  Sperm from roosters of unknown fertility or from lines selected for high or low fertility will be used in 3 experiments with the goal of developing a repeatable and sensitivity fluorescent, microwell sperm-binding assay.  The 4th experiment will demonstrate feasiblity of the assay by showing, in a predictive manner, that roosters designated as \"bad\" or \"good\" on the basis of the newly developed assay differ in fertility and that, for a simulated population, sperm binding is predictive of fertility.",

Two amplification strategies are proposed based on their use of recognition sitesdistributed throughout the human genome at about 250 bp intervals (insuring representative coverageof genomic sequences in the min-library). The strategies are based on DNA sequence recognition byMbo I cleavage and by oligonucleotide hybridization to the most common 6 bp sequences in the humangenome. DNA products obtained from both strategies are PCR amplified with a single adaptoroligonucleotide. The products of the amplification reactions will be analyzed for the amount and sizeof DNA, degree of genome coverage, hybridization specificity, retrievability upon reamplification, easeof use and reproducibility. Based on amplification strategies developed in Phase I, we will ultimatelymake available to the human genom research community standardized reagents that can be used: a) forobtaining region-specific clones (i.e., genomic clones for contig assembly/map closure, and/or cDNAclones to identify novel genes), b) as starting material for isolation of region-specific STSs, and c) ashybridization/amplification targets for subchromosome localization.",

The performance characteristics of this technology have produced the highest specific peak power of any known battery technology, producing power levels in excess of 5000 Watts/kilogram (W/kg) and 16,000 Watts/liter (W/1). In addition, this unique Thin Metal Film technology has produced cells with the lowest internal impedance, for its size, of any known rechargeable battery technology using any chemistry. These cells are capable of being recharged to the 80% level in 3 minutes and fully recharded in approximately 10 minutes. This technology has been successfully demonstrated with small 1.5 Ah cells. The technical objective of the proposed project is to determine the optimum cell configuration, design and manufacturability requirements to scale this technology from a cell size of 1.5 Ah to 30 Ah. In accomplishing this, the basic chemistry utilizes the lowest cost raw materials of any rechargeable battery technology. In addition, all the materials are not just commonly recyclable, but are fully reusable within the battery industry.

        "abstract": "This proposal deals with the growth of a relatively new class of photorefractive semiconductor, Vanadium Doped ZnTe, which has fast response at relatively low intensity and high sensitivity required for real-time applications. Brimrose Corporation, in collaboration with the Center for Photonic Technology at The University of Southern California and Hughes Research Laboratories, Malibu, California, has in recent years produced ZnTe:V crystals and reported photorefractivity in this material for the first time. Our preliminary study indicates that ZnTe is an outstanding photorefractive material with a sensitivity range expanding from 0.6um to beyond 1.3um. Available ferroelectric oxides and sillenites do not have required efficient response beyond visible wavelengths. Moreover, these classes of materials lack the sensitivity and speed of response necessary for real time applications at low laser power levels. Semiconductors such as GaAs and CdTe are demonstrated to have a sensitive and fast response; however, their energy band gaps limit their use to wavelengths longer than 0.9um. The large band gap III-V and II-V semiconductors such as GaP, CdS, and ZnTe have the potential for sensitive operation in the wavelength range of O.57um to 1.3um. A comparison of the figures of merit n3r/Er, corresponding to the electro-optic index change per separated charges suggests the highest sensitivity in ZnTe. The superior sensitivity of ZnTe with respect to other materials is now confirmed through our preliminary experimental findings. During Phase I, the major emphasis will be placed on the purification of the starting material, determination of optimum doping concentration of vanadium for operation in the wavelength range of 0.8um to 0.85um and the growth of photorefractive ZnTe Crystals. The crystals will be grown by Physical Vapor Transport (PVT) technique which has already been standardized at Brimrose. The major emphasis will be on the growth of large crystals (at least 6mm to 8mm3) with the diffraction efficiencies better than 3%. The crystals grown using PVT will be characterized with respect to crystallographic defects as well as electrical and photorefractive properties. Sam",

The technique is closely related to the method of infrared imaging which employs an infrared video camera to detect temperature changes due to an expanding heat pulse. The technique being proposed will have greater resolution than infrared imaging due to the very high sensitivity of the holographic detection mechansim which will allow for the detection fine surface cracks. A further advantage of the Laser Holography Thermal Pulse Propagation (LHTPP) techcnique is that it can be used for all material systems including ferromagnetic, non ferromagnetic, insulators and conductors. In addition LHTPP readily lends itself to computer automation. Currently existing image analysis codes can be directly applied to the storage, enhancement and analysis of the holographic data. This will allow for the development of convenient field units for on site testing as well stationary laboratory setups.",

The system should handle both voice and data, should conform to the existing and future wireline protocols, could be easily reconfigured and should provide robust and secure means of communication in battlefield and in areas where wirelines do not exist. Conventional HF channel cannot support high data rate over sustained period of time. We propose to use short packets over many parallel paths and use adaptive control in real time. A major innovation is proposed for the efficient use of the HF channel using a novel \"intelligent node controller.\" This controller utilizes a physical model of the ionosphere and predicts the spatial and temporal variations of the ionospheric channel. The inverse channel transfer function derived from the model is used in an improved RAKE architecture. Utilization of multipath and multi-routing capabilities allow highly increased throughput and parallel control over these channels and are provided through the node controller. These features are integrated with the overall networking scheme. During Phase I we shall design the intelligent node controller which will significantly improve the throughput of the H.F. channel. Complete system will be built and demonstrated during Phase II. Anticipated Benefits: HF network could be a valuable extension of the Global-Grid concept. This would provide a cost-effective alternative in sparsely populated areas and in various sectors of DoD.

        "abstract": "In recent years, major advances have been made in nearly all areas of microelectronics development, including silicon technology, software development, and chip architecture. The one key area that has been more-or-less neglected however is packaging. The technology of packaging minature electronics such that they do not overheat is now the limiting factor in miniaturization. Experimental evaluation of the thermal management of Miniature Multi-Chip Modules (MCMs) and their board/system assemblies can be expensive and time consuming. A novel Virtual Prototyping Environment (VPE) for multi-scale thermal packaging and testing of MCMs and their assemblies is proposed.  It involves CAD technology, Virtual Parts Repository, grid generation, heat transfer and cooling media fluid mechanics solver, visualization tools, a thermal stresses module and Property Data Bank. It will allow rapid \"virtual assembly\" of chips, substrates, interconnects, and encapsulation components of MCM's and their thermal simulation, including thermal cycling and thermal stresses. An electronic component supplier, with the proposed VPE, could deliver a \"virtual chip: for system virtual integration before the hardware is shipped. In Phase I, the flow and heat transfer solver will be adapted and demonstrated for thermal packaging and thermal cycling testing of MCMs. A Virtual Parts Repository will be designed. Results of the Phase I effort and the VPE concept will be presented to SEMATECH, the U.S. electronic industry and academic Microelectronics Packaging Centers. Potential teaming/co-funding arrangements will be explored for Phases II and III. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS: The developed computational environment will help in design and thermal cycling testing of MCM's and MCM assemblies. The proposed Virtual parts Repository/Assembly will allow component suppliers to produce \"virtual chips\" before hardware is delivered for real assembly. The technology will be actively promoted in U.S. electronics, computer, automotive, telecommunication, and defense markets.",

        "abstract": "Surface pressure fluctuations due to turbulent flow over submerged bodies can cause vibration in the surface of the body which, in turn, may radiate noise.  In order to predict the structural vibrations responsible for the acoustic radiation, the wavenumber/frequency spectrum of the pressure fluctuations must be known. Experimental data and analytical methods to predict surface pressure spectra currently exist only for simple flows.  A computational tool is proposed here to predict surface pressure fluctuations in turbulent flow over practical flow configurations.  Large eddy simulation (LES) methodology will be developed and validated for multi-domain body- fitted curvilinear BFC grids in Phase I with particular emphasis given to the issue of filtering on BFC grids.  The LES methodology will be extended to hybrid (structured/unstructured) grids in Phase H. The Phase I study will demonstrate the feasibility of LES methodology with a finite volume formulation on BFC grids for predicting surface pressure fluctuations on simple flows.  The effect of grid skewness on accuracy of LES predictions will be assessed and recommendations will be made for further development and validation in Phase H. The Phase III study will compare the accuracy and computational requirements to calculate more complex flows with structured, unstructured, and hybrid grids.",

The resultant CFD code will be based on the solution of the full Navier-Stokes equations with advanced turbulence and combustion modeling and will utilize a rocket plume model for capturing the shape and characteristics of the ejection seat rocket plumes. In Phase I, a 2D axi-symmetric rocket plume model will be developed to investigate ejection seat rocket nozzle and plume flows and their effects on surrounding flow field.      Several techniques will be investigated for prescribing initial and boundary conditions within the three-dimensional ejection seat computational environment.  The rocket plume model will be validated against experimental data for   a wide range of free stream flow speeds.  Also in Phase I, the rocket plume model will be loosely incorporated into the ejection seat computational environment and a demonstration calculation will be made for an ejecting   seat with rocket power on. Several techniques for adaptive and/or local grid  refinement, controllable propulsion and multi-nozzle systems will be studied  for development/adaptation in Phase II. In Phase II, the rocket plume capability will be tightly incorporated into the ejection seat computational environment and the resultant CFD code will be extensively validated against wind Tunnel test data.

Data generated at Pratt & Whitney on an experimental prototype system will be used to develop, calibrate and validate endothermic chemistry model.  The chemistry model will be incorporated into an advanced Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code to facilitate the coupled analysis of fluid flow, heat/mass transfer and chemical reactions in fuel lines.  The coupled model will be used to perform detailed parametric studies to evaluate the performance of the cooling system over a range of operating conditions.  The parameters that will be studied in Phase I are the fuel flow rate, the heat load on the fuel, the operating temperature and the fuel/catalyst combination.  In Phase II, the model will be extended to include the effects of multi-component supercritical states and thermal pyrolysis of the fuel.",

The focus will be on subsystem contribution to pilot SA in the critical beyond-visual-range (BVR) to within-visual range (WVR) merge, and the goal will be to develop a quantitative computable metric which can be embedded in a large-scale engagement level model, such as the Man-in-the-Loop Air-to-Air System Performance Evaluation Model (MIL-AASPEM).  The proposed approach combines an integrated crew/system-model of pilot SA, with a pilot-centered metric that measures the disparity between the actual situation and the model-generated one.  The crew/system model formalizes the SA process and builds upon our earlier work in modeling pilot SA during the BVR phase.  It will make use of object-oriented software to facilitate later incorporation in MIL-AASPEM.

The approach combines empirical knowledge elicitation techniques and graphical model visualization tools in a structured methodology.

Graphical displays representing the mental models will be designed based on the data obtained from battlefield domain experts.  These displays will be embedded in an object-oriented interactive graphical user-interface system that will facilitate the rapid display and manipulation of these structures, including visualization of a given situation from multiple perspectives, at different points in time, and at varying levels of granularity and abstraction, to capture the types of flexible manipulation of these structures that expert decision makers are able to perform with their mental models.

For instance, the need to transmit video information from a vehicle for teleoperation greatly exceeds the current capability of military radios to transmit this information. The remote operator needs advanced video compression techniques to support low data rate and supervised driving modes which involve trading off bandwidth with temporal lag, image resolution, and frame update rate. This proposal advocates the development of an approach to control interface design based on operator focus of attention modeling. Our approach is to enhance early man-machine interface (MMI) definition through a virtual reality environment for UGV control which supports implementation of a rapid succession of prototype user control interfaces. These MMIs inherently incorporate metering, i.e. quantitative measurement of operator performance for benchmark mission activities. The overall approach leverages the current art in constructing virtual reality systems and new technology in human operator response metering developed at Cybernet (for DARPA). Also work now underway at Cybernet to develop an advanced multiple vehicle operator control station for DEMO II provides an ideal path for technology migration into main line US Army UGV program activities later.",

Medical studies indicates that Beta-carotene is preventative and sometimes terapeutic against malignant tumors, lung cancer, colon cancer, esophagus cancer, and skin cancer.\n\nIt is the focus of this proposal to develop a new separation process for recovery of natural carotene from carotene-containing vegetable oils such as palm oil.  Conventional methods for this separation include liquid/liquid extraction, liquid chromatography, and packed-bed adsorption.  Conventional liquid/liquid extraction is undesirable because of the tendency to form stable emulsions--leading to loss of solvents and expensive waste treatment.  Chromatography and packed-bed processes have problems of bed compression and high pressure drops.  The process that we propose to develop utilizes a highly selective carotene-complexing agent in a membrane-extraction process.  This process promises to be superior to conventional technology because it allows emulsion-free liquid/liquid extraction.  In addition, the proprietary complexing agent promises to have very high selectivity and capacity for this separation.  In Phase I our goal is to demonstrate the feasibility of the novel approach for recovery of natural carotene from palm oil.  We will characterize the process with respect to operating variables, and we will produce sufficient natural carotene from palm oil to allow extensive chemical testing.",

EVITA builds on earlier research performed by the proposed principal investigator and research team which demonstrated the feasibility of versatile discrete and continuous control by combining eye-control and voice-control techniques, and with feedback and filtering employed for the eye-control channel. EVITA addresses the extension of the previous eye-voice interface research into the the three-dimensional graphic environment, addition of dynamic user-controlled recalibration to achieve consistent pointing accuracy, and of generating modular, standardized software components in order to make the EVITA interface readily adaptable to a maximum diversity of UNIX-based applications. In the proposed Phase I effort, a complete design for an EVITA interface will be produced and implemented in an experimental testbed. Alternative methods for providing interaction with the third spatial dimension (depth) will be developed along with alternative techniques for making menu selection; experiments will be designed and conducted in Phase I to guide the selection between these alternatives.",

HINTS will enable the aircrew to obtain data on intermediate analyses and sensor data summaries in order to aid in the verification and interpretation of the original alerts.

        "abstract": "We will use two approaches to produce new near infrared (nir) dyes for use as fluorescent probes for biological sensing.  The first approach will build on the experience of the laboratory of Dr. Leslie Loew in the development of fluorescent dyes based on the aminostyryl pyridinium chromophore and its analogs.  These dyes have extraordinary Stokes shifts and, when bound to biological macromolecules or molecular assemblies, high quantum yields.  The second approach exploits the newly emerging technology revolving around luminescent lanthanide chelates and cryptates.  These compounds employ energy transfer between the ligand and the metal ion which then emits a nir photon with a long (0.1 to 10 ms) luminescence lifetime, making them ideal for time-gated detection schemes.  All new dyes will be fully characterized by mass spectroscopy, nmr and elemental analysis.  Also, absorbance and emission spectra, fluorescence quantum efficiencies and fluorescence lifetimes will be measured.  Because near infrared light is becoming readily and cheaply available through new diode laser and led technologies, is less destructive to tissue, has better penetrating ability and is less subject to interference from background light, these compounds will be of tremendous utility in conjunction with new micro fluorescence detection modalities being developed by Ciencia and elsewhere.",

Proliferation of smooth muscle cells at inappropriatelocations within the lumens of arteries plays a major role in the pathology of atherosclerosis.

A new Total Veriation based, feature-accurate approach to basic image processing tasks has been developed by Cognitech researchers.  These image processing tasks include video restoration, frame matching, expansion, sharpening, and image measurements.  Numerical instability is overcome by computing solutions of time-dependent, nonlinear PDE's with or without degradation constraints.  Moreover, TV based image processing delivers accurate estimation of singularities, i.e. computed image features are a numerically accurate approximation of true image features.  Only when the accuracy of all singular image features is assured can an algorithm be used as a serious investigation tool for identification of subjects within the surveillance video.  Real life surveillance videos are low resolution, noisy, and blurry.  The subject to be identified may be captured by only a small pixel area on each video field.  We are proposing an analytic and nonlinear PDE-based fast computational discrete technique for \"frame fusion\", which is multiscale, accurate, and occlusion capturing.  This technique will incorporate video degradations such as motion, out-of-focus atmospheric blurs, as well as recording noise and distortions.",

The unique design of this laser allows production of a greater range of pulse widths and energies than was previously obtainable from a single source.

SSRS provides an alternative to using 1.064 um Nd:YAG lasers with gaseous D2 Raman shifters.  Important differences between SSRS and OPO's include the fact that SSRS devices do not require phase matching, have no acceptance product design margins, can have high quantum efficiencies, do not require the use of high quality pump beams to obtain efficient, diffraction limited output.  In this proposed effort, we will develop efficient SSRS transmitter source suitable for both direct and coherent detection-mode lidars (a \"dual-mode\" lidar).  Phase I of the program demonstrates frequency control of the SSRS system via injection seeding.  Dual-detection mode lidars provide a means of optimizing system sensitivity in changing scenarios.

COI's SNAPSAT (TM) technology has demonstrated that polymer composites structural components can be as affordable as existing aluminum structural components (i.e., FORTE's bus structures).  If successful, this technology would show the feasibility to design and fabricate spacecraft electronic housings and heat sinks for PWB's that:  1.  Reduce their mass by 40-50% (compared to aluminum).  2.  Are thermally compatible with the future composite spacecraft bus and mounting decks and therefore can be incorporated into the structure itself (i.e., multi-functional structure).  3.

Combining thesemodules with existing vacuum pumps and batteries, we can supply 5 liters/minute of OEA from an eightpound system. This OEA is humidified, which patients value.

We will develop and validate state-of-the-art HEMTs and HBTs models and combine them into our commercially available linear, nonlinear circuit simulator, microwave Harmonica(Tm). We have already developed physics-based models to predict linear and bias dependent performance of millimeter-wave AlGaAS/GaAs HEMTS. During the Phase I, we will extend our models to InAlAs/InGaAs/InP HEMTs and HBTs to accurately predict the device DC, linear and non-linear microwave performances including device output power and ldB compression point, third order intercept point, and essentially predict large- signal performance. The Phase II of the proposed program focuses on detailed experimental verification of the developed models and generation and integration of modeling tools to our circuit simulator, leading to full commercialization of Microwave HarmonicaTm. The successful outcome of this program will result in major strides being made in quality, usefulness and maturity of our CAD tools especially related to cost-effective realization of of InP-based devices and MMICS. Anticipated Benefits: The CAD enhancements resulting from this effort will be of immediate use to GaAs and InP MMIC device and circuit designers. Since no other CAD vendor offers such a tool, we anticipate product distribution in excess of 10,000 units world wide within the completion of Phase II program.",

The Lie group model of cortical visual information processing is a dynamical system. The neural geometric engine equipped with Lie germs is capable of computing Lie derivatives of imagery by linear filtering, and further determining affine differences of two images in a dynamical system. The full development of a Lie group model neural geometric engine will solve the geometric transform problem in realtime and will have very extensive applications in the area of imaging sensor data processing and will have great impact to artificial vision. Successful development of artificial neural geometric information processing system will make possible for quick terrain scene visualization from raw satellite and aerial photographs.

        "abstract": "COMCO proposes to develop a new, meshless computational methodology for dynamic fracture simulation in fluid-structural interaction.  Our approach is based on a new class of methods which eliminate all need for computational mesh of finite elements.  This is accomplished by covering the computational domain by a cloud of points and using these points for discretiz- ation of the mathematical problem.  We will introduce h-andp-adaptivity, where new points will be adaptively added and removed in the domain, and the local order of approximation will be adaptively selected to assure high accuracy of approximation near the crack tip. This new approach will eliminate classical restrictions on modeling of crack propagation imposed by the finite element methods, where cracks can only propagate along element boundaries.  Moreover, by introducing adaptiv- ity, it will allow for accurate resolution of stress around the crack tip and tracking of crack propagation.  Importantly, the method will allow for a high degree of parallelization on MPP machines. In Phase I we will extend the meshless computational capabilities exist- ing at COMCO to hp-adaptive modeling of crack propagation problems in two- dimensional domains.  We will explore and compare various methods of meshless discretization, and select an approach optimal for fracture problems.  Also, we will develop a research-type code and allow for coupling with existing hydrodynamic software used for prediction of dynamic loading.  We will perform relevant numerical computations to demonstrate viability of the new technology.  The results of Phase I will be a basis for the Phase II effort, which will extend these capabilties to three-dimensional problems (including shells), full dynamic solutions, large-scale problems and various types of crack propagation criteria.",

The revolution in microprocessor and microchip technology that has occurred since the present algorithm  was designed allows much more sophistication to be incorporated in an improved version.  For Phase I, we propose to produce a preliminary design of a algorithm based on the Global Theoretical Ionospheric Model (GTIM) developed at Phillips Laboratory (Geophysics Directorate).  It will be designed to fit in a single Programmable Read-Only Memory (PROM) chip.  It will also be designed to be backward compatible with the present algorithm and to require little or no additional telemetry so that the impact on GPS operations will be minimal while providing the maximum benefit to the user.

        "abstract": "The free-space characterization of an anechoic chamber is presently accomplished by conducting difficult and tedious RF measurements of the interference field intensity levels. Anechoic chambers are characterized after initial construction to determine the quiet zones where the creation of free-space conditions is being attempted. When systems under test (SUT) are placed in the chamber, degradation of the quiet zone occurs and generally characterization of the chamber must be re-accomplished. Chamber characterization with the SUT is usually the most time-consuming and a very costly part of the test activities in anechoic chamber facilities.  This Phase I proposal is to determine the feasibility of developing an accurate computer software model to simulate and predict the RF environment of anechoic chambers. The analytical tool will have capability which has application for characterization of any anechoic chambers containing any size SUT. The proposed solution takes advantage of an in-being Airborne Antenna Pattern Prediction Program (A2P3) desktop workstation to provide the required capability. With integration of other codes which provides accurate scattering models for the chamber anechoic surfaces, an enhanced A2P3 will provide an all digital model measurement tool to characterize the noise level, locate quiet zones, and hot spots in large anechoic chambers with or without SUT installed. This capability will greatly enhance anechoic chamber testing by accomplishing characterization with greater accuracy, automating characterization tests, and substantially reducing the overall characterization time and cost. The proposed approach allows the characterization tasks to be accomplished on a user-oriented workstation by test engineers without extensive knowledge of RF measurements techniques or the inter-working of the various codes utilized in the all digital characterization models. The resulting Test Mode Anechoic Chamber Characterization Analysis Tool will be an invaluable, cost-effective asset to support anechoic chamber testing activities.",

Implementation of a standard multispectral environment will provide tremendous cost savings to any agency which engages in M&S activity involving some type of environmental phenomenology.  The development of a standard multispectral environment must:  1) be performed from a \"big picture\" or integrated point of view; 2) be user configurable; 3) be scalable from lesser to more detailed granularity; 4) be distributable; and 5) contain a common geographic referencing system.  This common geographic referencing system should be capable of supporting the simulation configuration, execution and post-processing modes.

There is great potential in using reliably measured OAE to provide a quick, inexpensive and non-intrusive assessment of hearing functional levels and detection of early temporal damage to the hearing function.  To further explore this potential, an advanced fuzzy logic filtering technique based OAE measurement approach will be investigated in this study.  Recent advances in fizzy logic have provided new filtering techniques that integrate inexact human experts and rigorous mathematical filters to handle noise and uncertainties.  Specifically, hierarchial fizzy logic and weighted majority minimum range based filtering techniques will be investigated and applied to obtain genuine OAE signals from the measured biological signals which are usually accompanied with noise and other artifacts.  Utilizing hierarchical fuzzy logic will add more flexibility both in integrating human experts with non-fuzzy filters and in using such non-fuzzy filters themselves.

        "abstract": "Laser polarimetric/ellipsometric methods have been employed in our laboratory for the measurement of the normal spectral emissivities of solid and liquid materials at elevated temperatures.  In this approach, a polarized light source is incident on the surface of interest at oblique incidence, and the reflected polarization state is measured in about 0.5 ms.  The optical properties of the surface, including athe normal spectral emissivity are then derived.  Recently, we have developed a laser polarimetric appartus using this approach and have achieved 1-3% accuracy in emissivity measurements on solid and liquid materials pulseheated over a 0.5 s time period.  These successful efforts form the basis of this proposal which seeks to extend the laser polarimetric approach to be capable of 1 MHz measurement bandwidth for application to very rapid pulse-heating experiments which last 50-100 us.  The Phase I work will be aimed at establishing:  (i) detector and electronics capable of 10 MHz bandwidth, (ii) design of the optics to accommodate specimen motion which occurs during the rapid pulse, (iii) methods to eliminate or minimize the incandescent background from interfering with the laser signal, (iv) methods to accurately measure the magnitude of the laser signal, and (v) testing of the proposed methods at the pulse-heating facility.  These key design problems will be investigated, both analytically and experimentally during the Phase I effort.  During Phase II, a prototype instrument will be constructed and delivered to NIST for experimentation on pulse-heated materials.",

        "abstract": "Control of trailing vortex wakes is an important challenge for both military and civilian applications. Ingestion of concentrated vortices in propellers can lead to undesirable noise in submarines, while the encounter of aircraft wakes with following aircraft presents a significant safety hazard that limits capacity at all major U.S. airports. This proposal involves an assessment of the feasibility of mitigating adverse vortex wake effects using aero- and hydrodynamic control surfaces actuated via smart structures technology. This will involve a combined computational/ design analysis effort focused on identifying changes in the spatial and temporal load distribution on lifting surfaces to promote vortex breakdown and other destructive instabilities that can deintensify the vortex wakes of aircraft and submarines. The computational analysis will apply proven tools in a study of the sensitivity of core structure and vortex wake hazard to modifications of the trailing vortex wake, while the design studies will build on modeling tools recently developed for the analysis of aerodynamic surfaces actuated using smart materials. The overall objective will be the identification of a technically feasible system using deflectable surfaces that can address current challenges in vortex wake deintensification through the promotion of altered wake structure. Anticipated Benefits: Vortex wake hazard drives aircraft landing separation at major airports and the delays resulting from excessive spacing cost the US economy several billion dollars annually in lost time and jet fuel. Even relatively modest reductions in current spacing would substantially increase effective airport capacity. In addition, wake alleviation for submarines would help protect the investment in the current fleet of low-noise underwater vehicles.",

        "abstract": "Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Lasers (VCSEL) offer unique optical and electrical characteristics including single mode operation, low power requirements, low beam divergence, circular beam shape and 2D configurability. As in any semiconductor laser these lasers lack temporal and spatial uniformity in wavelength for most present application. With the fast growing interest and development of applications utilizing VCSELs however it is becoming clear that there is a need for precise control of the laser wavelenth, either for \"agile\" wavelength tuning or fixed-wavelength applications. CoreTek, Inc. proposes a monolithic technology in which tuning is achieved through on-chip integration of an electro-optic layer coupled with a novel mirror design. Our integrated optic approach to tunable VCSELs allow electronic single-mode tuning up to 100nm throughout the wavelengths of GaAlAs/InGaAs (0.70-1.1um) and InGaAsP (1.0u-1.5um) lasers while yielding a narrow linewidth of >1A. As such, this method can be used not only to achieve \"agile\" wavelength tuning, but also for eliminating the wavelength drift problem by steady-state tuning. Phase I will demonstrate the feasibility of the concept by developing an electro-optic thin film cavity and to demonstrate the electronic tuning. Phase II will be devoted to the development of optimal tunable VECSELs devices in terms of reliability, low cost fabrication and initial commercialization efforts. Tunable diode lasers will enable high bandwidth telecommunication industry, high density optical storage technologies, remote sensing for the military and environmental applications, toxic waste monitoring, mining applications.

Until recently, the majority of spacecraft data storage requirements were provided by tape recorders.  In 1989, however, a new era in spacecraft data storage began when SEAKR Engineering developed the first production Solid State Recorder (SSR).  The on-orbit success of this and subsequent SEAKR SSRs has enabled the industry to switch from failure-prone tape recorders to more reliable SSRs.  Earlier versions of these SSRs were designed as simple tape recorder replacements.  Advances in architecture pioneered by SEAKR have allowed the latest spacecraft SSRs to connect to multiple hosts, simultaneously perform random read and write operations, survive multiple hard and soft memory failures, and autonomously map out defective memory.  Future spacecraft instruments are being designed that will generate TeraBytes of information at Gbps data rates. The next generation SSRs must have much higher capacity and data rates based upon denser memory structures and a more flexible, multi-user architecture.  This program will develop this future SSR architecture technology with emphasis on increasing the data flow rate and decreasing the physical size of the memory support circuits.",

        "abstract": "Recent technological advancements in the growth of bulk single crystal, ternary, III-V alloys strongly indicate the potential for commercial feasibility of these alloy substrates.  Commercial availability will permit realization of the concept of substrate engineering.  Based on reported developments in the (In,Ga)As and (In,Ga)Sb ternary systems, we propose to develop a materials technology for the single crystal growth of InP1-xAsx' to x = 0.4, commensurate with proposed optoelectronic device applications in this materials system.  The innovations are: 1) application of novel crystal growth techniques by which the alloy composition, \"x\" value, is increased by \"bootstrapping\" onto lattice matched seeds and 2) incorporation of ternary seeds with a growth technology to minimize computational variations which normally occur.  In Phase I, we will determine computational and electrical characteristics, develop a wafer fabrication methodology and evaluate crystal quality.  Wafers will be provided to Sensors Unlimited (Dr Gregory Olsen-Consultant) who will fabricate and test p/n junction photodetectors.  In Phase II we will extend the composition to x = 0.4 and develop techniques to grow crystals in the (100) direction of highly uniform composition.  Substrates for fabrication of 2.5um photodetector arrays and strained layer lasers will be provided Sensors Unlimited.",

        "abstract": "Intelligent materials open new avenues to improve performance, reliability and longevity of future aerospace vehicle structures by allowing the structural materials themselves to become active elements for multiple system functions. However, the application of intelligent materials and structures has been inhibited because the effects of microstructural interactions between intelligent and host material elements have not yet been well characterized. The objective of the proposed research is to develop predictive models of these local phenomena to enable analytical assessment of their effects on material and structural integrity. The research plan involves: (1) extension of existing micromechanical models of composite material behavior to include descriptions of intelligent material elements, (2) development of new models to assess the geometrically nonlinear effects of embedded elements in composite material systems, (3) application of numerical models of crack propagation behavior to predict growth of damage in intelligent composites, and (4) design of experiments to validate the analytical models and to further explore damage propagation in intelligent material systems. The analytical models developed under this effort will be implemented in widely used software systems (e.g. Mathermatics, NASTRAN).",

With availability of high-speed optical sources and photodetectors, the focus is now in development of an integrated opto-electronic circuit which would be small in size and low power consuming. Standard clock recovery circuits based on the sample and hold, analog or digital phase lock loops require complicated and high power consuming circuits. The purpose of this proposal is introduction and demonstration of a new approach to design of optical receiver and clock recovery systems. Particularly, a technique based on the push-pull oscillator that is frequency and phase synchronized to the input data signal using injection locked phase lock loop scheme is advocated.

        "abstract": "The proposal describes a method for developing a dynamic simulation model of aircraft life cycle aging and obsolescence.  The model will assist USAF program managers in identifying and quantifying life extension options for aging aircraft.  The model can capture, in as much detail as described, each of the critical systems and components within an aircraft or system and track their aging and obsolescence over time.  For each system, the model will compute performance deterioration as well.  Periodic maintenance and refitting will reset model parameters to reflect increased performance levels.  USAF program managers will be able to test a variety of operational \"what-if?\" scenarios in order to discover the optimal choices that best meet mission requirements and, at the same time, satisfies both short-term and long-term budget constraints. Model output will provide cost and performance curves as well as the present value of cumulative costs for alternative acquisition and maintenance policies for aircraft systems.",

A false target generator has the potential to saturate or tie up an enemies air defense net and increase survivability of our own airborne assets. An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is an optimum candidate for a decoy payload in support of a Suppression of Enemy Air Defense (SEAD) mission. The primary technical objective is to design an electronic decoy UAV payload capable of simulating multiple false targets that exhibit sufficient fidelity to deceive sophisticated radars. The phase I research and design effort will result in established perfomance requirements and a preliminary design of the electronic decoy payload. The design will be modeled to study its performance against a variety of threat emitters. Tradeoffs will be studied by means of qualified results from computer analysis and simulation. The design will be modified according to data obtained and lessons learned from the simulation. The final phase I design will be the basis for development of a brassboard demonstration model in phase II. The brassboard system will undergo extensive laboratory testing and mock-up testing. The phase II design will be modeled as in phase I, but will also be \"flown\" in dynamic engagement scenarios in the Lockheed Sanders Modeling Laboratory.",

The complexity of today's EW systems require non-intrusive instrumentation for their development.  This instrumentation must operate on a real-time basis so that the development/evaluation objectives can be achieved in a cost-effective manner in order to meet stringent real-time requirements.  This SBIR will develop a preliminary design and implementation approach for non-intrusive instrumentation for extracting Electronic Combat (EC) environmental effects on Electronic Warfare (EW) systems. Facilities such as IDAL can stimulate EW systems for laboratory testing but has limited capability for extracting resulting effects in a non-intrusive manner.  The IDAL is an excellent example of a facility that requires real-time non-intrusive instrumentation because they must work with state-of-the-art integrated avionics which share resources and data.  The shared resources and data is the key enabling technology for future systems.  Trouble shooting these systems is another key requirement that must be performed on a real-time non-intrusive basis.  The key technical challenge is non-intrusive testing. Conventional methods of real-time instrumentation for complex EW systems that utilize shared resources and data often corrupt the data recorded and effect the systems operation providing bad test results.",

        "abstract": "The Phase I technical objective is to design a series of small receiving antennas which operate in the HF, VHF, and UHF frequency ranges (approximately 1 MHz to 1500 MHz) and then to build and test prototypes of the designs. The antennas are physically small in size and man-packable. Conventional antenna design approaches have constraints which can result in physically large structures, especially in the HF frequency band. Tradeoffs between size and electrical performance are required to develope small antennas. Analysis of the most prevalent RF environment in the frequency bands of interest will be necessary to allow optimizing the antenna size and performance tradeoff, and in general to minimize the amount of hardware required to provide acceptable performance. Delfin Systems has extensive experience in the design and simulation of small, portable antennas, as well as communications system analysis and design. Many Delfin Systems products use optimized, small, lightweight antennas. The designs requiring external power sources have been optimized for extremely low power consumption. Delfin Systems is unique in that it has developed significant expertise in the smooth transition from computer modeling of antenna designs to successful implementation in hardware. The antennas developed in the work are universal, and are capable of working with all common existing equipment. Interfaces to equipment are therefore to be as universal as possible, and modification of existing equipment is not required. The antennas physical configuration can be used in a wide variety of mounting scenarios with minimum installation time and effort. The proposed antennas offer the best tradeoff between physical constraints and desirable electrical properties, and their use or inclusion in existing systems or operational scenarios, requires a minimum of effort and retraining of the user. These small antennas offer appreciable advantages over existing antenna schemes.",

It is therefore necessary to simulate the operation of these missing components and to stimulate the existing interfaces with realistic and repeatable sensor and control data. This interface simulation is also necessary for training of operators, where tactical situations must be simulated in order to provide realistic training scenarios. The objective of this proposed Phase I effort is twofold. First, the requirements for combat system simulation/stimulation will be identified and a simulation/stimulation architecture that meets these requirements will be defined. This architecture will take maximum advantage of the Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS), Open System Architecture (OSA) components that are planned for the implementation of new combat systems and will be implemented by migration of existing simulation software, where possible. Secondly, a prototype subset of a combat system will be proposed for use as a test facility to verify the capabilities of the architecture. An optional task is proposed, which will result in a Phase 11 plan that covers specific configurations and test requirements.",

        "abstract": "A solution to the problem of interchip interconnects is proposed that employs electro-optical links implemented monolithically on silicon substrates.  This approach addresses the fundamental material incompatibility problem of opto-electronics by implementing electronics in silicon and optical components using III-V compounds on a single chip.  This is made possible through the use of \"selective epitaxy\", a technique that Discovery Semi- conductors has developed to grow device grade InGaAs-on-silicon substrates.  Growth of InGaAs crystals on a lattice mismatched substrate is improved by limiting the growth area, selecting appropriately oriented wafers, and controlling the growth conditions.  Dr. Eugene Fitzgerald of M.I.T., who pioneered selective epitaxy, will consult.  This capability will be used to grow dual function, infrared In0.53Ga0.47As p-i-n photodiode/light emitting diode structures operating at 1100 to 1600 nm on a silicon CMOS circuit.  These devices can be used to form optical links between separate seminconductor chips.  A simple, proximity focussed architecture is presented where multiple silicon chips are stacked together.  The optical emitter/detector pairs then form the links between the layers of the stack.  A device that has all the components required to implement this scheme is proposed for the Phase I work.  A more elaborate multi-plane, optically coupled, massively parallel processor is anticipated for development in Phase II.",

This concept uses a self supporting 360 degrees rotating shroud ring with an interference shrink fit between the shroud ring and the blade tip.  The radial deflection of the ring and blade tip are nearly matched and the ring provides a positive clamp force at all steady-state and transient operating conditions.

        "abstract": "Cement-bonded particleboard is an environmentally safe high-performance reconstituted wood product with desirable longevity, fire resistance and life-cycle cost position, presenting a great potential to maintain the competitive position of reconstituted wood boards in demanding construction markets.  The low productivity of cement-bonded particleboard plants and the inhibitory effects of some wood species resulting from the slow setting and hardening of cement have led to relatively high initial costs.  Early exposure of cement binders to carbon dioxide can substantially reduce the setting and hardening times.  Industrial-scale implementation of the carbonation technology, however, has been hindered by the difficulties in achieving uniform carbonation effects and controlling the rate of carbonation reactions, and also by the high cost and unavailability of CO2 in large volumes.  In order to overcome these obstacles, we propose to replace pure CO2 with a blend of CO2 and air, and eventually with CO2-enriched exhaust gases which are readily available at low cost and are responsible for the greenhouse effect.  We have hypothesized that the air content of the exhaust gas opens channels into the board for thorough penetration of CO2, and also helps control the rate of reactions to make industrial-scale implementations more practical.  Phase I research will determine the CO2 concentration and vacuum/gassing regime best suiting the production of particleboard.  We will also evaluate various exhaust gases for introduction into the process, and will assess the commercial viability of the new approach to carbonation.",

In the proposed Phase I effort technical feasibility of the modeling approach shall be proven by development of a thermal model to compute contact temperatures in ball, cylindrical and tapered roller bearings, implementation of the model into existing bering dynamics computer codes, and by carrying out parametric studies to demonstrate a relationship between contact temperatures and applied operating conditions with prescribed bearing geometry.  A more extensive development, where changes in bulk temperatures, resulting thermal distortion and changes in bearing geometry, closer integration of the thermal and contact mechanics models, modeling of thermally induced instabilities in bearing element motion, and integrated computer codes for bearing design and performance diagnosis, shall be the subjects of technical development in Phase II.  It is anticipated that the enhanced bearing dynamics computer codes will provide immediate technology transfer for bearing design and performance diagnosis.

In military operations, the variabilities are further magnified by the mobility of the network nodes and the highly unpredictable, often bursty, nature of the traffic.  The proposed protocols will consist of a hierarchial topology establishment/maintenance protocol and an adaptive routing control protocol.  The topology protocol accommodates the slowly changing network propagation conditions, and the routing protocol accommodates the bursty, highly variable traffic from the network subscribers, as well as the effects of sudden propagation disturbances.",

        "abstract": "The widespread occurrence of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the environment requires a comprehensive assessment of their environmental impact. This assessment is made substantially more difficult because the PCBs are a mixture of 209 possible chloro-isomers; the most common mixtures may not represent the most significant toxic or biologically active components. Consequently, there is growing recognition that the congener specific analysis of PCBs in the environment is required for the evaluation of the PCBs environmental impact. However, the effort and expense associated with the analysis of these compounds by capillary gas chromatography place substantial restraints on the required studies. Immunoassay based analytical methods have demonstrated the ability to provide both high throughput screening and quantitative analyses. This method provides for a marked reduction in both sample preparation due to high specificity and instrumentation requirements due to assay simplicity. This project will build on ECOCHEM's successful development of a sensitive and quantitative Aroclor directed PCB immunoassay to develop a toxic/ biologically active congener relevant assay for both sample screening and congener specific analysis.",

A paint system typically comprises of an underlying primer and a topcoat with the primer containing pigments that act as corrosion inhibitors.  The most successful inhibitors in aircraft paints are the chromates (e.g., zinc yellow or strontium chromate).  Since chromate corrosion inhibitors represent a significant environmental and health liability, more environmentally benign inhibitors are required. We propose a new class of corrosion inhibitors based on reduction-oxidation (redox) active, electrically conductive oxides.  When galvanically coupled to a metal, they will maintain the mixed potential of the couple within the passive range of the metal preventing active corrosion. Unlike conventional chromate inhibitors, these metal oxides autocatalytically reduce 02 or H2O allowing them to sustain anodic protection without themselves discharging to active potentials or being consumed in the films (probably ",

With zero current and voltage switching, it will high modulation frequency (over 30 khz), thus driving a motor silently and efficiently throughout the speed range. The USRC produces any waveform required by any type of EV motor. It produces clean sinusoidal voltages, thus liminating induction motor overrating, noise and losses due to harmonics. The USRC can also receive any type of power, such as DC from batteries and AC from an engine generator, without any hardware change or need for other conversion or interface hardware. Finally, due to the use of high frequency modulation and the elimination of external filters, the USRC drive will be smaller and less costly than alternatives. Due to the USRC's extraordinary conversion flexibility, it can also become the heart of the entire electrical system of the EV. Without other conversion or interface hardware, it can link together the prime source (engine generator), storage (batteries or flywheels), propulsion motor and auxiliary loads (lights, wipers), in spite of highly disparate types of power. For example, a battery charger would not be necessary. Anticipated Benefits: In addition to the benefits described above, the resulting designs and technologies can be used by industry and the government in the following applications: variable-speed drives and actuators, variable-speed generation systems, inverters for photovoltaic cells, fuel cells and batteries, frequency changers, uninterruptible power supplies and power conditioners.",

Certain advanced munitions will require that these warheads and their initiators survive high-g impact and target penetration events without degradation of function.  All will, of course, have to survive and operate in the full spectrum of the military storage and operating environment.  Meeting these challenges will require the development of a new packaging and interconnection technique which provides maximum flexibility to the warhead design while still meeting the military environments and the tough functional challenges of the advanced initiator application.  The results of these efforts will provide a higher efficiency energy transfer allowing the use of lower power and/or smaller size systems for commercial and military use in other products.  A key element of these future system is the design of appropriate connectors.  The proposed program is for the development of an ultralow impedance high voltage connector.   The program focuses on EFIs, both the conventional copper-clad polyimide systems and the more advanced, thin-film, deposited-bridge \"chip\" types.  It includes the definition of requirements, tradeoff analyses, and breadboard evaluation of a preliminary design.

Proposed fiber optic chemical sensor technology relies upon the reversible chemical bleaching of selected immobilized triphenylmethane dyes.  Hydrazine related vapors (UDMH, MMH and H) will react with the central carbon of triphenylmethane dyes reversibly forming Lewis acid-base abducts.  Formation of these abducts will result in chemical bleaching of initially intensely colored dyes to give, upon complete saturation, colorless intermediates.  Subsequent removal of hydrazine related species will shift the equilibrium back to the free triphenylmethane dye coated optical fibers will induce an optical change in both the dye and at the dye-optical fiber interface.

The fiber diameter, length, packing fraction and surface treatment are adjusted for maximum bond effectiveness corresponding to a given grain distribution and binder composition. Proposed electrostatic fiber placement and resertion methods are suited for large scale use. The proposed bondline reinforcement concept potentially results in a simpler motor assembly process, as well as lighter and more reliable propellant castings. Phase I effort involves initial coupon peel testing from which promising configurations will be selected for evaluation using the blister test method with 12\" specimens. Candidate fiber attachment and insertion methods will be evaluated. ESLI carbon fiber electroflocking and fiber implantation will be tailored for use with rocket insulation materials. Test results will be interpreted in terms of a preliminary model that accounts for fiber type. Fiber distribution and interfacial adhesion properties. Phase 2 would further develop processes conducive to cost-effective assembly of high-reliability solid rocket motors.",

In Phase I, we will begin to model the behavior of these explosives based on a new physical model of the fundamental reaction processes and on the most current scientific understanding of the physical behavior of the solid and fluid components of explosives during and subsequent to the reaction processes.  Model development will be completed in Phase II, incorporated into a hydrodynamics code, and validated against the known behavior of three explosives, each in a different class; one ideal, one nonideal, and one in a separate class which we define as totally nonideal.  In the latter class, fuel and oxidizer are separated, being in different grains of the composite explosive.  Once this task is completed, behavioral predictions will be made for cases not reported in the experimental data base.  In this way the predictive code can be verified as truly predictive by subsequent experiments.  In Phase I all the physical data, and much of the analysis necessary for the construction and implementation of the code will be detailed.  In this Phase, three explosives will be selected and everything necessary for their modeling in the hydrocode will be presented.  In Phase II, three practical applications to military and industrial problems will be made. Here existing explosives will be tailored in their composition to maximize desirable explosive effects.  In addition, it will be possible to predict the behavior of entirely new explosive compositions, thus providing a rationale for the development of promising explosive types.",

        "abstract": "Essential Research, Inc. proposes to build a thermophotovoltaic (TPV) electric generator using a solar concentrator heat source with thermal storage capability, a selective emitter, and a photovoltaic cell. The operation point of the heat source and selective emitter will be approximately 1700K. The moderate operating temperature was chosen to provide a system energy conversion efficiency of greater than 20% and the high reliability required for military operations. The heat source is a solar concentrator dish developed by McDonnell Douglas Aerospace. The selective emitter will be a single or polycrystalline host material (such as garnet) doped with rare-earth oxides. A narrow band gap photovoltaic cell will be fabricated by the organo-metallic vapor phase epitaxy (OMVPE) deposition of InGaAs on InP substrates. The bandgap of the photovoltaic cell will be tailored to optimize the conversion of the selective emitter spectra, even though this will result in a lattice mismatch between the film and the substrate. The defects generated by the mismatch will be passivated with hydrogen to optimize the electrical properties of the photovoltaic cell. We believe that this technology will provide excellent conversion efficiencies in a commercially viable process. At the end of Phase I, we will demonstrate this technology by developing an emitter/cell combination (a converter) having a 15% conversion efficiency. In Phase II, a prototype TPV generator to deliver between 500-1000 W of electricity will be deployed. A final system efficiency of greater than 20% is anticipated. A solar TPV system can be a cost effective, compact, highly efficient, totally radiation hard replacement for any electric generator used in space or on earth where continuous or intermittent sunlight is available. Solar TPV will be a zero emission, high power system which uses a renewable energy source. It will be very reliable and quite, and it contains a battery-less maintenance free long life energy storage system. The system can be easily scaled to provide power levels suitable for many commercial or military uses.",

        "abstract": "The demand for improvement in the perf ormance and ef f iciency of modern turbines requires the development of advanced materials which retain high strength, creep and oxidation resistance at increasingly elevated temperatures.  Many materials meet the high-temperature criteria, for example ceramics, some intermetallic compounds and metallo-ceramics such as MoSi2, but suffer from a lack of toughness, either because of persistent brittleness at high temperatures or because a ductile-brittle transition (DBT) takes place between operating and room temperatures.  Critical to the utility of these materials is an understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the DBT and specific indication of how the impact of the DBT can be minimized or avoided.  This proposal will focus directly on MOS'21 an MC material which, at high temperatures, combines the strength typical of ceramics with the toughness of metals.  The proposed work will use an innovative, inter-disciplinary technique (combining fundamental quantum mechanics with materials science) to evaluate the temperature dependence of dislocation nucleation and mobility and hence determine the origin of the DBT in MOS'2.  From this a prescription will be developed for increasing the fracture toughness of MOS'2 by microalloying to eliminate or control the DBT.",

These pulsars can have risetimes as fast as 150 ps, peak powers as high as 100 GW, and repetition rates as fast as 1 kHz. Examples such as the \"H2\" and \"H3\" pulsars developed by Phillips Laboratory have already been built and tested, and a new design that should reach 100 GW, called \"HASP,\" is currently being built. A difficulty remains with this technology, however, because no suitable antenna exists to radiate such fast risetimes at these high power levels.  The purpose of this project is to develop suitable antennas for this class of sources.  This class of pulsars could carry out critical new missions in a variety of military and commercial applications.  Of particular interest, is the possibility of using these sources as part of a transient radar system to locate mines and unexploded ordnance (UXO).  The promise of these many applications remains unrealized, because they generate large power levels in an \"unbalanced\" form that is difficult to radiate.  However, a new technology, called the \"Half IRA\" (where IRA stands for Impulse Radiating Antenna) promises to radiate these sources with little loss, while still preserving the risetime.  The goal of this project will be to develop an antenna that can take advantage of this class of sources.",

Hybrid methods incorporating best wavelet packet features combined with wavelet zero tree coding have the flexibility needed for both texture and structure compression. These can be easily incorporated under the same tree based signal processing structure and are of low computational complexity promising realtime applications.

This proposal is responsive to this need. It provides for a Phase I project to design and prove the feasibility of a noise abatement device for use on automobiles instead of conventional resonators and mufflers. This concept uses active noise abatement techniques. Prior art has limited these techniques to known and regular noise generation such as sixty cycle hum in commercial power generation systems. The innovation opportunity here is to extend, or rather develop new technology which will enable this approach to work on irregular noise such as that generated by the exhaust from automobiles. The proposed approach utilizes digital techniques to construct an equal and opposite sound wave to effectively cancel the noise source. Other innovative components include the sensor for sensing the noise and the transducer for countering the noise. Anticipated Benefits: There are many automobiles. Each one is a potential customer for this improved technique which will reduce noise and improve fuel economy, thus saving fel and reducing the consumption of fuel in motor vehicles.

        "abstract": "Currently optical fibers are drawn from preforms that require complicated processing steps and repeated batch-type handling. This increases the cost of the ultimate fiber because preform cost often represents more than 50% of the fiber cost.  Additionally, since the preform rod has a specific volume, the length of the fiber that can be drawn is limited.  This increases the number of optical couplers and amplifiers needed to achieve a very long signal path from the relatively short segments drawn.  This also adds potential variability in optical performance and an increased probability of mechanically weak points in the fiber system.  Both these aspects further increase the system cost.  These problems can be reduced by developing a novel process in which glass precursor coatings are formed on a continuously moving filamentary core of material which is removed or becomes a part of the ultimately formed optical fiber.  Optimizing the process to yield strong, low loss optical fibers of ultra long length should significantly lower the cost of optical fiber systems for various military and commercial applications for communications.  The sol-gel process also should provide the opportunity to develop specialty fibers/sensors for environmental and other applications with improved reliability and reduced cost.  The proposed Phase I study involves a thorough investigation of state-of-the-art processing for applying sol-gel glass coatings to host core filaments and vitrifying the coatings into high quality optical fibers, comparable in mechanical and optical properties with fibers obtained by the current preform method.  These results will be used as the starting point for the further development and optimization studies in Phase II to arrive at a reliable process to yield ultra long length optical fibers with uniform, high quality optical and mechanical properties.",

        "abstract": "A number of techniques currently exist for computing rotorcraft aerodynamic flow fields.  These range from very fast lifting line schemes which only include the simplest incompressible, inviscid modules for rotor-blades and wake, to full CFD compressible, inviscid potential free-wake methods which are moderately fast, through full compressible Euler/Navier-Stokes methods for rotors and bodies, which are very expensive and have only been used to date for parts of the rotorcraft problem.  Currently, there techniques are only used in widely different studies, typically by different engineers, due to the widely different computational speeds and performances of the schemes.  A systematic approach is described to combine these techniques into a \"multi-level system\".  The basic idea is that each method will be implemented in a code module which will use essentially the same input and output and appear to a user as almost the same code. Then, the user can easily and quickly do computations for the same problem with different modules, with varying levels of accuracy and speed.  This will be very important for rotorcraft engineering design and analysis where a large number of cases (several hundred) must be computed for parametric and optimization studies. Currently, oly very simple, fast codes are used for these studies which lack important aerodynamic effects.  With the proposed multi-level system, an engineer will be able to still do a large number of fast runs, typically on a workstation.  However, after every set of fast runs, a single, higher fidelity run will be made.  The difference in the results between the simple and higher fidelity runs will be used to modify the subsequent set of simple, fast runs so that they include the effects that the simple code, by itself, would have neglected, without greatly increasing the computational time.",

The critical problem in fabricating these smart materials is to produce a ceramic-metal bond that can endure the high stress-strain state cycles to which it will be subjected in use. This bonding cannot be accomplished using conventional techniques that heat the entire assembly. In this project a pulsed electron beam (PEB) bonding system will be fabricated and tested. PEB irradiation has the capability of depositing the electron energy preferentially near the bond interface, producing a temperature profile than can fuse the dissimilar materials together with the potential to leave the bulk properties of the piezoelectric and shape memory alloy intact. In this Phase I project lead lanthanum zirconium titanate (PLZT) piezoelectrics and Ni-Ti shape memory alloys will be subjected to PEB irradiation and their properties evaluated before and after irradiation. The PEB parameters (e.g., electron energy, beam pulse length and repetition rate) will be set based upon Monte Carlo computer simulations that predict temperature profiles leading to bonding. Piezoelectric elements will be bonded to shape memory alloy foils in Phase II using the beam parameters determined in this Phase I project and the properties of the bonded materials evaluated. Anticipated Benefits: Vibration cancellation systems based upon the proposed smart materials could be applied to machine tools or the tool-machine interface to enable precision machining (e.g., 0.1 mil tolerance) without the use of expensive or large cutting machines or tool holders.

It has recently been demonstrated that helicopter rotor vibration comprises a periodic \"component\" and a chaotic \"component.\" The periodic part can be eliminated using Higher Harmonic Control (HHC), leaving the chaotic component. Until recently, it was considered unfeasible to further reduce the vibrations. A new method, called the OGY technique, has been discovered which permits many chaotic systems to be controlled. In the proposed program, the OGY technique will be extended and combined with HHC to essentially eliminate rotor-generated vibrations in helicopters. In Phase I, acutal helicopter vibrations data will be analyzed to prove that the chaotic vibrations are controllable. This program will be performed with the participation of the Boeing Helicopter Company, who will provide proprietary vibration data. Phase II will include a demonstration of combined HHC and chaotic control in actual helicopter testing, wind tunnel testing, or through numerical simulation.",

The proposed tunable sting subsystem allows the shooter to preselect the effect on the target.  At low settings the net will perform only as an ensnarement weapon which will delay flight and make physical resistance more difficult.  In the case where there is a high risk associated with an armed adversary the shooter can maximize the setting which will make any form of resistance impossible.  The proposed system takes maximum advantage of existing and ongoing research by complimenting net and deployment designs by FMI and several fuzing an delivery weapons designs by other companies. The proposed program effort will concentrate on incorporating existing medical information on shock levels into the system design, reviewing snare net data to determine the best wiring pattern in conjunction with the medical advice and confirming circuit designs which must account for potential short-circuits, and survivability of the sting subsystem the physical shock of deployment and capture.",

Research has been conducted to develop through thickness reinforcement technologies to offset these limitations. Foster-Miller's Z-Fiber process has demonstrated 30 fold increases in fracture toughness with little degradation to in-plane properties. This baseline Z-Fiber process has promise to limit airfoil structure FOD Damage and as a joining method for co-cured stiffened skin structures.  Boeing and FM IRADs and Wright Lab initiated JTCG seed funding has demonstrated feasibility of an advance version of Z-Fiber technology entitled Ultrasonically Assisted Z-Fiber (UAZ).  In this process ultrasonic technology replaces autoclave heat and pressure requirements.  The UAZ process makes additional applications for Z-Fiber feasible along with reinforcement of cured thermoset and thermoplastic structures.  Successful development of this technology offers cost reduction, repair options, joining of cured structures, and application to thermoplastics and complex contours.  Boeing and FM plan to support UAZ with CY95 IRAD.  Additional SBIR funding would maximize the potential to bring this technology to the shop floor.

Foster-Miller proposes to combine a newly emerging Engineered Response gel technology with specialized process equipment to produce a regenerative, cost effective and portable system for treating these wastewaters in a regulatory compliant manner.  The key innovation involves a new class of polymeric gels that can be tailored to adsorb surface active agents and chemically-stabilized oil emulsions at loadings which could approach 50 times their weight of the gel.  The Phase I program focuses on the synthesis and characterization of the polymeric gels in synthetic wastewaters with respect to both adsorption and regeneration and the design and cost estimate of a prototype field demonstration unit.

Designs for these new systems typically only exist at the conceptual or preliminary design level, yet trade studies must be performed to assess cost and effectiveness, as well as overall affordability.  Bottoms up estimating techniques cannot be used without performing a complete detail design, a time consuming and expensive process.  Estimation by analogy only works when the new system or concept is similar, both technologically and functionally, with an existing system, a requirement that is often not met.  Planners require a methodology and toolset which enables concept cost estimation when only operational or functional performance requirements are available.  Objectives of this SBIR are to refine a methodology for estimating avionics life cycle cost based on system level performance requirements.  The Phase I program will demonstrate feasibility of the proposed approach and provide a limited functionality prototype of a PC based software tool which implements aspects of the methodology.  The initial effort will develop cost estimating relationships, and demonstrate utility for the Air Force TMD Attack Operations effort.  The Phase II program will fully develop the cost estimating software tool.

Agricultural revenues have been stagnant for almost 5 years, agricultural support and service industries have virtually disappeared from rural communities, and farmers have recently lost a major share of regional markets for barley and oats to Canadian products which benefit from transportation subsides.  Planned reductions in local timber production are expected to result in job losses as high as 50% over the next five years.  Forage-based agriculture offers excellent potential as an alternative enterprise to address both the economic and ecological challenges facing the area.  Several areas in the northwest have revitalized their economies by diversifying to forage products.  The area is well suited for the production of perennial grass hays and the recent development of prototype mechanized bale harvesting equipment compatible with the steep, highly erodible terrain in northern Idaho offers the foundation technology to support a rural development program to transition or diversify from cereal based cropping.  Recently over 2000 tons of local forage products, much of which was harvested by this prototype equipment, was sold for export.  The proposed research will make a comprehensive evaluation of the agronomic, equipment, economic, marketing and sociological issues associated with the feasibility of forage based agriculture as an alternative enterprise for rural development in northern Idaho.",

This system will play a major role in guidingcolonoscopes through the colon to the cecum. It will increase the efficiency of colonoscopy, save time,and possibly decrease morbidity due to the procedure by reducing excess looping in the colon, asignificant factor in colonic perforation.

The defeat mechanism is based on exploitation of highly exothermic condensed phase reactions producing three ingredients which play key role in missile-defeat. These include: the generation of non-oxidizing metal vapor, an intense fireball consisting of reactive/hot particulates and reactive hot pellets of higher penetration capability. The defeat mechanism results from one or a combination of several effects such as blinding IR and RF sensors by intense fireball and on the metal coating, as well as mechanical damage to the missile structure by the hot refractory fragments with high penetration capability.",

Remarkable advances have been made in the areas of solid-state amplifiers, digital sampling and processing hardware, as well as in computer hardware and software used to analyze and visualize physical results.  In the proposed approach, commercially available components and sub-systems are utilized at they cross the high-cost threshold into the decidedly less costly mass markets.  When clever design principles are applied and effective data acquisition algorithms are employed, one routinely achieves performance exceeding that of more costly systems built only a few years ago.  Thus, the revolution in low-cost components triggers similar changes in the radar diagnostics available within the budgetary constraints of the Federal Government and the commercial market place.  The proposed effort consists of a design study along with the associated development of a prototype system.  Particular attention is paid to VHF systems near 140 MHz, where current technology is immature and prospects for securing frequency assignments for operations are good.  A radar diagnostic in this portion of the VHF band is extremely effective for a variety of studies involving natural atmospheric and ionospheric processes, investigations of artificial perturbations of the atmosphere, identification of hard-target signatures and turbulent wakes of interest to the USAF, and commercial probing of the earth's sub-surface.",

Program objective is to develop complex shaped ceramic containers (shells) for soft die hot pressing of powders using the RCC process. Shells to be developed are intended for consolidation of copper alloys, iron, iron base alloys, and stainless steels. Taguchi methods will be used to design and execute the experimental study. Experiments will involve design factors such as shell chemistry, time and temperature of drying, particle size, etc. If successful, the results will allow commercialization of the RCC process for small and medium sized P/M parts. Phase II work will scale-up the shell size, provide scientific understanding of successful shell compositions, and produce prototype parts, and test them. The RCC process has the potential of becoming a major P/M process which can expand markets served by the P/M industry into larger and more complex shaped parts. Anticipated Benefits: The proposed research and development effort will allow the potential of the RCC process to be realized. Manufacture of small and medium sized complex shaped parts, up to now impossible to manufacutre by any other P/M process, will be possible. Many castings and welded assemblies, including those used in aero-space applications, may be replaced by RCC products with better properties and lower cost.",

        "abstract": "The short pulse length of ultra wide bandwidth (UWB) radar systems allows them to penetrate dense media such as foliage, thereby permitting battlefield surveillance of artillery and infantry. Due to their short pulse width, the UWB radars are susceptible to interference from FM and AM radio, and television stations. These narrowband interfering signals have to be suppressed to effectively operate the UWB radar system. Adaptive interference suppression techniques based on separating the eigenspaces spanned by the interference signals, and the clutter and target echoes, are proposed. Because the interference is narrowband compared to the echoes, the dimension of the vector space spanned by the interference signals is much smaller than the clutter echoes. The proposed technique suppresses interference by projecting the received data (clutter and target echoes plus interference signals) onto the orthogonal complement of the vector space spanned by the interference. The eigen-space spanned by the interference is estimated using the measured data. Computational efficiency is improved by using a proprietary algorithm that calculates the interference eigenvalues and eigenvectors more rapidly than concentional eigendecomposition routines. A computer architecture for implementing the interference suppression technique will also be developed.",

In spite of numerous government and industry programs to cost reduce MMC materials, they remain expensive... driven by the high cost of raw materials and labor intensive manufacturing and inspection processing.  Extending the useful life cycle of MMC materials would allow its high initial acquisition cost to be spread out over a much longer life cycle and make MMC materials more cost competitive.

The proposed SBIR Phase I proof of concept research will:  1) Formulate a large water range communication/instrumentation technical specification,  2) Develop a Phase I test plan to demonstrate key specification capabilities,  3) Breadboard a proof of concept testbed,  4) Conduct key proof of concept demonstrations,  5) Submit a Phase I final technical report and Phase II prototype system demonstration plan.  Info-geometric devices possess the ability to mutually communicate with (info) and track (geometric) each other. Groups of info-geometric devices cooperatively form self organizing data fusion networks. Any info-geometric devices passing near an info-geometric fusion network (i) may be accurately tracked in location and orientation by the network, (ii) may communicate instrumentation data to the network, and (iii) may receive command guidance data from the network. The large water instrumented test range consists of info-geometric beacon units (IBU's) deployed at sea (unsurveyed, drifting). HTI has demonstrated IBU mutual communication rates of 64 kilobits per second and mutual range resolution of 5-to-10 centimeters in earlier ARPA and NCCOSC research programs, that exceed the performance requirements of the proposed research. Any test platform possessing a low cost info-geometric transponder will be automatically tracked by the large water range. Its tracked location and communicated instrumentation data will be reported to one or more info-geometric base station units for monitoring and scoring. The large water range will be capable of simultaneously tracking at least one hundred info-geometric transponders. The info-geometric instrumentation may take alternative forms to address specific tracking requirements. \"Remodulation tags\" are low cost transponders that can be tracked by the large water range at moderate distances with high precision...(this is the subject of a separate SBIR Phase I proof of concept proposal for aircraft interaction testing).

The bacterium is ubiquitous, and thus rapid, reliable, sensitive, and cost-effective assays are needed to detect the toxin.  Current immunoassays provide a rapid means to detect the neurotoxin.  Their sensitivity, however, is limited by the affinity of the detecting antibody.  The objective of this research, therefore, is to develop high-affinity anti-botulinal antibody through recombinant DNA technology.  During Phase I, we will take a two pronged approach to generate recombinant botulinal antibodies.  First, we will construct a phage-display heavy and light chain variable gene combinatorial library from a botulinal toxin A hyperimmunized animal. Bacteriophage displaying the neurotoxin reactive antibody fragments will be affinity selected and clonally isolated for subsequent analysis.  As the combinatorial library may not represent in vivo occurring heavy-light chain combinations or all anti-toxin A immunoglobulin classes, we will in the second approach produce monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) by traditional hybridoma techniques, following which the encoding cDNAs will be cloned.  In future work, the cDNAs from the isolated antibody fragment-displaying phage and from selected Mabs will be engineered for higher affinity recombinant antibodies, providing an invariant, stable, and inexpensive immunoassay reagent.",

Perception of tolerance for deviations from \"normal\" will be quantitated using psychophysical methods. A user-friendly computer program will be developed to present a series of digitally-modified images of gradations of changes in physical dimensions of the soft-tissue profile (STP) as continuous rather than discrete changes, much like a flower blossoming in continuous slow motion. Specifically, the anterior-posterior (A-P) positions of the upper (UL), lower lips (LL), chin and vertical dimension will change continuously from extreme positions of unacceptability. Without an intermediate operator, the respondent indicates acceptability by pressing a computer-interfaced button until the feature is no longer acceptable. The measurement of perceived deviation from \"normal\"-appearing faces is critical to understanding the bases of social behavior toward persons who differ from accepted but unspecified standards of physical appearance. Ultimately, a data base of ranges of tolerance for physical deviation of individual features will be provided for use by clinicians now relying on intuition or anthropometric norms. This will be particularly useful for persons with craniofacial deformities as well as for women tyrannized by media-promulgated \"standards\" of youth, thinness and attractiveness.",

With ever increasing complexity of modern weapons systems and current political environment, the need to reduce development time and cost has never been greater.  Amongst a myriad of techniques that have been introduced, Rapid Prototyping has brought the most significant improvements.  Rapid Prototyping (RP) is a new class of model fabrication process that creates a 3-dimensional object directly from a solid CAD file by electronically sectioning the object and physically reconstructing each cross section one layer at a time with minimal human intervention.  The technique allows fabrication of models at previously unsurpassed speeds.  Despite its success and steady progress over the past 5 years, the state of current RP technology does not allow direct fabrication of fully functional models for more extensive testing.  In light of the aforementioned limitations and potential benefits, Helisys proposes a 6 month R&D program aimed at applying innovations in materials, software, and laser optics to the already successful commercial process called Laminated Object Manufacturing (LOM).",

Techniques will be investigated to first model and then control acoustic resonance in open cavity flows.  The problem consists of the nonlinear interaction between a turbulent free shear layer and the cavity acoustics and is further complicated by the reattachment geometry and the acoustic receptivity of the separating shear layer.  This problem focuses on first developing an accurate yet computationally inexpensive physical model and then actively minimizing the cavity acoustic levels by modifying the shear-layer characteristics with actuators controlled by a neural network.  This approach is innovative in both the development of a previously nonexistent dynamic model and application of actuators and neural network-based controllers to the flow-induced weapons bay acoustic problem.

While low-cost compact receivers using \"GPS engines\" are available, their use on-board highly maneuverable missiles is limited by the up-date rate, processing power, and the local oscillator stability over the operating environmental conditions. To overcome these limitations, Hittite proposes a transponder-based approach which uses high capacity data processing capability located on a remote platform or on the ground. This proposal describes Hittite's approach to implement the GPS translator system for missile tracking. Trade-off studies of system architecture, transponder, processor and communication links will be performed. Both single transponder/INS and multiple transponder architectures will be investigated. Design approaches of the transponder portion of the translator, based on the effective utilization of MMIC technology, for aplications on missile platforms will be investigated. The optimum system configuration will emerge as a combination of on-board miniaturized transponder(s) and remotely located digital signal processor.

HNC has implemented this algorithm in the laboratory using HNC's Vision Processor (ViP) chip set was developed by HNC and ARPA to perform high speed image and neural network processing. The ViP consists of two VLSI gate arrays that can perform fundamental processing operations such as large kernel convolution, subtraction of two images, multiplication of two images and look-up table transformation of an image. A daughterboard with the ViP is built and is available from HNC as a commercial product. HNC proposes to extend our preliminary work with NRL algorithm, analyze its restrictions and precision requirements, investigate improvements, compare its performance to other possible algorithms, and since we have existing hardware that can perform non-uniformity correction in close to real-time, demonstrate and test that hardware using MWIR or LWIR imagery.",

The fast head has no moving parts on it and is very light-weighted. The technique used to store data is very tolerant to translational misalignment. Because of this valuable property, tracking electronics are built with standard inexpensive components. When built, the read/write module will sustain a recording rate in excess of 10 Megabits/second, a readout rate of 240 Megabits/second, and a random access time of approximately 20 milliseconds. The storage density of the disk is approximately 122 bits per square micron. The anticipated benefit of the proposed research is to support a data storage system with high capacity and fast access time of the data. Applications that may benefit from this project include and systems that require large data bases.",

The technology is applicable to the high-volume production of a broad range of military and commercial components requiring surface accuracies between 0.3 and 0.006 microns. The feasibility to combine precision optical polishing techniques with fast, defect-free, chemical-mechanical polishing methods will be demonstrated. An innovative, wear-resistant and stable, fluorocarbon lap is used to replicate its precision surface onto the workpiece using a silica hydrosol slurry. To address the immediate requirements of the microelectronics industry, HTG will first demonstrate the ability to polish silicon wafers, silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrates, and to planarize interlevel dielectrics to a precision not possible using resilient polymeric laps. The methods are equally applicable to superpolishing precision glass and metal optical components. In addition to enhancing lithographic resolution, process latitude, and yield for IC's with 0.35 - 0.25 micron features on bulk silicon, HTG's methods can used to fabricate larger, lower-cost, SOI substrates for commercial CMOS-SOI logic and SRAM chips.

Advances in SIMOX technology include radiation hardened memories and gate arrays for space applications, ULSI DRAMs for low voltage operation, thin film SOI BiCMOS for low power circuitry, and extreme (400 oC) temperature applications of SIMOX circuitry. A thin (100 nm) buried oxide (BOX) SIMOX product is under development in order to significantly reduce the cost of the cost of the substrates for both military and commercial applications. recent device survivability studies have indicated that conventional hardening processes applied to SIMOX are not feasible unless the buried oxide density is near to that of thermal oxide. For the thin BOX experimental process, the hardening mechanisms will not work due to the 9% difference in BOX density as measured by spectroscopic ellipsometry. This Phase I proposal examines the feasibility of an innovative density reduction process for developing a hardened thin BOX SIMOX product. Buried oxide material quality and radiation hardness will be assessed via electrolytic tests and BOXCAP device performance. Commercialization of a radiation hardened thin BOX SIMOX product will be aggressively pursued. The nation may expect to benefit from the development of a low cost, radiation hardened semiconductor substrate process. Systems and components fabricated on hardened SIMOX will assist both military and commercial applications requiring high dose survivability.

If these virtual parts indicate a high rejection rate, the process can be refined or additional diagnostic tests can be conducted within VMIS to isolate and correct the problems.

        "abstract": "A viable component-ware technology infrastructure is starting to emerge industry-wide.  The basis of this infrastructure is a critical mass of the leading platform vendors adopting an object-based distributed computing specification: Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA).  We propose to advance current CORBA technology through the development of two key innovations: (1) run-time (dynamic) or compile-time (static) semantic-based composition and synthesis of reusable software components and (2) the ability to replicate and manage critical software elements). The Reliable Object Management Service (ROMS) will enable the deployment of fault-tolerant services based on object replication and management.  Critical operations will be able to continue in a gracefully degraded fashion if any one copy of a system element fails.  The long-range goal of this proposed work is to overcome barriers to building and deploying systems from verified, reusable software components.  Reusable component-ware will result in significant reductions in the cost of system testing and requirements validation for mission-critical systems.",

This project attemptsto improve detection and diagnosis of breast masses in dense breast tissue by developing an ultrasoundimaging system that correlates with x-ray mammography. The approach is (1) develop compressionpaddles which allow transmission of ultrasound without undue attenuation or multiple reflections and(2) to ultrasonically scan the breast while it is held by ultrasound transmission compression paddleswhich provide the same pressure and breast orientations that are used in x-ray mammography. Twoexperimental ultrasound imaging systems based on this approach have been developed at IBC. One unitis designed to demonstrate the effectiveness of an instrument which combines x-ray and ultrasound.The other unit, which does not include x-ray, is designed for patients for whom x-ray mammography isinappropriate.

Major contributors to insomnia include periodic limbmovements (PLM) in sleep and restless legs (RL). Night-to-night variability and expensive, inconvenienttesting limits clinical and research work with these conditions. This project will develop technologyneeded to produce a self-contained, easily-used, ambulatory leg activity monitor (LAM) that will detectand record over several days the occurrence of characteristic periodic movements. The data, transferredto a Computer are analyzed for PLM and RL rates. This provides the first objective measurement of allnaturally occurring RL and of all PLM over several nights. The LAM technology uses piezoelectricsensors to detect activity and microprocessors to pre-process data by identification of candidate periodicmovements and storage of periodicity information. This permits recording all periodic movements for16 or more consecutive day. Phase 1 tests feasibility of accurately capturing and correctly identifyingall periodic movements. Phase 2 will serve to establish the LAM as a very user-friendly standard fordiagnosis, severity assessment, screening and treatment evaluation.

The ultrasonic transmitter-receiverportions of the Doppler/M-mode and real time digital signal processing hardware will be interfaced witha personal computer for display and analysis.

Before such transducers are made this stris of the alloy with the proper crystalline orientation which maximizes the anisotropic magnetostrictive behavior must be manufactured. An innovative and novel appraoch using a melt spinning technique is proposed. With this approach it is believed that the cooling rate in the ribbons can be adequately controlled to generate a columnar microstructure of hemagonal crystals with the o axis oriented along the thickness of the melt spun ribbons. The m or b axis, the axis of maximum magnetostriction, will be aligned along the length or width of the ribbon allowing the ribbon to be stacked to form a very sensitive magnetostrictive transducer. This is contrasted to conventional melt spinning methods where the existence of thermal gradients in the ribbons limits the degree of orientation. The degree of optimal orientation can be further enhanced and controlled by appropriate additional processing.",

        "abstract": "Concrete is used extensively for building defense and civilian structures as it is highly damage resistant, inexpensive, durable and can be cast into any form.  Concrete can be subjected to a variety of extremely large stress events.  The survivability of concrete structures could be enhanced if the mechanical behavior of concrete at elevated stresses and strain rates was known.  This information can be obtained from the equation of state of concrete.  Typically, the equation of state is obtained from shock wave tests.  This approach can be expensive and time consuming, especially if the magnitude of the strain and the strain rate need to be controlled.  An alternative technique, in this proposal, is to determine the equation of state of concrete and geological materials by measuring the elastic properties as a function of applied load and eliminates the need for sample constraint to prevent shear failure.  With the knowledge obtained from the equation of state, it will be possible to enhance the survivability of defense and civilian structures if they are exposed to high strain events.",

To that end, propagation data has been taken at VHF/UHF over the ocean under the ARPA-sponsored ADI Mountain-Top program. this data has been reduced to some degree, however, a detailed analysis of the data for the purposes of model validation has yet to be performed. To fully realize the benefits of this measurement program, the data must be analyzed, characterized, and used to validate propagation and scattering models which can be used for performance analysis of advanced radar and communications systems. Information Systems Laboratories, Inc. and CODAR Ocean Sensors, Ltd., propose to analyze a subset of the propagation data under Phase I. This will allow for a preliminary comparison of the data propagation and scattering models. Based on this preliminary analysis, a detailed test plan will be developed to analyze the remaining Mountain-Top propagation data and validate models for use in radar and communication system performance analysis. Anticipated Benefits: It is anticipated that this work would benefit many radar and communication system programs in the HF/VHF band, including both military and commercial systems. There are many commercial applications involving radio waves near the sea. Maritime communications systems often involve transmitters and receivers just above the sea Commercial radars are being used increasingly to map ocean surface currents and to monitor sea state, including those made by CODAR Ocean Sensors, Ltd.",

The first objective is to demonstrate the ability to manufacture near-absolute net-shape brake calipers meeting TACOM's design requirements, including a weight reduction for calipers of 60%, for the DEMO III PLS (Palletized Loading System) test vehicle. The second objective is to optimize alumina reinforced A1 alloy systems and to generate a preliminary data base on the optimized system for brake calipers. Over 1,200 net-shpate mechanical test specimens will be manufactured for the materials system optimization and preliminary data base studies with minor machining required, thus demonstrating the near-absolute net-shape capability of the process and a machining cost saving of $60,000. MMCC will perform metrology on each specimen and tooling wear and stability studies to evaluate the near-absolute net-shape capability of the process. MMCC will also evaluate the design of mold tooling for maximum re-use. A third objective is to manufacture four prototype calipers. The final objective is to develop a process cost model for brake calipers. Anticipated Benefits: A highly precise casting method capable of lower costs than die casting or squeeze casting will be developed for reinforced as well as unreinforced castings. A 60% reduction in unsprung weight of brake calipers for army trucks will become available.

Wavelets have an extremely rich mathematical foundation and have been proven valuable for a variety of applications.  New ideas are being pursued at a breathtaking pace leading to innovative algorithms.  The challenge before us now is to identify and harness these ideas and develop a coherent set of tools which can be applied to practical problems in signal and image processing.  The central focus of this proposal is to develop a complete and mature methodology for signal recovery and de-noising based on wavelets.  We use the term wavelets in a broad sense to include the many wavelet-like transforms such as wavelet packets and local cosine bases.  We will improve and extend existing procedures to correct for artifacts and handle more general problems.  Based on our research, we will build an object-oriented software toolkit using the S-Plus language.  The toolkit will provide a rich foundation of tools for wavelet de-noising.  We will evaluate the procedures using real and simulated data drawn from a variety of applications, including signal recovery, signal detection and classification, inverse problems (parameter estimation), density estimation, and image and image array reconstruction and enhancement.",

        "abstract": "For most security systems covering large facilities, the initial detection is the easiest part of the surveillance problem.  Once alerted to a possible intrusion, response personnel often must physically challenge human intruders to verify the intruder as authorized or unauthorized.  The authentication procedure varies but commonly employs either verbal challenge or visual inspection of a badge or other documentation.  During this challenge, an electro-optic or infrared surveillance camera is often employed to monitor the proceedings.  From a remotely positioned camera, however, it is difficult or impossible to distinguish the response team personnel from the intruders.  Without this knowledge, it may be difficult to assess a situation and react properly to it.  Some type of detection system is therefore required that can be used on conjunction with the camera system to remotely identify response personnel and distinguish them from possible intruders.  To solve this problem, ISI proposes a program to develop a low cost innovative concept to identify human intruders in restricted areas with the following goals:  1. The analysis and specification of system requirements.  2. Generation and feasibility analysis of system concepts.  3. Technical risk reduction and demonstration of the concept.",

As a result, rural communities may not participate in the benefits of access to the National Information Infrastructure now being defined.  Recent advances in wireless communictions technology, and FCC authorization of Personal Communications Services (PCS), present an opportunity to define a low-cost, high performance infrastructure for voice, data, and video communications.  This applied research effort seeks to verify the technical feasibility of wireless local or metropolitan area-network (LAN/MAN) technology as a basis for this infrastructure.  A LAN/MAN would function as a real-time community forum where users could access information related to distance learning, health care, local government activities, local community activities, and local business activities; and also obtain high-speed connectivity to other networks such as the Internet.  The Phase I research will define the functional elements of a system to provide such services.  A review of recent research has identified pertinent technologies and product types that will be modeled and analyzed.  This will validate key aspects of system architecture and define key performance requirements for system elements.  Planned coordination with residents of rural Colorado communities will verify that the proposed services are appropriate for the rural markets.",

An evaluation will be made of the system processing speed, power and size for a proposed packaging approach. The fanout tradeoffs will be determined. The evaluation will determine a suitable architecture from the five possibilities of an optical artificial neural network, an optical quadratic processor, an optical morphological processor and an interferometric processor.

Recently, a new hardware concept was developed which promises to greatly increase the dynamic range of the measurements made during illumination.  This new system also promises a reduction in noise, size and costs.  This concept, named the dual channel down converter (DCDC), has been successfully demonstrated in a preliminary test.  This SBIR effort proposed to investigate several modifications to the hardware.  These modifications have three objectives.  first, some of the modification swill serve to remedy shortcomings identified during the preliminary use of the DCDC.  Second, some will serve to increase the performance of the hardware.  Third, some will reduce the cost of a measurement system based on the DCDC concept.  An industrial partner has been identified for this project, Wiltron Company in Morgan Hill, California.  The potential commercial products form this effort include a network analyzer on a computer card and versatile, low cost RF measurement systems.  Wiltron's experience in the design, manufacture and sales of RF and microwave equipment will greatly enhance the possibility of a commercial product resulting from this effort.",

The initial camera prototype will employ commercially available and custom VLSI components.  The CCD imager, digital processor, and positioning system will be off-the-shelf and the remainder of the components will be custom VLSI.  Also, in the initial prototype,m the VLSI components will be fabricated in a planar IC technology. This simplified design approach for the initial prototype will allow rapid proof-of-concept.

Hoever, data collected by MCM contractors reveals that the absence of proper design process management was the major barrier for achieving such goals. To greatly improve MCM design process management practices, this research effort will propose and develop an MCM Design Process manager consisting of a design process representation, a design process integration mechanism, and a design process management framework. The key technical innovations for this effort include a multi-perspective family of MCM design processes, an open system methodology for integrating EDA frameworks, and a computer-aided MCM design process management methodology. This software will orchestrate the various activities, resources, and roles in the MCM design by serving as a \"forcing function\" to the collaborative design process as well as a \"tracking and measurement mechanism\" during design. Anticipated Benefits: Achieving an order of magnitude reduction in module cost and cycle time with first pass design success will make Multi-chip Modules a commercially viable technology for the U.S. computer, consumer electronics, telecommunications, and automotive industries. Affordable MCM technology will play a major role in making these industries globally competitive.",

Modern manufacturing technology requires an increasingly detailed statistical summary of the impact of processes on devices. Non-invasive techniques that can probe samples without interfering with a process line operation are crucial in this goal. We have already implemented this minority-carrier lifetime measurement to characterize Silicon-on-Insulator (SOI) samples as thin as 50 nm. We propose to extend the performance to shorter lifetimes (permitting more and thinner materials to be studied) and to smaller regions (permitting use as a monitor of product wafers). In addition, we intend to improve existing technology to permit rapid and routine operation. While useful for many materials this technique has proven especially useful in studies of SOI materials, since the superficial silicon films are electrically isolated from the substrate and therefore more difficult to characterize even by standard invasive techniques.",

It will have minimum energy consumption requirements and be extremely small, rugged and lightweight. Anticipated Benefits: Benefits include the development of new devices for measuring vibrations in structures and equipment such as rotorcraft. The commercial production of micromechanical devices is beneficial to the US economy, the integrated circuit processing industry and new MEM processing industry in particular. This project will show the applicability of microscale components to the solutions of engineering problems. These miniature devices have important medical military and commercial uses.",

        "abstract": "During a shipboard emergency, damage control supervisors must quickly get to the location of the incident and immediately begin evaluating the type, level, and location of the damage. The supervisor must draw upon and assimilate vast amounts of information, often relying on years of experience and training. The high stress associated with damage control environments, however, can result in an individual's failure to take into account valuable information. The supervisor's job is often made more difficult by the presence of smoke and obsurants which can severely limit vision, potentially delaying the supervisor's arrival at the site and/or affecting the accuracy of the evaluation. The combined lack of information and visual ability can severely impact the accuracy and timeliness of damage control assessments. A delayed or erroneous classification of type or severity could potentially result in a loss of equipment, mobility, readiness, or life. The contractor shall attempt to increase the responsiveness and effectiveness of damage control supervisors through the use of wearable hands-free computers equipped with infrared sensors. Such a system would enable individuals to \"see\" through smoke and obscurants while simultaneously and effortlessly accessing large amounts of computer-based data.",

This zinc-cadmium alloy can be plated using the dry plating process. However, a basic understanding of the process and its effects could be explored.

Expanding urbanization and public concern about flies associated with poultry facilities lead to confrontation or litigation.  Producers have few chemically based options available for fly control because of insecticide resistance and loss of insecticides to regulatory concerns.  Proven biological and cultural control options provide alternatives to the use of insecticides and support existing natural enemies of the house fly.\n\nThis project is designed to provide producers with a renewable fly control option using an important natural enemy of flies associates with poultry houses.  The hister beetle, Carcinops pumilio, is a significant predator of fly eggs and larvae that occurs in large populations in well established poultry houses.  However, to avoid Salmonella outbreaks, poultry producers routinely fumigate houses between flocks.  This process destroys the beetle population which are then difficult to re-establish under natural conditions.  In contrast, the fly population re-establishes quickly usually resulting in a fly outbreak.  Producers could avoid fly outbreaks by artificially establishing a predatory beetle population in the poultry house before house flies become established.",

Critical realtime performance features, including measures of delay, delay jitter, throughput, synchronization, scheduling, and reliability must be tightly controlled in an integrated services networking environment. The purpose of this proposed work is to use the structure of the currently existing IRI \"Planyst\" tool, to develop in Phase I models and methods that can then be used in Phase II for the development of a software based prototype tool for the planning and analysis of distributed realtime computer networks. The tool will also be used for calibrating the communications networking processes and parameters of realtime service support algorithms.

Using the third dimension to stack processor devices, promises to reduce substrate cost in direct relation to the number of processors stacked meeting the ten fold or more improvement in substrate costs by reducing the required substrate area. In addition, power and performance figures of merit will be improved as well. Reduced capacitive loading, caused by the asbsence of packages and by 3D silicon's extremely short interconnection wiring lines will lead to even better performance and lower power dissipation that previsouly achieved in other hybrid-WSI technologies. Typical interchip bussing distances for 3D silicon are on the order of tens of mils (0.010 inches), while those associated with other technologies are on the order of hundreds of mils. Also, Irvine Sensors' interconnect technology is pure resistive versus standard wire bonds which contain a good deal of inductance. This means less noise, and less current to charge and discharge signal nodes increasing performance and minimizing power.",

Measurement of phase shift and demodulation ratio are used to independently determine the scattering and absorption coefficients along the average path traveled by light in the tissue between this source and a detector. In our apparatus, the phase and demodulation can be accurately measured in real time on a millisecond time base. The important field of application of this tissue spectrometer is in medicine for measuring low concentrations of absorbing metabolites in tissues. In the proposed prototype, the modulated source consists of an array of laser diodes emitting at selected wavelengths relevant to the oxygenation state of the tissue. During Phase I of this project, a prototype instrument for research purposes will be assembled and tested both for integration of new components and limits of the technology.

For these reasons, the management of the effects of fatigue is of extreme importance to operators of fleets of aging aircraft. The U.S. Navy, for example, expends more than 2,000,000 man-hours per year managing aging effects on aircraft. [2] The ability to nondestructively detect and quantify accumulated fatigue damage, prior to the formation of detectable cracks, would be vitally important to that effort. This ability would permit earlier identification of areas experiencing accelerated aging due to fatigue, prompting modifications to inspection and maintenance programs. Cost savings and improved safety would follow. JENTEK Sensors, Inc., in an on-going Phase I SBIR grant from the Department of Energy, has recently demonstrated the capability to measure accumulated fatigue damage on specimens of stainless steel.

The primary factor inhibiting the routine usage of composite shelters by the military has been their high acquisition cost.  An approach to composite shelter design that from the outset uses an integrated design/build team approach to assure that shelter configurations are chosen to take maximum advantage of automated composite manufacturing technology is required to reduce cost.  During Phase I the proposal team will design composite ISO shelters using three different philosophies - a part-for-part replacement of the aluminum ISO shelter components currently in military service, a minimum weight design with little regard for cost, and a balanced cost/weight design emphasizing component tailoring for automated production technology. Pultrusion, filament winding, RTM, compression molding and braiding will all be evaluated for potential applicability to cost effective fabrication.

We are developing a suckometer with the long term application to various aspects of neonatal and post-natal care and study. This research focuses on the feeding behavior of very low birth weight infants with ultimate application to infants with other feeding problems due to congenital abnormality and other causes. The methodology used is based on the Kron sucking device which uses a specially designed nipple with linear flow restrictor. The restrictor transduces the intraoral pressure developed by a suckling infant into a pressure-time signal that can be analyzed to give a number of parameters relating to infant status. Previous research has shown the applicability of the method to evaluating the clinical state of full term and preterm infants. The present work is directed to developing specialized nipples and associated analysis software for studying the feeding behavior, development of sucking and swallowing of immature infants, and the related problems of infant care and transition to normal feeding activity. Such equipment and methodology should find a market in most newborn birthing facilities, infant intensive care units, and in similar facilities that specialize in the care of low birthweight and congenitally abnormal infants.

The purpose of such a device would be the use of high energy pulses for the ignition of a pyrotechnic or propellant from a remote location through a fiberoptic.  The low energy, high peak power pulses would be used as a system diagnostic, determining the integrity of the fiberoptic delivery system.  The replacement of wires with glass optical fiber is desirable as glass is invulnerable to electromagnetic fields.",

        "abstract": "Advanced information technologies create enormous increases in data availability and the potential for information overload. In addition, the pace of warfare will accelerate. C4I functions, attempting to meet the demands for accelerated planning cycles, will continue to require decision making under uncertainty. Next-generation C4I information management and decision support systems will need carefully designed human-computer interfaces to allow commanders and staff members to handle the uncertainty. It is critical that these interfaces support intuitive decision-making strategies, or else they may not be used, or may actually result in degraded performance. We propose to take advantage of recent breakthroughs in the field of naturalistic decision making. We will identify the key strategies used for managing uncertainty, and define human-computer interface features to support these strategies. The project will select a C4I system in development. To demonstrate the feasibility of building C4I displays that can help decision makers manage uncertainty, we will develop storyboards for an interface that will increase the effectiveness of the system. Phase II will cover software development and evaluation, and the presentation of design procedures the U.S. Marine Corps can use to enhance its C4I systems.",

        "abstract": "Wavelet transforms have already proved to be very useful tools in many signal processing applications including digital audio and video compression.  Although the wavelet-based representations offer more versatility in time-frequency localization than other Fourier methods, they tend to have  poor localization especially near high frequencies.  To eliminate this difficulty, we propose a technique for analyzing signals of time-varying characteristics using adaptive wavelet packets, which facilitates identification of arbitrarily localized spectral characteristics.  For nonstationary signals that contain varying distribution of spectral energy, the analysis must adaptively select filters of different localization properties.  Wavelet-packets designed through digital filter banks offer arbitrary tiling of the time-frequency domain.  Herley et al. [1993] report a double-tree algorithm that combines selection for the best wavelet-packet expansion with an adaptive time-segmentation of the signal simultaneously.  The system we propose here is an extension of the above algorithm together with a choice of a basis function from a library of wavelet packets.  We also propose to develop the pattern recognition capabilities based on feature vectors computed from the compressed signals.  A real-time prototype wavelet transform processor will be available in Phase II on an inexpensive parallel hardware called PC - CNAPS that operates as an accelerator board to a PC.",

        "abstract": "Diffractive optical elements (DOEs) have great potential for use in a variety of photonic applications in communications and computer networks.  One inherent limitation is their design for a specific, narrowband source.  This requires actively controlled laser diode sources to maintain wavelength stability for compact photonic applications involving laser diodes.  The finite bandwidth resulted in reduced image quality and diffraction efficiency.  We propose a new class of achromatic DOEs that use two surface-relief elements with compensating optical properties.  These DOEs will significantly relax the requirements for laser bandwidths and frequency stability.  Because of the compensating effects of the two elements, the relief surfaces can be fabricated using a coarse tolerance process and the DOEs can be inexpensively manufactured. The relief surface produced is continuous so the efficiency of these DOEs is very high.  The process tolerances allow the relief surface to be cast on one face of a refractive element enabling unique refractive/diffractive hybrids.  In Phase I, we will construct a hybrid optic that demonstrates the achromatic performance and characterize its performance.  Existing design techniques will be extended to incorporate the unique features of these hybrid achromatic DOEs.  In Phase II, the manufacturing techniques will be refined and hybrid optics fabricated for several wavelength regions.",

        "abstract": "This effort proposes to investigate novel optical transmitters with RF phase control for narrowband millimeter-wave (28-100 GHz) fiber-optic links using direct modulation of semiconductor lasers. Efficient fiber-optic transport and simultaneous, continuous phase control of the transmitted millimeter-wave signal is accomplished with the same device.  This allows military phased-array systems to exploit the advantages of fiber while reducing system cost and complexity.  Furthermore, these fiber links can provide high bandwidth services in present and future cable television and wireless communication systems.  Since this work is of obvious commercial and military interest it falls into a genuine \"dual-use\" category.  The innovative device is a split-contact monolithic semiconductor laser, cleaved to a length such that the laser round-trip cavity resonance occurs at the desired millimeter-wave frequency. Continuous control of the phase of the transmitted millimeter-wave frequency.  Continuous control of the phase of the transmitted millimeter-wave signal is accomplished by simply varying the bias current into the laser.  This task has been demonstrated at lower frequencies (1-7 GHz) using commercially available compact-disk self-pulsing lasers.  The prior success with self-pulsing lasers and the recent implementation of millimeter-wave optical transmitters using monolithic semiconductor lasers provide strong evidence for successful completion of Phase I of this effort.",

Lone Peak Engineering (LPE) has identified an opportunity to develop a solid freeform fabrication (SFF) process to manufacture functional metal components.  These metal components, prepared in a manner of hours from computer-generated models without hard tooling could be quickly shipped out as replacement parts to alleviate this supply problem.  A fully developed system could be placed in remote locations, such as onboard ships, to provide parts on an as needed basis.  This possibility could dramatically reduce the inventory of spare parts needed to maintain the Navy's ships, submarines, aircraft, and other equipment. This Phase I project will demonstrate the feasibility of using this SFF process to fabricate functional metal parts and tools from 316L stainless steel.  Lone Peak will team with United Technologies Research Center (UTRC) in this Phase I project.  During the Phase I project, United Technologies operating divisions will be surveyed for applications.  Parts for these applications will be made during the Phase H project.  Some possible applications include gears and injection molding tooling. The Phase H project will demonstrate that SFF-prepared metal parts and tools can be used in functional applications.  To achieve this goal, automated production procedures will be developed. Additional metal compositions will be examined.  Sintering to full density and hot isostatic pressing will be examined.  Machining and finishing techniques will be developed.",

Disposing of these wastes safely, economically and within environmental guidelines is a growing problem.  The accepted methods of waste treatment, such as incineration, autoclaving and shipment off-site, are the targets of increasing public concern and regulatory control.  The proposed work will evaluate the feasibility of a gaseous ozone process for converting infectious waste into more environmentally acceptable waste materials.  Ozone is attractive as a gaseous sterilant because it ie effective at low temperatures and it breaks down readily into water and oxygen so there is no undesirable liquid or gaseous effluent.  However, conventional ozone generating processes have several undesirable features including high capital costs.  The proposed sterilization process uses a fundamentally new method for making ozone offering several cost and process advantages including improved sterilant penetration qualities.  The Phase I research will evaluate the antimicrobial and sporicidal properties of this sterilization process using biological indicators and simulated medical waste. The overall goal is to develop a dual-use santitation system with environmental and cost advantages for on-site waste treatment at military and private sector hospitals.",

Before long these requirements will exceed the capabilities of batteries and a new system will be required.  Proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells have the capabilities needed to fill that need.  PEM fuel cells are capable of generating electricity efficiently, with high power to weight and power to volume rations and excellent load following.  PEM fuel cells are superior to other fuel cell types for small portable applications. The active electrolyte is a solid polymeric sheet instead of a corrosive liquid supported in a solid matrix.  The PEM stack is capable of operating at ambient temperatures and pressures and requires no preconditioning or clean-up of the air supply.  Most current fuel cell stacks require significant support hardware for air supply and fuel gas handling and humidification.  The proposed system eliminates all of this.  The use of monopolar design with an ambient air cathode has eliminated the need for an air handling system.  The use of a common hydrogen manifold for the entire stack both simplifies construction and eliminates the need for any gas handling on the fuel side beyond a step-down regulator for the hydrogen supply.

Significant potential improvements of in-service life of aircraft components are not being realized, along with the resulting cost savings, because of the inability to forcast machining costs and productivity levels. Comprehensive, accurate machining data, when accompanied by a simple, easy-to-use cost analysis enables the potential contractor to competitively bid on manufacturing aircraft components, based on his equipment, scheduling, and personnel limitations. Current efficient techniques for machinability and grindability tests provide the maximum statistically validated results with a minimum investment of testing time.

Preliminary investigations show lower animal toxicity, improvedgadolinium chelate stability and zinc transmetalation kinetics compared to several currently approvedagents. It demonstrates a two-fold improvement in liver and renal enhancement compared with currentextracellular MRI contrast agents.

What criteria should be used to base a repair or replacement decision on? In both cases, the objective is to minimize cost of new constructions or repairs of in-service ships without serious degradation to structural performance. Towards this end, reliability principles will be applied in the proposed work to develop a methodology and criteria for minimizing cost, constraint by a minimum acceptable reliability level. In Phase II of the project, alternative specifications and repair/replacement criteria will be developed based on Phase I results.

        "abstract": "Marotta Scientific Controls, Inc. has conceived a new, multi-function Xenon gas control valve concept for isolation, pressure regulation and flow control. Xenon gas propellant is used at very low flow rates in several types of next-generation electric thrusters, including the Russian Stationary Plasma Thrusters. The Multi-function control valve uses a magnetostrictive actuator. This new actuation method can operate the valve as a simple on-off valve, or it can be precisely controlled in a modulating mode to continuously regulate the pressure or flow rate of Xenon gas. It can be operated open loop, or closed loop using pressure, flow rate or another \"thrust level indicative\" signal for feedback control. For very low flow rate applications such as the Stationary Plasma Thruster, magnetostrictive materials such as \"Terfenol-D\" promise great benefits in valving. These benefits include:  1. Simplification of the system by combining on-off and regulating valves in one multi-function valve; 2. Increased reliability and increased  tolerance to contamination due to very high operating forces; 3. Simple designs, amenable to miniaturization; 4. Higher frequency response than solenoid valves; 5. Electronic adjustment of setpoint and dynamic operating characteristics.  Benefits include simplification, miniaturization, increased reliability, flexibility of operation, and elimination of redundant system hardware.  Commercial applications include commercial satellites/smallsats, ambulatory medical devices, gas chromatographs and other instruments.",

        "abstract": "The thrust to develop cleaner burning combusion systems with reduced levels of emissions (NOx and SOx) has led to a renewed interest in the exploration for the use of advanced materials in components such as pistons. Other driving forces are fuel economy, and NVH (noise vibration, and harshness). The first two (emissions and fuel economy) are government mandated while the NVH is a mandate of the marketplace. All of these driving forces and goals will ultimately affect the piston design used in the engine In gasoline engines, as well as natural gas engines, hypereutectic aluminum silicon (>12%) alloyw are normally used due to their excellent wear resistance. However, they have limitations in the overall temperature to which they can be exposed thus resulting in a limitation in the combustion temperatures in the engine. If higher temperatures are desired in future engines, advanced materials will be needed to extend these limits. Carbon-Carbon materials were developed for the aerospace industry and have historically been ignored for large volume commercial applications due to their high costs. However, in the last 5 years, the advent of a number of new processing routes to form carbon fibers has reduced the prices of production significantly and this ha resulted in the engineering viability of commercial products using these materials. C-C composites also exhibit superior mechanical properties at elevated temperatures. In this Phase I effort, MMI will demonstrate the feasibility of producing C-C pistons by developing all the manufacturing sequences necessary for commercial production. This will allow production of pistons for engine bed testing in Phase II.",

        "abstract": "An inorganic photoresist system involving only dry processing has many potential uses in microelectronic fabrication.  Reduced wafer contamination and simpler waste disposal requirements will provide a strong driving force for replacing existing wet photolithographic processes with the new system.  At the completion of this project, a new inorganic resist system utilizing hydrogenated amorphous silicon will be available to replace many of the wet chemical patterning steps used in current microelectronics, printed circuit board, and flat panel display fabrication.  The system uses only silicon and hydrogen, so there is no contamination of silicon wafers and only dry plasma processing is used for deposition and removal of the films.  Patterning of the amorphous silicon through UV enhanced oxidation will allow the use of existing exposure tools, or exposure under a partial pressure of oxygen would allow an all vacuum process.  The Phase I work will provide proof of concept for the use of amorphous silicon as a dry photoresist. Additionally, detailed design and cost estimates will be generated for a prototype PECVD module optimized for the process developed.",

MSI has used this technology to make large area 1-3 type piezoelectric ceramic/polymer composite actuator panels for use in active surface control.These are now under evaluation by the Naval Research Laboratory forthis application. In this program, MSIplans to adapt its piezoelectric composite manufacturing capability to form 1-3 and 2-2 piezocomposites that have hollow PZT elements and can be actuated at high amplitude using strain amplification. Thus, the composites can be configured for extremely high hydrostatic receiving sensitivity (similar to an end-capped array), low voltage actuation, or air-acoustic operation. The applications for such composites can thus be extended to large area hydrophones or airborne acoustic noise control. In Phase 1, MSI will extend the capabilities of its injection molding process to form hollow PZT composite strutures and then demonstrate the configurability of these devices for use in hydrodynamic flow control and air-acoustic applications.",

In one program, MSI is adapting its piezocomposite designs to fabricate transducers that couple efficiently to air or water.  In another, the company has adapted its injection molding process to form extremely fine transducer arrays, suitable for high frequency applications. In this program, MSI plans to utilize these piezoelectric composite manufacturing capabilities to form low electrical impedance 2D arrays for use in 3D ultrasonic imaging.  By multilayering the PZT ceramic elements, the electrical impedance of the small 2D PZT pillars can be drastically reduced, resulting in enhanced signal-to-noise ratio compared to monolithic array elements. The key innovation is the method used to form the multilayer array. In Phase I, MSI will demonstrate that multilayer PZT 2D transducer array structures can be made cost-effectively, and will develop a simple lab- scale demonstration array with interconnects.  In Phase II a working array will be assembled and tested in an underwater 3D imaging demonstration relevant to Navy acoustic imaging needs.",

Previous attempts to use first generation thermographic instruments showed that the results were applicable to the detection, diagnosis, and the risk assessment of breast cancer.  However, the high false positive rate of approximately 25% for detection of breast cancer with first generation thermography prevented its acceptance by the medical community.  We expect to lower the false positive rate, increase the positive predictive value and increase the negative predictive value of breast thermography by combining second generation infrared thermography, which has greater sensitivity and real time analysis, which improves the specificity.  As second generation thermographic instrumentation is brought into the medical diagnostic arena, there will be the natural expansion of its application to other types of cancer (e.g. melanoma) for risk assessment, detection, diagnosis, and a sa prognostic indicator. Creation of highly portable databases will allow patients to carry their thermographic images and image analysis results with them so that serial analysis (comparison of previous to current thermographic results) can easily be done for detection and monitoring of a wide spectrum of diseases.",

Many drugs, such ascyclosporine, are metabolized by this p450 family. The catalytic activity of p450IIIA will be estimatedfrom the rate at which a patient exhales 13CO2 after receiving an oral dose of [N,N-dimethyl-13C2]-eryt-hromycin. In previous studies, we showed that an intravenous dose of radioactive 14C-erythromycinwould be N-demethylated by P450IIIA enzymes. The production of breath 14CO2 correlated withP450IIIA levels and catalytic activity. Further research showed that the 14C-erythromycin breath testaccurately predicts cyclosporine blood levels in patients receiving different dosages. The activity ofP450IIIA varies ten fold in humans and may account for heterogeneity of cyclosporine dosingrequirements.

The clinician will utilize this information to prevent either potentially subtherapeutic orpotentially toxic dosages of cyclosporine to be administered to patients.

        "abstract": "Mortality during broiler growout still averages from 4 to 6% in the US.  Mortality and morbidity are primary sources of economic loss for poultry and livestock producers.  Control of morbidity and mortality has generally been accomplished through the use of vaccines and feed antibiotics.  In spite of these protective measures, livestock producers still suffer losses due to mortality and sub-clinical disease problems.  At least half of broiler mortality is due to unidentified factors.  It is therefore critical that the young chick's immune system has a strong start early in life.  The leucine catabolite Beta-hydroxy-Beta-methyl butyrate (HMB) has been shown to reduce mortality of broiler chickens, most of which was due to an abatement of unidentified early mortality during the first three weeks of age.  The objectives of this project would be to develop the use of HMB as an alternative to conventional drugs to control mortality in broilers.  The proposed study will use in vivo and in vitro techniques to determine if HMB improves immune function in young broiler chicks and thus, reducing unidentified mortality of the broiler chicks.  These studies would establish the basis for Phase II efficacy studies in poultry.",

Diffractive optical elements use the diffractive properties of light as opposed to refraction and reflection.  A thin film diffractive optical element which can be placed on any surface, can emulate virtually any optical component leading to considerable weight and size reduction.  MetroLaser has demonstrated that functions such as scanning, zooming, and spectral discrimination are achievable with diffractive optics and has exploited them in related problems.  Two types of diffractive optics, holographic optical elements and binary optical elements are applicable in seekers.  After a master element is constructed, additional replicas can be produced at essentially the raw material cost.  The proposal is to construct, test, and demonstrate a prototype sensor employing diffractive optics that operate in the IR band and that advantageously replace existing seeker optics. The proposal shows that a considerable commercial potential exists for such optics.",

Environment tools will optimize the appli- cation for the specified architecture and automatically generate executable appli- cation code. Run-time support will provide efficient, real-time application execution. Command program and execution monitor run-time interfaces will be supported. A GUI command interface will support interactive graph control as an alternative to command programs. The execution monitor will provide a \"virtual oscilloscope\" capability to interact with application data. Exporting data to and importing data to/from other tools will support interactive use of PGM and other analysis and display tools. The PGM workstation environment will be portable to workstations and PCs with Unix support. Translation support for new DSPs is easily added to the environment. Run-time support is readily ported to new architectures.

These jets consist of an inner glass capillary tube with a precision-formed orifice surrounded by a piezoelectric outer wall that contracts when activated electronically.

        "abstract": "The collection of sufficient quantities of truly representative ambient samples (e.g., air, water) for analysis is a serious problem with any mobile air sampling and monitoring system. There are several ways this problem can be addressed. The approach proposed in tihs SBIR is twofold. First, a chemical detector with very high sensitivity and selectivity will be designed to reduce the volume of sample required. Second, the size, volume, cost, and power consumption will be reduced to the point where it will be feasible to deploy an array of detectors throughouth an area to assure more representative sampling. The chemical detectors will be capable of coninous, automatic, remote operation and will interface with a control/data acquisition network via hardwire or RF communication links. The new, high performance chemical detector will be based on solid state surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices, which are very small, low cost, rugged, low power, and highly sensitive chamical detectors. The practical ilimitation of present SAW sensors is their limited chemical sslectivity. The technical approach of Phase I, therefore, will be make a major improvement in selectivity, specifically by placing a miniature GC column ahead of a muliple SAW sensor array. It is projected that the performance of such a SAW Array/GC unit will approach that of a mass spectrometer, but at a fraction of the size, cost, and complexity. The projected SAW/GC system will also be evaluated for minimum size, weight, cost, complexity, maintenance, and power consumption, as well as transportability. Anticipated Benefits: The new SAW Array/GC is designed specifically to meet US requirements for a small, high performance, highly portable, automatic chemical monitor that can be readily deployed anywhere in the world. However, because of it's unique performance capablities and many palnned user options it is also expected to meet many industrial and environmental chemical detection/monitoring requirements. The SAW Array/GC chemical monitor is thus expected to have a significant commercial market.",

        "abstract": "Vibration suppression/rejection is important for many space system attitude controls. Structural vibration of solar arrays and instrumentation booms can significantly degrade the performance of attitude control systems and reduce the accuracy of scientific instrumentations. In establishing effective attitude control, the effect of disturbance loads due to the structural vibration must be measured. An innovative approach to measuring the structural response is the use of area averaging sensors. Spatially distributed sensors constructed from an intelligent polymer film represent a viable, practical alternative for obtaining measurements for the control purpose. These sensors are lightweight, durable, highly sensitive, and they can also be shaped to provide innovative spatial filtering not obtainable with conventional sensors. This Phase I proposal will fully innovate and develop these attractive properties of area averaging sensors and apply these sensors to attitude control of space system with flexible solar arrays and instrumentation booms. Phase II will design (in detail), fabricate and test a prototype of the proposed sensor. Inexpensive area averaging sensors are ideal for a number of commercial applications, including high speed disk-head control, gust alleviation, flutter suppression, vibration suppression/isolation, and helicopter higher harmonic control. Establishing area averaging sensors as a practical and proven engineering solution would help reduce design costs while enabling higher performance.",

The proposed device is similar to a radome with an array of active radiating elements embedded inside, or on the surface, of the composite structure.  Two methods of exciting the elements will be investigated:  1) Simultaneously excite all elements of the array to produce a steerable plane wave illumination of the antenna under test, 2) Excite only one element at a time which produces spherical wave illumination on the antenna under test.  Also two different types of arrays and feed networks will be investigated during Phase I of this program:  1) microstrip fed slots and 2) electrically short dipole elements fed by balanced two-wire feed lines.  The feed lines are intentionally mismatched to the radiating elements such that the RF coupler does not disrupt externally impressed incident fields.  The results of Phase I is a detailed design which will be ready for fabrication and testing in phase II.",

The antenna technology proposed has been proven to work for Low Observable (LO) aircraft applications.  The proposed utilization for chamber operation will involve design simplification and low cost construction.  Beam width and beam direction are readily controlled since the antenna is an array.  Costs can be controlled by using routine printed circuit etching technology to produce repeatable, accurate feed network on a single layer.  Beam control can be achieved by an inexpensive switch network on each array column or row by a space feed.  The low RCS aspects of the antenna design are achieved by carefully controlling array element input impedance for a wide range of scan angles by using compensating dielectric layers.  Potential feed network returns are controlled by including integral hybrids in the etched as part of the feed network.  both structural and antenna mode scattering are controlled by this array configuration.  Array edges must be carefully blended into the surrounding chamber absorber.  This concept has been proven to exhibit low RCS and dependable antenna performance over a 4:1 bandwidth.",

The objective of Phase I of this project is to demonstrate the innovative applicatin of a filterless heat exchanger precleaner for use by military and commercial vehicles. This method relies on the use of guide vanes to impart a swirling motion ot the air for subsequent separation of the contaminates. A rapid swirling motion of the air allows quick and efficient removal of dust and fluids from the air with a small drop in pressure. Guide vanes can be arranged in a matrix and fabricated using injection molding processes to save space and reduce fabrication cost. The proposed method also offers high reliability, low maintenance cost, and easy integration with present and future vehicles.

We will develop and evaluate a unique, computer-based interactive training system for teaching brain monitoring. The goal is to teach nurses to recognize basic changes in the EEG which, if brought to the attention of physicians, could improve patient outcome. The system is based on a novel electronic EEG generator developed by the company. The generator will be interfaced to a personal computer so that EEG waveforms can be synchronized with an interactive multi-media course on the computer.

This will result in a speed up in the formulation of a sound chemical rationale for the biochemical behavior of these drugs. Both the information gathered and the software methodologies developed will be of great scientific and commercial interest.

        "abstract": "This Phase I SBIR project will demonstrate the feasibility of an innovative computational tool for the development of new materials. It has always been the goal of computational chemistry to predict the formation, behavior and properties of a molecule before it is synthesized in the laboratory.  While considerable progress has been made, severe computational limitations still inhibit a global solution approach.  At one extreme, the quantum codes are needed to predict electronic and optical properties; at the other, molecular mechanics tools are necessary to determine thermal and mechanical characteristics.  As long as these extremes are largely uncoupled, the codes are generally useful.   Where localized quantum effects drive major macromolecular conformation changes, as in photon absorption by bacteriorhodopsin, conventional codes become inadequate.  Recent algorithmic developments by Moldyn, based on aggregation approaches, will however, respond to these needs.  Multigranularity is already inherent in aggregation, and the primary task is to include the quantum capability in that formalism.  In Phase I, the method will be demonstrated using existing codes - the quantum and atomistic capabilities in CHARMM combined with the aggregation approaches within MBO(N)D.  Bacteriorhodopsin will be the test example.  In Phase II, the prototype of an end-to-end multigranular code will be assembled.",

        "abstract": "Focal plane arrays (FPAs) are one of the most critical and expensive components in infrared imaging equipment, such as nigh vision, security and surveillance systems.  In the device manufacturing processes, at present, it is not possible to determine if the final product is successful until all steps and materials have been incorporated.  Since this entire manufacturing process can take up to 12 weeks to complete, much time and effort is spent on components which may ultimately prove to be defective.  Current defect rates are in the order of 80% and are attributed to defective FPA chips/die.  As a consequence, the availability of fully functional FPA modules is limited, and the price of those produced is unacceptably high.  The Hall effect technique, particularly in conjunction with the van der Pauw theorem, is the most frequently used method of screening chips.  In this technique at least four electrical ohmic contacts must be made to the semiconductor.  This technique is labor intensive and frequently causes mechanical and electrical problems that result in inaccurate and non-repeatable results or damage. Furthermore, the measurement of carrier concentration as a function of position on the slice (mapping) is impossible since the Hall technique provides only the average value of the carrier concentration for area enclosed by the electrical contacts.  For detector arrays, carrier concentration uniformity or doping homogeneity is necessary for uniform array operations.  Any nonuniformity in the starting material would show up as a nonuniformity in the detectivity of each pixel in the detector array.  The approach described in this proposal requires no physical contacts, is not labor intensive and can map electronic properties, such as carrier concentration and mobility, of a chip with high spatial resolution thereby identifying small areas of electronic nonuniformity that could not otherwise be found by conventional screening methods.  This is accomplished by utilizing the Faraday rotation effect.",

Previous studies have shown that, unlike many other types of liquid immersion concepts, the thermal performance of the proposed concept is more sensitive to coolant velocity than to flow rate. Thus, performance can be greatly enhanced by reducing jet width (in order to increase jet velocity) without increasing the coolant flow rate. Key features of the proposed jet impingement concept are its ultra high heat dissipation capabilities, up to 660 Watts per device using FC-72, small pressure drop and simplicity of design and fabrication. The key objectives of the proposed project are disigning a single multi-jet manifolding plate which can be accommodated within the geometrical constraints of avionics cooling modules, modeling the development of vapor bubbles on the device surface (to establish design guidelines for preventing dryout and ensuring complete condensation of the bubbles prior to exiting the module), and designing the module itself, maximizing the use of commercially available hardware.",

        "abstract": "This project will develop a new class of affordable advanced airborne sensors based on innovative signal processing techniques applied to wideband radar and SAR imaging. As a case study, we consider the problem of classification and localization of buried objects such as metallic and non-metallic mines. However, this work is broadly applicable and represents an important step towards developing a suite of new avionic sensors to perform (eventually) long-distance surgical mapping of buried assets. This project will develop the requisite algorithms and demonstrate their performance with Navy supplied data. As an option, we will provide a prototype system design that can be built and tested in Phase II. Underscoring this effort are advanced high-order signal processing (HOSP) methods which are capable of increasing signal-to-noise/clutter ratios and enhancing SAR resolution, thus improving detection and localization of targets-of-interest. Recent results on material characterization obtained by MultiSpec using HOSP and ultra-wideband radar, will be adapted to this application framework. The Phase I objectives of this project are: (1) development of HOSP-based algorithms for SAR subsurface imaging and demonstration of enhanced performance in detection, and localization of closely spaced buried mines using synthetic data; (2) demonstration of the efficacy of these techniques with Navy-supplied data; (3) exploration of material characterization capabilities of these HOSP-based radar and SAR techniques; (4) prototype system design for implementation in Phase II (option).",

        "abstract": "Ultra-Wideband (UWB) signals, much like conventional spread spectrum waveforms, minimize intercepts from unintended receivers by generating negligible amounts of energy within the intercept receiver's acquisition bandwidth. Unlike spread spectrum, UWB spread bandwidth is generated directly, not by modulation with a spreading sequence. UWB is essentially a time-domain concept in which an extremely short pulse generates an extremely wide bandwidth signal because of the Fourier transform relationship between time and frequency. MSSI, teamed with ANRO, has recently completed a very successful SBIR Phase I program where feasibility was demonstrated for a covert 1 Mb/s UWB data link that could be combined with an altimeter for a Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) application. It was shown that the simplicity of a UWB avionics package permits the development of a singel, common module capable of performing communciations, altimeter, obstacle avoidance, data link and transponder position/recovery functions, all at low cost and system complexity. Advances in imulse, or UWB technology, made by MSSI and ANRO over the past 10 years now provide a firm foundation for further system application development, primarily extending data rates to 100 Mb/s and apparent center frequency to 30 GHz. Anticipated Benefits: UWB technology offers LPI/LPD performance, but at significant cost and reliability advantages to conventional systems. Due to its digital nature, UWB systems are small, lighweight, inexpensive, extremely accurate, and very reliable. Application areas include altimetry, obstacle avoidance radar, data links (military and commercial), and transponder/position recovery.",

        "abstract": "There is an increasing need for an innovative technology for low cost recovery and recycling of heavy metals found in industrial wastewater streams.  Target heavy metals include elements such as chromium, nickel, cadmium, lead, copper, and zinc.  Existing wastewater treatment technologies such as bioremediation can neither biodegrade heavy metals, nor can they decontaminate them. Other conventional alternatives such as ion-exchange and precipitation are too expensive to be commercially viable and they create another hazardous waste.  This program seeks to explore, develop and commercialize an alternative technology with the potential of profitably recovering and recycling heavy metals.  The proposed technology is based on photocatalyzed redox recovery of metals over nanosized catalysts.  The proposed technology has many desirable features:  photoreduction on nanocatalysts is fast and works with solar energy; the use of nanocatalysts significantly enhances the process efficiency; the nanocatalysts can also simultaneously and completely mineralize organic and non-metallic pollutants that may be present in the wastewater (broadband treatment agent).",

        "abstract": "Global production and use of ceramic capacitors exceeds several hundred million units per day. With the projected growth in demand for more demanding electronic products, electronic vehicles and related technologies, the need for more reliable, higher energy density, higher power density, higher breakdown strength, efficient ceramic capacitors can not be overstated. Multilayered ceramic capacitors have the potential of meeting these needs. However, their performance is limited by the fact that the thickness of each layer cannot be lowered below about 5-10u as the multilayered structure is presently produced from micron-sized ceramic powders. Phase I seeks to explore and demonstrate that this problem may be overcome with the use of nano-powders (particle size 1 to 100 nanometers) of ceramics. Nano-powders can yield dielectric thickness that are more than an order of magnitude lower than the best achievable today, yet enhance the breakdown stress, the mechanical and thermal robustness. The projected energy density of nanoceramics-based multilayered capacitor is 5-15 J/cc which is more than 10 fold higher than the best conventional multilayered ceramic capacitors. Phase I will establish the proof-of-concept, while Phase II will seek to optimize, produce and field test prototype nanostructured capacitors. The multilayered capacitors have applications in portable energy sources, pulsed power armament, electronic components used by the BMDO. The technology has dual-use applications in electric and hybrid electric vehicles, vehicle start up circuits and portable energy components.",

Further, at a recent NIH-sponsored conference on menopause (March 1993), one of therecommendations was that health professionals need to be provide with the skills to help counsel womwomen in decision making about menopause management. We will develop a detailed design for the produROM program for health professionals which will provide a comprehensive, up-to-date source of informon the issues of menopause and hormone replacement therapy. The CD-ROM, designed as a CME accreditedprovide a rich source of background material and research data on menopause and hormone replacementpractitioners to learn ways of working with women to help them make decisions. The high degree of fland control allowed by CD-ROM technology will allow for sophisticated self-tests, the presentation oeducational vignettes, and production of informational packets customized for patients. Based on yeaexperience on menopause from the acclaimed Massachusetts Women's Health Study, the investigators arequalified to develop this program. The specific aims of this Phase I application are to develop a defor the CD-ROM in collaboration with content providers and CD-ROM producers; to develop a distributicollaboration with a qualified CD-ROM producer and distributor; to initiate CME accreditation for thwith consultants to optimize the content, interface, and subject matter of the disc; and  to developwhich the disc content will be finalized and the disc will be produced and evaluated.",

We propose to develop an easy-to-use, accurate, and environmentally safe nitrate test kit based on the enzyme nitrate reductase isolated from corn leaves.  The kit will be designed for home and farm use.  Technical challenges in kit development are: 1) formulation of an enzyme-based kit for home use; and 2) simplifying evaluation of test results.  Our objectives are to assemble an effective and easy-to-use nitrate test kit and to study new ways to quantify nitrate tests results without expensive or complicated devices.  NECi has a significant competitive advantage in our proprietary technique for purifying nitrate reductase in a stable form.

Unfortunately, low cost tages are handicapped by read-only capabilities. This limits their potential applications base, particularly in private/secure communications areas, where the ability to periodically rewrite a security code is desirable. Magnetoresistive Random Access Memory (MRAM) is the ideal Read/Write memory for inclusion on RFID tags because it requires a lower write energy than any other nonvolatile memory technology. This allows energy from the RF transmission to be used for writing, as well as reading the memory cells. In addition, the magnetic materials used in the MRAM memory cells are available during routine inductor (antennae), obviating the need for an add-on device, and reducing RFID tag cost. This proposed work will result in the fabrication of a high quality on chip inductor, fabrication of low energy MRAM memory cells, design of a low cost, writeable RFID tag using the inductor and the MRAM memory cells, and design of an RFID Reader/Writer for integating the tag information into a wireline communications network.

They are currently used in automobile distributors and anti-skid braking systems, and are proposed for vehicle location (wheel sensor) in IVHS systems. The utility and performance of these sensors is critically dependent on magnetic field sensitivity. This development applies Giant Magneto-resistance Ratio (GMR) materials (which were initially developed for radiation hard memories) to magentic field sensors for use in vehicles and for vehicle sensing. These materials have magnetoresistances of three to 30 times the magnetoresistances of common materials used today.

The holographic coating can be used on any optical surface and used alone can reduce unwanted reflections to a fraction of one percent. A holographic coating can be fabricated to be narrow bandwidth (5-50 nm) or extremely broadband. Used in conjunction with conventional antireflection coatings a surface may be made virtually reflection free. Broadband antireflection coatings currently do not exist and are a major priority for manufacturers such as Libby-Owens-Ford (LOF). This is a new technology addressing an old problem. This technology is applicable to literally dozens of commercial applications. Anywhere unwanted reflection exists a simple coating to reduce or eliminate that reflection is appropriate. Applications include: computer monitors or television screens, framed pictures, solar concentrators and collectors, windows of all kinds, solar cells, focal plane systems, etc.",

        "abstract": "Ten years ago large software systems were on the order of hundreds of thousands of lines of code.  Today's large software systems are order of magnitude larger.  With computer hardware becoming faster with each successive generation, more technically complex problems are being solved in software.  The growth in complexity and size of these software systems have led to problems in testing and manageability of the software.  Visual programming provides a way to reduce the complexity of software.  Visual programming reduces the size of a software system from millions of lines of code to tens of thousands of visual elements.  It does this by encapsulating primitive functionality of code within graphical objects and allows the programmer position the icon, tying each programming icon together with a specified interface.  By using an icon-driven, graphical drag-and-drop metaphor popularized by some of the current visual programming tools, the software development environment will be usable by nonprogrammers. To provide flexibility and expressiveness, the development environment will be built on top of a flexible scaffolding allowing the software designer to add or replace items within this scaffolding.  This is accomplished by using a state-of-the-art programming metaphor called component programming.",

The innovations we propose willsubstantially improve microchannel plates (MCPs) as detectors of high mass biomolecular ions. This willbe accomplished through implementation of three separate developments: (1) reducing the MCP surfacework function, to increase ion-electron and ion-ion conversion yields leading to improved signal-to-noiseratios (2) enhancing the grazing incidence geometry for incident primary ions through use of a novelsquare channel geometry, also resulting in increased ion-electron and ion-ion yields: and (3) substantiallyimproving MCP detector dynamic range, which has recently been a limiting factor in analyzing heavierbiomolecules in matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI). Any one of these improvementswould be considered a worthy incremental enhancement in MCP performance. We will implement allthree simultaneously in the same MCP detector; the result would be a radical departure in theperformance of high mass ion detectors. If this is done, MCP detectors will quickly assume the leadingrole in high mass ion detection in the 50,000 to 1 MegaDalton mass range--just as they are now wellestablished as the leading detectors for low mass ions.",

Ferroelectric oxides are intrinsically fast response materials, and suitable for low voltage operation because of their large electro-optic (E-O) coefficients.  However, these high figure of merit materials have not been utilized for practical SLM applications because of the difficulties in obtaining high quality materials.  Epitaxial vapor phase growth is an alternative approach to fabricating large area single-crystalline films.  In this Phase I, NZ Applied Technologies and Prof. R.A. Chipman of the University of Alabama in Huntsville propose to demonstrate the feasibility of using thin films of BaTio3 and PLZT, with the largest E-O coefficients known, for SLM fabrication.  The optical quality, single-crystalline films will be epitaxially grown by an innovative plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PE-CVD).  The PE-CVD is suited for SLMs due to its large-area, low temperature, high growth rate, and low cost fabrication capabilities.  The basic modulator performance of the proposed materials will be determined by a novel Mueller Matrix Imaging method.  In Phase II, the materials will be optimized, and prototype devices will be produced.",

The proposed solution utilizes the concept of Hydropiezoelectricity whereby thin plastic sheets of piezo material(PVDF) are employed to directly convert the large available mechanical energy to electrical power for charging the battery cache. The proposed Phase I effort consists of analysis and simulation tasks designed to determine both the technical and economic feasibility of the approach in typical shallow and deep ocean environments.

        "abstract": "Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), a disease affecting millions of individuals worldwide, has a high incidence of patient mortality. The etiological agent of this disease, the infectious retrovirus HIV-l, has proven refractory to therapeutic intervention. The drugs used in the clinic today only target the viral reverse transcriptase. At best, such drugs temporarily delay disease progression. In addition, these agents exhibit significant toxicity at the effective therapeutic dose. Presently, other compounds targeting reverse transcriptase, viral protease, or the viral Tat trans-activator are also in clinical trials. However, it appears clear that additional drugs may be needed which target other steps in viral replication. One such target is the Rev trans-activator, which is essential for viral replication. The function of Rev is to induce-nuclear export of the partially spliced and unspliced viral messages, which encode the structural gene products and the RNA genome, for infectious HIV-1 particles. We propose to create a Rev-dependent, double reporter assay combined with Oncogene Science's unique cell based high-throughput screening technology, which is capable of evaluating over 123,000 compounds per year, to identify lead compounds which specifically inhibit the HIV-1 Rev trans-activator.",

        "abstract": "The control of multidrug resistant tuberculosis has been severely hampered by the lack of rapid methods for antimicrobial susceptibility testing and diagnosis of mycobacterial infection. The research provides a novel approach to rapid antibiotic susceptibility testing; the testing will be based on One Cell Systems' proprietary microdrop technology. Individual mycobacterial microcolonies will be encapsulated and grown within a very small cloning region defined by a gel microdrop (GMD). Automated analysis of GMDs by flow cytometry following clonal growth and fluorescent staining of the organisms forms the basis of this assay system. Susceptibility of mycobacteria to antibiotics has been detected in 5 days using the GMD- clonal growth method, thus, demonstrating the basic feasibility of this approach. The goals of the Phase I research are to develop quantitative methods for evaluation of mycobacterial growth and resistance to antimicrobial agents. These experiments will form the basis for a commercially viable, rapid mycobacterial assay system, utilizing conventional methods at a microscale. The re-emergence of tuberculosis as a public health problem in the United States points to the urgent need for such a testing system.",

We will develop E. coli Ol57:H7antiverotoxin using proprietary methods for the large-scale production of therapeutic polyclonalantibodies from eggs of hyperimmune hens.

We shall implement an innovative external technique to introduce and control a halp-pi phase shift into the middle of the grating and this would allow only a single frequency to exist at the Bragg wavelength. Phase I will prove the feasibility of the idea, which will be very easy to control and use in large scale manufacturing. Producing the required shift by writing two different gratings has not been attempted and may well prove to be very difficult. With further development in Phase II, this practical, rugged and low-cost fiber laser will have the following characteristics: true single longitudinal mode, high powers in the 50-100 mW range, low relative intensity noise, very narrow linewidth in the tens of kilohertz range. This DFB fiber laser will have a better frequency stability than either a semiconductor diode laser or a distributed Bragg-end-reflector fiber laser because of its increased side-mode separation and suppression. Further, packaging will be easy because fiber lasers are simple and fiber-compatible, and output powers can be scaled up with the pump power and by making the fiber more efficient.

There are two innovative aspects in our proposal: the incorporation of commercially available very high power, not necessarily single mode, semiconductor laser diodes as pump sources; and, a novel single mode fiber, doped with the appropriate rare earth ions. The pump power can be efficiently coupled into and absorbed by the specially coated fiber. This approach is being tried here for the first time. The greatest advantage of our high power fiber laser product will be its enhanced mechanical stability compared to the solid state lasers, which use bulk optical components. Compared with other double clad fiber lasers which use thin films deposited at fiber ends as mirrors, our fiber lasers with Bragg fiber filters are highly resistant to thermal damage. Also, the fiber laser products will be easier to integrate with optical fiber delivery systems than other double clad lasers, and lasers which use crystal based hosts as the gain medium. The one micron fiber lasers have potential applications as superfluorescent sources, and in sensors and lidar. The tunable laser is particularly attractive for spectroscopic applications.

        "abstract": "This proposal deals with the application of advanced mathematical concepts for developing a general purpose, fire detection and suppression system that can be adapted for residential, commercial, and industrial environments.  The system utilizes a suite of common (or future) sensors that are networked; it employs a distributed control strategy with local \"intelligence,\" and uses advanced data and information fusion techniques; this is not a sensor \"voting\" rule.  The Intelligent Fire Control (IFC) system offers improved reliability via redundancy, cross validation and triangulation.  The IFC also offers greater robustness and is less vulnerable to failures in a single sensor or in a control console.  While based on existing sensor hardware, continuous monitoring of the sensors' output allows the control algorithms to utilize the sonsors' proportional output rather than a fixed set-point (threshold) control.  By continuously performing situational assessment before, during, and after a fire event, the IFC is capable, via event-anticipation, of providing high sensitivity with a low false alarm rate.  Furthermore, the IFC is designed to continuously select/deselect necessary fire abatement means for most effective suppression while avoiding unnecessary damage due to water, etc.  The capability for autonomous self inspection, fault detection, and fault tolerance via redundancy or compensation (for a faulty sensor) is built into the system.\n\nThe Phase I objectives are to demonstrate (i) the feasibility of such a system via controlled lab experiments, and (ii) a higher detection probability at a lower false alarm rate than a system based on a set-point threshold with a discrete sensor.

Preliminary analysis indicates that remote sensing using thermal infrared imaging spectroscopy is an effective technology for the detection and identification of various hazardous sustances controlled under the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendment, and illicuit drugs and chemical weapons manufacturing facilities. 2) Under the Visiting Investigator Program, OKSI and NASA Stennis Space Center will jointly conduct market/technology and end-user requirements/commercialization analyses. A major dual-use aspect of the technology relates to hyperspectral automated target recognition, and to mapping and geographical information systems. Anticipated Benefits: Imaging spectroscopy applications are growing at an explosive rate. The proposed technology will lead to the establishment of the first commercial service providing imaging spectroscopy in the thermal infrared. Applications include environmental monitoring (superfund site monitoring, rapid response for monitoring accidental spills and releases), law enforcement (search for illicit drugs production facilities), and geological, soil and plant studies.",

        "abstract": "Control of vortices on the leading edge of an airfoil has the potential to decrease drag and increase lift by decreasing the pressure on the forward facing and upper airfoil surfaces.  A novel microactuator is proposed which allows for arbitrarily large displacements to be achieved.  The actuator is also mechanically robust as compared to \"conventional\" silicon-based microactuators.  Large arrays of the actuators can be deployed in order to obtain fine control of the boundary layer, without a large weight penalty which is typical of macroscopic systems.  The system will allow for the elimination of fixed stall fences and vortex generators, thereby eliminating the drag which they induce during most flight regimes.  The anticipated effects may be great enough to allow the elimination or the reduction of traditional flight control devices such as rudders and ailerons, when used in a laterally asymmetrical configurations.  The program will accomplish four objectives.  The principal of microactuator controlled vortex generation will be demonstrated in a wind tunnel.  Scale-up and implementation factors will be evaluated.  A simplified microactuator system will be designed and fabricated to demonstrate the feasibility of implementing the novel microactuator.  Finally, preliminary design of a complete system will be performed to prepare for, and help ensure the success of Phase II and Phase III programs.",

The Fiber Optic Rotation Mini-Sensor (FORMS) will also implement fiber optics in such a manner that the sensor will be EMI immune, and smaller than other currently available rotation sensors. The combination of accuracy, stability, reliability, and durability, along with previously stated advantages, of the proposed sensor will demonstrate its superiority over any other currently available rotation sensor. The anticipated accuracy will rival that of commonly used optical encoders. The technology proposed will allow for implementation of this sensor into any system that currently uses a rotation sensor or has a rotation joint, with little or no impact to joint size. Currently perceived applications include: aircraft control surface positions, aircraft door and panel positions, aircraft and launch vehicle thrust control devices, spacecraft antenna and instrument pointing, rotation control knobs, and many commercial applications in areas of biomedicine and consumer products. Anticipated Benefits: The Fiber Optic Rotation Mini-Sensor (FORMS) will provide a small, light-weight, accurate, EMI-immune, miniature rotation sensor for aircraft control surfaces, thrust vector monitors, control and instrumental knobs, other aircraft/spacecraft applications, and many commercial non-aircraft applications.

        "abstract": "Electrophoresis can resolve thousands of proteins, but analysis of such data is extremely difficult. Automated methods for detection and recognition of proteins on two-dimensional (2D) electrophoretograms are needed. Image processing techniques and expert systems have been tried, but these are computationally intensive, require heuristic rule bases, and cannot identify proteins from analysis of their constituent polypeptide chains. Artificial neural networks are easy to train and implement, and they should correctly categorize an almost unlimited number of proteins by their distinctive polypeptide patterns. We will develop a protein identification system based on neural net recognition of polypeptide distribution in 2D electrophoretograms. Phase I research will develop a demonstration system to examine electrophoretograms of an unknown protein and identify it. The effort is an extension of successful neural net research by ORINCON in such diverse fields as biomedical diagnostics, underwater acoustics, and fault detection. Phase II will incorporate data fusion techniques and an expanded set of known proteins to enable analysis of entire 2D electrophoresis biological samples. This would lead to development of a commercial package for automated protein analysis of 2D electrophoretograms. It easily could be modified to categorize other constituents (e. g., amino and nucleic acids) simply by retraining the net.",

In particular, we are addressing the JOINT STARS mission that exploits integration of off-board sources such as unmanned serial vehicles (UAVs), airborne warning and control systems (AWACS), and RIVET JOINT. This is one of the goals of the Off-board Augmented Theater Surveillance program at Rome Laboratory.  The innovative fusion concepts we propose to design and develop are:  1) noncooperative target sensor registration (NCTSR) to handle off-board reports/tracks that are biased from truth due to unknown platform and sensor alignment errors; 2) the ability to process time correlated track reports that are sent over to the fusion node from an off-board tracking system; and 3) the development of a Bayesian classification algorithm to exploit parameter attribute and classification clues from various reporting systems.    Each of these designs will be integrated into an existing multiple hypothesis tracking (MHT) algorithm that has been developed at ORINCON over a period of 10 years.  The final integrated MRT design will then undergo preliminary testing against Rome Laboratory-approved test scenarios that are representative of JOINT STARS missions.  Results and recommendations will then be summarized in a final test report.",

They are attractive for commercial and military high performance applications because size and weight is reduced while reliability is increased. The adhesives utilized in these circuits play a central role in determining the reliability of the rigid-flex circuit. Meeting the thermomechanical stress requirements of military and complex commercial applications is a problem with current adhesives. Several hurdles exist: inadequate bond strengths after thermal cycling, inadequate flexibility where thermal cycling is required, low resistance to decomposition, low dielectric strengths, large Z-axis coefficients of thermal expansion, moisture absorption, low resistance to chemical attack and high costs. This proposal entails the development of new flexible co-polymer adhesives based on newly discovered polyester oligimers which can have higher bond strengths, higher operating and decomposition temperatures, lower coefficients of thermal expansion, and higher flexibility. The adhesives should retain superior properties, even under sever thermal and environmental conditions and should be processable by established processes and equipment. The Phase I objective is to prove the principle of a multifunctional epoxy polyester oligimer co-polymers to bond laminate components of a rigid-flex circuit together. OPTION: $20,008",

It is desirable to monitor to 100%, O2 cylinder gas, which is used at high altitude and as a back-up supply in case of OBOGS failure. Oxigraf proposes to use laser diode absorption spectroscopy in the visible spectrum to monitor oxygen concentration.  The Oxigraf sensor in development for the past five years measures oxygen concentration in medical environments from 5 to 100% with +- 0.2% accuracy with fast 0.1 second response.  This sensor can be perfected in Phase I to measure at aircraft altitude and be insensitive to vibration.  In Phase II, the mean time between maintenance of the sensor can be extended from 1,000 to perhaps 15,000 hours using available improved laser diodes.  In addition, aircraft packaging, electronic interfacing, and thermal, vibration, and other environmental testing can be achieved.  In Phase III< Normalair-Garrett of Yeovil, England, an established supplier of aircraft oxygen systems, is prepared to pursue adoption on military aircraft systems provided the technology is perfected as proposed. A letter of support is attached on page 23 of this proposal.",

        "abstract": "Improvement in the quality, size and cost of cadmium zinc telluride, (Cd,Zn)Te, substrates is necessary in order to realize the high performance benefits of HgCdTe based infrared devices. To meet this need we propose an innovative feedback control strategy for vertical Bridgman (VB) crystal growth. Using a computational heat flow model we will formulate a control algorithm that will be coupled with a novel means for manipulating the heat flow during crystal growth. The problem area we are addressing is the ability to actively control the crystal/melt interface shape in the VB configuration to maintain a flat or slightly convex (with respect to the liquid) profile. By doing so, it will be possible to grow crystals with larger diameters and lower defect densities since the potential for stacking faults, twinning and stresses due to radial thermal gradients will be reduced. To achieve the goal of high quality (Cd,Zn)Te growth we have assembled a team that combines state-of-the-art heat flow modeling capabilities, crystal growth experience, and thermal hardware design expertise. Our approach implements a logical developmental process that will lead to the production of improved (Cd,Zn)Te substrates. Anticipated Benefits: There is a constant need to establish more robust manufacturing processes in several areas of IR detector production. The goals presented in this proposed research relate directly to achieving better quality substrate materials which is fundamental to improving overall IR detector producibility and reliability.",

        "abstract": "Current ultrasound images in mine warfare, biomedical imaging and non-destructive testing are limited by the use of linear transducer arrays which result in thick image \"slices\", errors from phase aberrations and primitive volumetric scanning capability.  Two-dimensional arrays will overcome these limitations. Two-dimensional arrays have not been manufactured because of difficulty in fabricating the small structures and low transducer element sensitivity.  The low sensitivity can be overcome by employing multi-layer structures. We propose an innovative, scaleable approach to manufacture low-cost, two-dimensional, multi-layer transducer arrays with low impedance and high sensitivity.  Our approach uses plasma-enhanced, reactive Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD) to deposit high- quality, perovskite lead-zirconate lead-titanate (PZT) films as the piezoelectric material and photolithogrpahy with PVD and an innovative, manufacturing scheme to provide the interlayer electrodes and element interconnections. In Phase I, we will demonstrate the feasibility of the approach by fabricating a two-dimensional, multi-layered array and measuring its impedance characteristics and acoustic performance. In Phase II, we will build fully populated two-dimensional, multi-layered imaging arrays and test them for element sensitivity, interelement isolation, electrical impedance and beamforming performance and use them to form three-dimensional images.",

The proposed system will tap the large quantities of waste hat from the intercooler of gas turbine engines and use a Rankine cycle to increase the power of core gas turbine, or to drive an electric generator to power auxiliary systems.  The innovative aspect of this thermal management system is to employ Creare's advanced component technology for compact heat exchangers and high-efficiency turbomachines to minimize the size and weight of the energy recovery system.  For aerospace thermal management applications, Creare has developed very compact, high flux heat exchangers which can be used to gather heat from the intercooler as well as to boil and condense the working fluid.  Creare has also developed turbomachinery and systems for aerospace applications in which advanced fabrication techniques enable small size and high efficiency, and non-contact bearings give simplicity and high reliability.  By integrating these advanced technology components, we will develop a lightweight, small volume energy recovery system for gas turbine engines. during Phase I we will select a engine, perform sizing and design studies to develop conceptual designs, select an efficient bottoming cycle based upon our advanced component technology, and prepare a plan to test the system in Phase II.   We will develop this technology for commercial applications for various transportation systems on land, sea, and air, including passenger vehicles with internal combustion engines to improve fuel economy.",

PDRI proposes an innovative approach to criterion development for use by AF researchers.  During the proposed Phase I SBIR effort, we plan to begin development of two sets of criterion measures.  The first set will be designed to link predictor scores directly to their training or job performance analog, thus providing evidence for construct validity using an external construct validation strategy. A second set of technical proficiency performance measures will be constructed and presented in a computerized adaptive rating format, which will help raters to provide more precise, accurate criterion performance scores.  Workshops will be held with subject matter experts to review predictor constructs, target possible analog performance measures for both the training and job settings, and generate critical incidents of effective and ineffective performance.  Our Phase I efforts will conclude with the development and presentation of a demonstration of the new computerized adaptive rating scale technology.",

        "abstract": "We will develop significantly improved automated techniques for detecting the most commonly occurring cytogenetic abnormalities in interphase cells obtained by amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling (CVS). Using DNA probes on interphase cells avoids the culturing required for routine cytogenetic analysis. This will reduce the time and cost of prenatal diagnosis and permit extension of the test to a larger segment of the at-risk population. Automation will be particularly important when fetal cells can be isolated from maternal blood samples. This would eliminate the risk of amniocentesis or CVS and extend fetal aneuploidy screening to virtually all pregnancies. We will use fluorescent DNA probe labeling and automated image analysis to quantify the numbers of chromosomes 21, 18, 13, X, and Y in interphase cells. Aneuploidies of these five chromosomes occur in approximately 2% of all prenatal diagnostic tests done for \"advanced maternal age\", and they account for the great majority of all viable cytogenetic abnormalities observed at amniocentesis or CVS. Rapid aneuploidy screening and sex determination will also assist situations involving newborns with multiple congenital anomalies or ambiguous genitalia, suggesting possible trisomy. Interphase cell analysis by in situ hybridization could provide a diagnosis in under 24 hours; a considerable difference compared to the 48-72 hours for conventional cytogenetics done on peripheral blood and 10-14 days for amniocentesis or CVS.",

PHI proposes to meet these needs with a novel Raman Scattering and Flourescence instrument using a diode laser and a charge coupled device (CCD) or avalanche photodiode (APD) detector. The instrument selects the Raman or Fluorescence spectral lines to be studied with a circular variable filter (CVF) and a Fabry-Perot (FP) interferometer used in tandem. The instrument can separate Rayleigh scattering, Raman scattering, and Flourescence with spectral and time spectroscopy. Spectral coverage is from 0.5 to 1.1. micron, resolution is 2cm1` and sensitivity to parts per trillion. A conventional germanium detector of soft gamma rays or a novel gamma ray Compton scattering telescope system proprietary to PHI will map isomer radiation from the alpha decay of uranium of plutonium for nuclear WMD applications. PHI has assembled an outstanding technical team to perform this research and this team will show the feasibility of these concepts in Phase I. In Phase II, PHI hopes to guide the team to develop a prototype in a timely and cost effective manner. The aforementioned team includes: Dr. Anthony Hull of OCA Applied Optics Co. of Garden Grove CA, and Dr. Theodore Gay of PHI. Consultants include: Iowa State and Penn. State (Meteorology Dept.). All participants have many years of experience in the state of the art. Anticipated Benefits: The benefits and commercial applications of this proposed device include: Analysis of air pollution at low cost with a light weight, compact sensor constant monitoring and control of pollution from public utility and aircraft turbines; analysis of complex semiconductor and catalyst structures, such as superlattices; and portable analysis of biological compounds for real time diagnosis of disease.",

In the proposed effort, a methodology is described/prototyped for including material properties data (MPD)into polygonal databases which can be used as input to IR scene simulators.  Two methodologies representing opposite ends of the spectrum are: 1) inclusion of MPD data layers for every polygon which results in high storage requirements and is computationally inefficient but offers the highest degree of flexibility and fidelity, and 2) the use of precomputed \"radiance texture maps,\" for each of the DMA single layer.  This method is computationally fast, has low storage requirements, but suffers from reduced flexibility and fidelity.  PRA believes the solution lies in a combination of these two methods, where tradeoffs determined by simulator designers and scene dynamics drive requirements.  Using an adaptation of methodologies PRA has already developed to produce input databases for the GENESSIS terrain model and Sensor Vision real-time scene generator.

The approach relies on the detection of small refractive indexchanges at the surface of the interferometer. When receptor molecules are immobilized on theinterferometer surface, the subsequent binding of specific ligands results in a pronounced refractiveindex change. An assay based on this approach has a number of key advantages: l) it is rapid (equal toor less than 15 minutes), 2) it is sensitive (picogram/milliliter range), 3) it is simple (no labeling ortagging) and 4) it is low cost (< $5 unit cost, no expensive analytic instrumentation).

        "abstract": "Optical link technology used for cryogenic focal plan array (FPA) readout not only is immune to electromagnetic interference, but also can reduce the heat load of the Dewar.  Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes the use of a vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL), in conjunction with fiber optics, as the key element of the optical link for cryogenic FPA readout. The VCSEL-based optical link would provide the best system performance (as compared with other optical link technologies) including power dissipation, thermal stability, optical coupling efficiency and insertion loss, optical signal contrast ration, component reliability and optical packaging stability.  Together with the optoelectronic system-engineering experience provided by POC, we firmly believe that the proposed VCSEL-based cryogenic optical link is the right choice for success.  In Phase I, a number of VCSEL-based optical link designs will be analyzed an devaluated. Their trade-off study will also be presented.  A laboratory experiment will be carried out to demonstrate feasibility and potential.  Finally a Phase II demonstration prototype plan will be developed in Phase I.",

        "abstract": "Advances in integrated circuit fabrication require large numbers of high resolution masks for lithographic purposes.  State-of-the-art lithographic tools have showed good submicron resolution, but are generally made on chrome-coated glass.  The associated chrome coating, writing, photoresist processing, and etching have produced enormous chemical waste for the IC industry..  Physical Optics Corporation proposes a high-energy-beam sensitive glass as the mask blank for mask fabrication.  The mask's pattern can be written into a thin layer of an ion-exchanged glass medium by high energy beams, like E-beams, deep UV, or short wavelength laser beams (180-200 nm), with high resolution (~0.2 um).  The writing can also be performed by longer wavelength beams (400 to 900 nm) on an E-beam pre-exposed mask blank using an erasure mode.  Low cost mask writing and replication provide enormous advantages.  Stability of the masks under actinic radiation is expected.  Phase I will demonstrate the concept's feasibility, good resolution, and high optical density in the darkened areas.  A cost effective mask making machine will also be designed.  Phase II will produce a new generation mask machine, based on the high-energy-beam-sensitive glass technology.",

In this Phase I program, POX will emboss moth-eye structures on appliques supplied by 3M's Automotive Design Systems Division.  The large scale moth-eye appliques will meet the requirements of military specification MIL-P-3847A (USAF). This approach will enable POC to meet the environmental requirements and signature suppression needs of the Air Force. There are no toxic solvents, paints, or strippers involved in the embossing process.  Phase I will determine the maximum achievable holographic master size and demonstrate the embossing process on 3M appliques.

Next, POC will implement the optimum fuzzy rules based on the data \"cookbook.\"  In this procedure, POC will supply dynamic fuzzy programming techniques that can manipulate currently used sensors to generate pseudo-weights of malfunctioning or absent sensors.

If not treated properly, radiation errors can seriously jeopardize a space or missile mission.  In common practice, safety-critical computer equipment for space usually employs hardening combined with hardware redundancy to cope with radiation-induced errors.  However, this technology is expensive, especially for payload developers.  This project investigates an alternative, much less expensive architecture for the development of reliable payload controllers that relies on off-the-shelf computers and software, multi-programming, and on software implemented fault tolerance (SIFT) to achieve reliability.  In the SIFT approach, memory is replicated, and multiple copies of the same program are executed and correct results of computations are decided by majority vote.  The objective of the project is to design the architecture of a reliable payload controller, implement it, and to perform experiments that show its suitability to cope with gamma radiation.  Moreover, the techniques developed in this project will be computerized in a payload controller shell that enables payload developers to employ these technologies in payloads.

        "abstract": "A high response internal fault detection (IFD) and classification  system is designed for large permanent magnet synchronous machines  using multiple electromagnetic detection methods and thyristor  controlled stator winding isolation techniques.  Four broad categories  of stator faults including dielectric failures, short circuit faults,  core failures and open circuits are covered by the IFD.  Three IFD  control schemes are to be investigated and designed for specific  application to the 25,000 HP class PM machines of the Navy ASMP  project; these schemes include field oriented vector (FOV) detection  and magnetically polorized fiber optic detectors to determine  unbalances in the machine airgap flux and magnetic core flux.  The  result of using a field oriented vector yields optimum values for  terminal excitation in Volts/Hertz when the PM motor is operated by  inverter dirive under abnormal conditions occuring with stator winding  isolation.  The novel aspects of the approach in addition to the  150-300 microsecond response time include the ability to modulate the  thyristor-stator winding switching to avoid step functions in terminal  voltage or power and the ability to control the machine reactive power  flow in an optimum fashion.",

The sonar reflection data will be integrated to both differential GPS navigation and spot geotechnical measurements in a manner that will provide rapid large scale assessment of marine soil properties. The cumulative survey results will be presented, in real time, in the form of computer generated contour maps detailing dediment property variations in density, prosity, and shear strength.  A large portion of the sonar system development will be extracted from our Navy sponsored research 6(biography).  Minimal new research is needed for the actual sonar hardware component of this development effort.  The new research that is needed and  proposed will focus on developing the interface between the acoustic measurements and geotechnical measurements taken from such devices as penetrometers, instumented cones, vibratory corers, and other devices.  At selected site locations, the data from these measurements will be entered as ground truth into the system computer model.  The ground truth data is used in the computer program to calibrate the models that relate acoustic impedance to sediment properties 6.  This research will result in the design of a commercial low cost combined acoustic/geotechnical instrument that will perform rapid material resource assessment, pollution monitoring, and provide data for marine construction design.",

        "abstract": "We propose developing a diode laser-based full-spectrum Raman scattering instrument prototype incorporating fiberoptic coupling for rapid, continuous on-line and remote monitoring of fuels. Raman's narrow, well-defined peaks and its insensitivity to moisture contamination allow for full-spectrum detection with 0.1% sensitivity for liquids and with 30 to 60 second response times. Traditional Raman scattering performed with visible light excitation is not compatible with liquid hydrocarbon systems because of background fluorescence.  Conventional gas lasers have too short of a life and are too expensive for routine commercial instrumentation.  A semiconductor laser diode offers longer life than conventional lasers and can operate at near-IR wavelengths where sample fluorescence is minimized while taking advantage of the very sensitive and full-spectrum capabilities of silicon CCD array Raman spectrum detection.  Fiberoptic coupling allows the safe application of Raman scattering in hazardous environments, eliminates lag time, reduces maintenance of sample handling systems while affording remote location of vibration sensitive equipment. Laboratory results have demonstrated the ability to quickly measure gasoline components and parameters including individual aromatics, such as benzene, olefine contents, unique brand formulations, octane ratings and EPA-required oxygenated additives.  Phase I will compare the prototype instrument with laboratory results.",

The proposed radar will utilize a high duty-cycle kylston amplifier, low-noise amplifiers and a 2 m diameter antenna to achieve greater sensitivity than any existing millimeter-wave cloud radar.  Pulse-to pulse polarization switching will allow measurement of all important polarimetric quantities and will permit unambiguous measurement of velocity under high wind conditions using a dual-polarization pulse pair algorithm.  The radar system will also include a state-of-the-art data acquisition system implemented using commercially available VXI-based components.  In order to meet the Air Force's operational and scientific needs, Quadrant Engineering will consult with AF meteorologists and engineering staff to optimize system requirements.  These consultation will be carried out early in Phase I to pin down specifications for the radar, data system and mechanical layout.",

In addition, the transmit waveform cannot be easily altered or coded to take advantage of propagation and target characteristics. The Navy has expended a great deal of resources to correct these deficiencies in the back end signal processing. The innovative technique described in this proposal takes an entirely fresh approach: Alter the source to yield intrinsic clutter rejection properties, which can be exploited with proper signal processing techniques. The Phase I product will be an innovative impulse source design which provides the optimum coded waveform and the corresponding advanced signal processing.

Redox has synthesized transition metal complexes (CTC compounds) exhibiting potent in vitro activity against herpes group viruses. Significantly, the mode of action of these novel compounds differs from currently available antiviral nucleoside analogs. One CTC compound exhibits pronounced efficacy in the topical therapy of HSV-1-induced stromal disease in the rabbit eye. The chemical rationale for the synthesis of CTC compounds, coupled with preliminary biological activity analyses, suggests that other CTC modified complexes with active group substituents may demonstrate enhanced efficacy in topical therapy treatment of stromal disease. Phase I research identifies leading CTC compounds (3\u00c2\u00bf5 chemically- engineered, biologically-active compounds). In addition, Phase I research evaluates effects of these compounds in vitro and in vivo on HSV-1 recovery and clinical progression of ocular HSV-1 stromal disease development and epithelial keratitis in rabbits. Phase II includes selection of 1 or 2 leading CTC compounds for further development as single-agent therapy against HSV-l induced ocular stromal disease in the rabbit. Additionally, Phase II in vitro studies will investigate the mechanism of CTC antiviral activity at functional (protein products) and other molecular targets in HSV infected cells.",

This method performs D/C using nonlinear signal information, based on techniques developed from the theory of Chaotic dynamics. Preliminary tests on real-world data sets, recently supplied by Navy personnel, indicate that this method will likely outperform most current linear classification methods, provided the signal of interest contains some nonlinear correlations. In addition, this method has been modified to perform D/C on transient signals (e.g. active pulses), with correspondingly good performance. These algorithms are quite computationally efficient, and can be implemented on any standard workstation environment. The current aim of the research program will be to further refine these methods, measure operating characteristics, characterize performance on a variety of real-world data sets, and especially to modify the basic scheme for a variety of other problems of interest to the Navy. Anticipated benefits to the Navy will be electronic signal recognition and classification technologies with significantly improved performance characteristics, especially suited to high noise environments.",

The product is an integrated system consisting of data generation and acquisition, data analysis, and mechanics modeling of intermetallic and metal matrix composite (MMC) materials.  The system will provide a complete multiaxial characterization of MMC response under multiaxial loading conditions in a form that is directly usable by test engineers and designers.  The research effort will build on work performed by the Air Force, and will focus on developing and validating a mechanistic method to characterize and describe MMC response under multiaxial stresses, general load orientations, and under thermal and environmental conditions of interest.  The development of the mechanistic method is a necessary pre-requisite to developing a technically sound and marketable product.  The work scope in Phase will involve both analytical modeling and experimental work.  The product will enable test engineers an improved interpretation of test data involving multiaxial stresses.  It will help designers by providing them with more complete material characterization information than is currently available to them for performing structural analyses.",

        "abstract": "It is well known that lasers are used in numerous military and civilian applications. Many laser-based systems, such as laser weapons, rely on beam steering. Advanced mass storage technologies, in particular, depend on scanning laser beams for reading and writing information. There has been a need for a beam-steering device that eliminates the complexity and the sluggishness of present methods and reduces the size required. Reveo has invented such a device. The so called, Electro-Optical Beam Steering Device, is ultra-compact and provides switching speeds of less than a microsecond, limited only by material constraints. There is no known technology that can deliver these levels of performance. The invention makes use of a new class of materials, cholesteric liquid crystal (CLC) polymers, that have the unique property of transmitting right-circularly polarized light and reflecting left-circularly polarized light or vice versa. In Phase I, various cholesteric liquid crystal polymer blends will be synthesized to optimize the transmit/reflectance properties. A simple prototype will be demonstrated to provide proof of concept. During Phase II, the resolution and complexity will be increased as well as exploring CLC polymers that allow different wavelengths to be transmitted/reflected. Anticipated Benefits: Electro-Optic beam steering is an ideal candidate for dual use. Advanced mass storage technologies, in particular, depend on scanning laser beams for reading and writing information. In addition to is use in mass storate, Reveo's radically new beam-steering device can also be used for many other purposes such as laser weapons, holographic storage, laser radar's, and other advanced optical systems.",

        "abstract": "The goal is to develop an assay to identify potential antiviral and anticancer compounds. Theassay is based on the activity of the cellular enzyme PKR (Protein Kinase RNA-activated). PKR is inducedby interferon and requires double-stranded RNA for activation. Activated PKR inhibits translation. Byinhibiting translation the cell stops viral replication since viruses are dependent on host translation. Someviruses (adenovirus, vaccinia virus, rotavirus, reovirus, poliovirus, influenza, and possibly HIV) haveevolved mechanisms to counteract this anti viral system by inhibiting PKR. The fact that manypathogenic viruses have inhibitors of PKR suggests that inhibition of this enzyme is important for viralreplication. In addition to its anti viral effects, PKR may also function as a suppressor of cell proliferationand tumor formation. Though tightly regulated, PKR apparently must be expressed and activated attimes during the cell cycle. In this context, activators of PKR may be useful as antitumorigeniccompounds, since activation could inhibit translation, perhaps leading to growth suppression of thetumor. The assay described here is a simple assay of PKR activity that can be adapted to identifyactivators of PKR, or to identify compounds that block viral inhibitors of PKR.",

Many of these specific problems have already been addressed by researchers working independently over the last six years at NASA laboratories, at NIST, and at academic institutions across the U.S.  By far the majority of this new control technology has been accomplished using seven degree-of=freedom, force/position-controlled manipulators supplied by Robotics REsearch Corporation.  This proposal outlines a project by which the Army can leverage this prior work by capturing the key elements of existing government-funded control software in a new open architecture, high-level robot control system.  We will formalize new architecture interfaces, assemble a library of existing robot control software, and modify that software to conform to the new open architecure --allowing it to be mixed and matched, dynamically, to meet the specific needs of particular applications.  By establishing appropriate software module interface standards, this software library will not be limited to use with RRC robots, but will operate any conforming robot system.",

Unfortunately, the image locations for the three primary colors of current SCLCDs are displaced longitudinally along the optical axis, making a light-weight, optical design difficult.  Diffractive optical elements have the potential to provide chromatic aberration correction, weight reduction, and aberration correction necessary for a SCLCD HMD.  During Phase I, we will analyze several concepts utilizing diffractive optics in color HMD systems.  The designs will characterize combination of beamsplitters and visor/combiners, including a tilted, off-axis visor/combiner.  These designs will demonstrate the light-weight optical and mechanical sub-systems required to implement the HMD display with a standard helmet shell. To demonstrate the color correction that can be obtained with diffractive elements, a fabricate a prototype system for a SCLCD, measure its performance, and compute the experimental results with design predictions.

In this program we will design an innovative IR zoom lens concept that uses lateral displacements of non-traditional optical elements to implement the zoom effect.  The zoom lens consists, in part, of two lateral-shift, variable-focus lens groups.  Our preliminary designs indicate that IR zoom lenses that employ lateral displacements may satisfy the size constraints and magnification ratios needed for missile guidance applications. We propose to design a f/4.5 LSI zoom lens with a magnification zoom ration of 4:1 that covers full fields of view ranging from 4.6 degrees to 18.2 degrees.  The lens is designed to image the full field onto a focal-plane detector that consists of 480 x 640 pixels with 20-micrometer center-to=center spacings.  Our goal is to keep the overall length of the zoom lens less than 150 mm, and to keep the diameter of the lens less than 75 mm.  The proposed design represents a unique and innovative approach to infrared zoom lens design.  As a result of this investigation, it is high likely that a new class of high performance, compact, infrared zoom lenses that area useful for missile guidance applications will emerge.",

        "abstract": "Ultra-high-purity silica microspheres recently were introduced primarily for analytical high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). However, these materials are expensive and are available only in limited configurations. The aim is to explore new methods for preparing strong, ultra-high-purity silica microspheres (or microspheroids) of lower cost in a variety of configurations (particle size, pore size, etc.) for various separation processes. The availability of these ultra-pure, less-acidic silica particles would permit superior separations of sensitive materials, particularly those of biological origins. Such particles also would produce higher separation yields with fewer problems than are associated with currently-available silicas. Porous silica microspheroids in the 2-20 mu m range are useful for analytical HPLC separations. Similar 10-50 mu m particles are well suited for preparative HPLC and as support media for high-performance solid-phase extraction and affinity chromatography. Methods also will be sought to prepare superficially porous microspheres to permit very fast separations of macromolecules with conventional HPLC apparatus, techniques and column-packing methods. The purpose of Phase I is to develop practical preparation methods to permit ultimate commercialization of the porous silica particles of this project.",

The existence ofconvenient, flexible, and powerful authoring tools for cognitive experimentation would accelerate theprogress of research and would reduce associated costs. We will develop an advanced laboratorysoftware package, the Neurocognitive Experiment Authoring Tool (NEAT), that will provide precisecontrol over event timing and stimulus characteristics with unprecedented flexibility and simplicity inexperiment design and implementation. NEAT will be optimized for experiments collecting reactiontimes, event-related potentials, functional brain images, and other cognitive and/or neural measurements.It will initially run under Microsoft Windows and will offer a user-friendly graphical interface forexperiment scripting, compatibility with popular multimedia tools for development of sophisticatedgraphic or auditory stimulus sets, facilities for timed control of external devices, and functions fororganizing and exporting behavioral datasets.",

        "abstract": "New integrated circuit fabrication technologies will require rapid positioning, with accuracies in the nanometer range, over a workspace spanning hundreds of millimeters. This will require a two-stage mechanism: One stage capable of moving over a large span, carrying a smaller \"mini-actuator.\" As the first stage approaches the desired position, the second stage actuator will take over and do the final positioning. The key to fast and accurate positioning combines several elements: Fast and controllable short stroke actuation; rapid long stroke actuation; low noise sensors; and control systems. Magnetostrictive actuators lend themselves well to the short stroke actuator. A high performance capacitive gauge will be used for feedback. Voice coil actuators are an established technology for rapid, large motions. Optical scales using diffraction interpolation are available with nanometer repeatability. These are suitable as long range sensors. A control system for a dual-actuator, one-axis ultraprecision positioner would use an LQR design, aimed at keeping the short stroke actuator near the center of its actuation span. In Phase I, we will design and build a one-axis positioner to demonstrate the dual-actuator. Anticipated Benefits: Rapid utlraprecision actuation is a key technology in all aspects of lithography. Nano lithography applications, important for commercial semiconductor fabrication, will benefit immediately from the techniques developed in this proposal. Speed of handling and therefore throughout will be enhanced.",

        "abstract": "Rugged, reliable, light weight Uninterruptable Power Supplies (UPS) are needed to protect critical C4I systems from power failure in the field environment. Commercially available UPS provide this protection but are prohibitively large and heavy. SatCon Technology Corporation proposes to develop an extremely small, light-weight Flywheel Uninterruptable Power Supply (FWUPS) for this application. This FWUPS would provide a solution to irregular voltages and frequencies, spikes, sags, surges, brownouts, and even blackouts that would normally result in loss of data or system crashes. The FWUPS will consist of a composite material flywheel with an integral motor generator making up the hub of the flywheel supported on frictionless magnetic bearings. A high effeciency electric drive accelerates and decelerates the FWUPS that can store more than 15 times the energy of a comparable weight battery. At a projected maximum rotation speed of 58,000 rpm, a 29.5 pound FWUPS module provides 15 minutes of energy at an output power level of 2Kw. This assumes the FWUPS spins down from full speed to half speed during discharge. A flywheel is superior to batteries or fuel cells in three important respects: 1) life, 2) hazardous material disposal, and 3) recharge time. In Phase I a state-of-the-art FWUPS will be designed, component research will be initiated, and the FWUPS concept will be tested. The Phase II program will complete the research together with the construction and test of a prototype system.",

        "abstract": "SatCon proposes to develop cost effective permanent magnet variable  speed drives (PM VSD's) for auxiliary applications on US Navy ships by  integrating high density drive electronics with innovative PM motor  designs to create a standardized set of rotating power modules with  common electrical and coolant interfaces.  SatCon will utilize its  recent experience in developing a very high power density electric  power train for the Chrysler Patriot hybrid electric race car with a  800-volt DC power distribution bus.  SatCon has designed high density  water cooled power inverters and a 500 -hp PM energy storage wheel for  this system.  Current PM VSD's, although more expensive than  across-the-line start induction motors of the same rating, are finding  many commercial applications where the benefits precise torque and  speed control and of higher power density outweigh the additional cost  and complexity.  Recent initiatives in the power distribution system  for Navy ships (Integrate Power System program) are leading to a DC bus  architecture which substantially mitigates the power electronics driven  cost disadvantage of PM VSD's versus across the line start induction  motors.  The reduction in startup power surge and the potential for  higher efficiency when delivering power to a variable load also offset  the additional cost of the PM VSD.  SatCon will study the cost  effectiveness and performance impact of introducing PM VSD technology  into ship board auxiliary systems and generate a preliminary PM VSD  design for a candidate ship board application.  Under Phase II SatCon  will generate detailed PM VSD's for several representative ship board  applications identified under Phase I.  Under Phase III a prototype of  a selected PM VSD design will be fabricated for ship qualification.",

The Phase I project would concentrate primarily on demonstrating the rapidly tunable OPO transmitter.  The critical subsystem technologies on which the overall system is based are:  an efficient, compact, high PRF, diode-pumped, green laser; a low-threshold, rapidly tunable, Ti:sapphire laser; a simple NCPM OPO, tunable via tuning of the pump only; and a patented methodology for constructing a tunable laser rangefinder.

        "abstract": "The overall objective of this effort is to develop all-solid-state pulsed driver technology to efficiency power plasma discharge sources used in IR countermeasures. The driver technology to be developed is based on high pulse rate Insulated Gate, Bipolar Transistors coupled with nonlinear magnetic pulse compression and new fractional-turn output transformer technology developed at SRL. The IGBTs act as a primary commutator and are used to switch the I joule of energy stored at 500 VDC in the primary energy storage capacitors to form 5 usec pulses. Two stages of nonlinear magnetic pulse compression and a fractional-turn output transformer are then employed to compress these pulses to the 20 kV/80 nsec pulses required to charge the peaking capacitors at the plasma discharge load. Circuitry will also be installed to increase the efficiency of coupling electrical energy to the rapidly varying load impedance represented by the plasma discharge. The all-solid-state driver will be designed to operate continuously at repetition rates up to 10,000 pulses per second and to have an operating lifetime of greater than 100 billion shots. In Phase I, Science Research Laboratory (SRL) will make the necessary modifications required to increase the pulse rate of an existing SCR-commutated copper vapor laser driver to 10,000 pps. These modifications will include replacement of the SCRs with IGBTs and upgrading the pulse compression modules, the thermal control systems and the driver trigger system. This modified driver will then be tested into a load circuit which simulates time-varying plasma discharge loads. The driver will be tested to full performance specifications and any performance deficiencies will be corrected. Phase I will culminate in the final engineering design of a prototype all-solid-state driver which will be fabricated and tested at SRL and then delivered to a selected Navy site in Phase II.",

        "abstract": "Tritium is handled routinely at laboratories in the United States, Canada, Japan, and Europe.  There are several applications for nondestructive assay of solid tritium-contaminated samples including environmental clean-up, routine assay of tritium handling equipment, assay of fuel elements used by fusion reactors including the proposed ITER reactor, and routine monitoring of fission reactor core materials.  Present technologies for the assay of medium-level tritium-contaminated solid samples either require substantial sample preparation or rely on surface contamination alone.  Preparation of solid tritium-contaminated samples poses the problem of further contamination and thus should be avoided if possible.  The only method that offers high sensitivity, accuracy and safety is calorimetry.  Since the average energy of tritium decay is well known (+/- 0.3%), the level of contamination can be directly inferred from the nuclear heating of the contaminated material.  The sensitivity of the technique improves tremendously at low temperatures (8 degrees K).  Fortunately, these temperatures can be reached using mechanical refrigeration rather than liquid cryogens, reducing the complexity and cost of the final system.  The device envisioned would be fully automated with a sensitivity of 1.5mCi (0.6GBq), an accuracy of 0.3% and a production cost of less than $40,000.  In addition to the assay of tritium, this device could be used to assay other low-energy radioactive contamination.",

        "abstract": "This project addresses the important area of programming support for high performance parallel computing. At present, message-passing systems like PVM or MPI are the most widely used software systems for parallel computing, both for defense applications and for applications in the commercial and industrial sectors. Message passing is conceptually quite straightforward and should be relatively easy to apply. Unfortunately, however, the fact that today's message-passing systems are based entirely on the use of subprogram libraries, rather than on language-level constructs, makes them much harder to use than they should be, particularly when handling heterogeneous or unstructured data and computing environments. In this work we will develop suitable precompiler technology to handle many details of message-passing systems automatically, while still preserving the ability of sophisticated users to control the low-level details when that is required. We proposed to investigate language-level front-end systems that will interface with widely-used message-passing products like PVM or MPI to reduce the burden on users by providing, among other things: much cleaner and more intuitive syntax; semantic support for compile-time or link-time error checking; and automatic handling of many general situations at run time. ANTICIPATED BENERFITS: This project will lead to tremendously increased use of message-passing systems by making them much easier to use. By eliminating many programming complexities, compiler-level enhancements allow quicker development of programs that are more correct and run faster. Products based on this work will enable commercial and industrial firms to gain far greater benefit from parrallel computing, and to do so faster, with less-specially-trained personnel, and at far lower cost than with current library-based message-passing systems.",

The technology is based on speed, attenuation, and scattering of vibrational waves (acoustic/ultrasonic/elastic) propagating in or through tanks and pipes are sensitive to the materials inside.  By measuring the characteristics of certain modes of propagation, we can sense thickness of scale in the pipe, or level of the fluid in a tank.  We divide the problem into two:  non-invasive tank level and non-invasive pipe scale measurements.  A sensor for the former, based on this technology, has already been developed by two of the principle investigators for measuring the fluid level in large petroleum tanks.  The proposed Phase I effort consists of four tasks to evaluate the feasibility of the approach, an analytic and an experimental task for each of the problems.  The analytical tasks are for determining the optimum modes of propagation and for predicting the wave speeds and attenuatioins under the various conditions.  The pipe related experimental task will test several acoustic/ultrasonic methods of measuring scale thickness.  The tank experimental task will test the capabilities of the existing sensor for gaging actual shipboard sewage tank levels.",

        "abstract": "This proposal addresses the problem of mitigating the effect of unwanted structural modes of the V-22 aircraft on the performance of the flight control system. The current system designed by Bell Textron uses five nonself-adaptive filters in the frequency range of 2.3-5.5Hz on SAHRS and VYROS outputs and pilot stick control inputs to remove the effect of unwanted structural modes. The filter frequencies are scheduled with airspeed and conversion angle but not with respect to gross weight. The purpose of designing a self-adaptive notch filter is to compensate for changes in frequency due to effects such as gross weight and to achieve narrow filters with minimal phase lag. The use of a System Identification approach based on the Stochastic Realization Algorithm (SRA) is proposed. SRA has been shown to be very effective in estimating the parameters (frequencies, dampings, mode shapes) of structural modes of aircraft and flexible structures using measurement of outputs only. SRA does not require any special inputs and produces accurate results even with short data lengths and under poor signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) conditions. SRA has been tested on NASA flight test data from X-29 and F-18 and found to outperform other methods of structural mode parameter identification. The design of a self-adaptive notch filter using SRA results is based on a Kalman Filter. During Phase I, the feasibility of removing the unwanted effects of the structural modes using SRA-KF will be demonstrated on simulated and flight test data from the V-22 aircraft. Phase II will involve hardware/software integration and flight testing. Bell Textron, designer of structural filters for the V-22 flight control system is expected to support the proposed effort.

        "abstract": "\"Eighty percent of the cost of high volume optoelectronic components are in the package\" according to Bob Weissman of HP (Optics News, Aug 1993). To allow laser diodes to serve various markets, cost is a primary consideration. Given their present relatively high cost, laser diodes are not economical in many systems. The present high fabrication cost of laser diode sources is caused mainly by the cost of packaging, because of the variety of packages needed for each diode and application. In this proposal, SDL will utilize an economical universe packaging technology based on a versatile micro optical bench fabricated in silicon. The silicon optical benches can be fabricated at low cost and are easily adapted to many laser diode sources; the number of packaging components is greatly reduced and the resulting package is smaller and more robust. In Phase I of the program SDL will investigate the feasibilitgy of the technology by demonstrating the coupling of a laser diode to a single mode waveguide. In Phase II, the research will be extended, among others, to an individually addressable fiber coupled laser array on a Si optical bench. Merging existing laser diode technology and Si optical benches lowers individual unit cost and permits the use of laser diodes in a variety of useful commercial systems. Anticipated Benefits: The proposed Si optical bench technology will lead to an across the board reduction of cost of packaged laser diodes for markets including telecommunications, data storage, displays, sensing, printing, cutting and welding and medical lasers.",

THE INNOVATIVE USE OF VOICE RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY WILL PROVIDE PATHOLOGISTS AND TECHNICIANS WITH HANDS-FREE AND SIGHT-FREE OPERATION DURING ANIMAL HANDLING, NECROPSY, AND MICROSCOPIC EXAMS. USING A WIRELESS HEADSET, THE ACTUAL COMPUTER EQUIPMENT CAN BE STORED IN A CLEAN LOCATION AWAY FROM ANIMAL ROOMS AND OTHER WORK AREAS. IN PHASE I, A PROTOTYPE SYSTEM OF LIMITED SCOPE WILL BE DEVELOPED AND FIELD TESTED. THIS WILL VERIFY THE FEASIBILITY OF THE PROJECT AND PROVIDE A BASIS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A COMPLETE VOICE-DRIVEN PATHOLOGY DATA MANAGEMENT SYSTEM DURING PHASE II.",

        "abstract": "Next-generation aircraft and space-based sensors will significantly benefit from a combined aperture multi-spectral passive (visible to LWIR) and active LADAR capability for enhanced target acquisition, ranging, tracking, and discrimination performance; and lower size, weight, power, and cost.  Typical DoD missions include advanced AWACS sensors; TMD and NMD interceptors and surveillance systems; cruise missile guidance/control; terrain mapping and photo-reconnaissance; laser guided missiles/weaponry; aircraft landing systems; laser secure links and environmental sensors.  The driving technology areas are ultra-lightweight all-reflective telescopes and wide field of regard (FOR), high precision pointing/stabilization control.  SSG's proposed concept includes (1) a very lightweight, all-reflective, off-axis, common shared aperture silicon carbide (SiC) telescope for combined, inherently aligned and a thermalized passive/active operation; and (2) a wide FOR, very precise and compact pointer with internal stabilization control.  The proposed hardware must satisfy visible level performance under stressing thermal and vibration environments. SSG is proposing a highly innovative SiC process technology that provides very fracture tough (drop on cement floor) and extremely highly damped (50 times better than a metal) structural assembly at very low cost, which is critical for stressing aircraft and rocket applications.  The wide FOR pointer uses a meridional 2-axis mirror assembly (size is independent of the large azimuthal angular extent), and a highly innovative fringe counting optical encoder capable of less then 0.5 microrad accuracy, repeatability, and jitter control over the large angular extent.  Phase I will develop a combined aperture passive/active sensor concept with supporting analyses and critical technology assessment; Phase II will be a hardware demonstration of critical technology area(s) in a \"flight-worthy\" configuration.",

Longer wavelengths require thin layers whose \"critical thickness\" for dislocation-free strain begin to approach atomic dimensions due to the use of a binary (e.g. InP) substrate. We propose to use bulk ternary InAsyP1-y substrates which have larger atomic spacing thus allowing longer wavelength operation. In Phase I we will deposit strained layers of InGaAs and InAsP upon a bulk grown InAs .1P.9 substrate and demonstrate and deliver a ridge-waveguide laser at 2.3 um. In Phase II we will work with Crystallod, Inc., (a new substrate manufacturer) to fabricate InAsyP1-y (Y + 0.4) and InzGa1-zSb (.1 < z < .3) substrates to push the wavelength of strained layer antimonide-based lasers out past 3 microns. Dr. Ramon U. Martinelli of SRI David Sarnoff Research Center will consult. A Phase I extension option is included.",

The system will employ a resolution enhancement technique that will provide rapid quantitative submicron surface deposit and surface roughness measurements on semiconductor wafers. The system will be capable of resolving vertical heights and lateral widths less than 100 Angstroms and have a working distance greater than 10 cm in air or vacuum.  In addition, the system will be able to provide and identification \"signature\" for different materials deposited on the wafer surface.  The scanned image of the wafer will provide sharp delineation between surface steps, scratches, and particles whether insulating or metallic.  With the rapid response and long working distance, the system can be used for in-process wafer evaluations.  Coupled with the systems capability to identify deposits on the wafer surface, the electronically enhanced optical data can lead to analyses through SPA to directly control the processing of silicon wafers in production environments.",

Signatron has for over 20 years been a pioneer and leading developer of channel simulators for a wide range of special purposes, including radar, sonar, and Satellite, microwave, troposcatter, HF, and meteor scatter communications. The objective of the proposed effort is to provide a new hardware simulation capability that can, in effect, operate faster than real time by using Importance Sampling (IS) techniques to artificially emphasize error-generating events. Signatron has used IS in many radar and communications computer simulations and has identified the key issues affecting faithfulness of the simulation, particularly the difficult issues relating to the hardware simulation. While IS simulation is relatively simple for memoryless systems, it is less efficient, and generally more complicated, for the most common case of systems with memory. A novel approach for adapting the IS simulator to a system, and solving the problems with unknown delay with memory, is proposed. The Phase I effort will study the implementation issues and a validation methodology. A general purpose additive noise simulator design will be developed and the extension to multiplicative (fading) systems will be evaluated using IS techniques already developed at Signatron. The specification for the Phase II advanced development will be developed to meet the widest range of military and commercial applications possible.",

        "abstract": "The principal objective of this proposed effort is to develop a generic sensor for real-time verification of bonding integrity of materials at the micro-level, which include but are not limited to ball bonds, wedge bonds, solder joints, internal and external delamination of traces & lid sealing of microcircuit packages. As demonstrated in the following proposal, this will be a non-contact sensor with high speed, sensitivity and precision specifically for performing detection of micro-detachment of joining materials. The backbone of this technological thrust is base on recent development of illumin-optics technology for microelectronics by Simpex and laser ultrasonic technology by Idaho National Engineering Laboratory, Department of Energy. The measurement of the bond integrity of balls and wedges is accomplished through a non-contact method by using lasers for both generation and detection of ultrasonic waves passing through the bond. Simply, our Micro Laser Ultrasonic Optical Sensor represents an automation of the classical \"tap test\" in which an object is struck in some fashion and an experienced listener determines the adhesion integrity from the sound generated. This technique is much improved from the traditional ultrasonic/acoustic technique. The object need not be contacted, the excitation is much gentler than that required in a contact test, and the whole approach lends itself to automation. Anticipated Benefits: This effort will provide a strong foundation for high resolution and high speed sensors for determining attachment integrity of micro-dimensional material layers. This technology can be adapated to numerous applications such as thick film & thin film, deposition processes for microelectronics, joining of metals and other joining processes with unknown micromechanical properties. These sensors will help reduce scrap, down time, eliminate many manual inspection steps, save time and money,and increase quality.",

        "abstract": "The need for versatile and economic industrial scale technologies for culturing anchorage-dependent mammalian cells is becoming more evident. This is a result of the increasing demand for vaccines and the use of mammalian cells for some of the new, emerging biopharmaceuticals. Microcarrier beads in bioreactor systems are being applied as a large scale production method. SoloHill is developing a family of unique microcarrier products which are superior to those currently available. The overall aim is to develop a novel small microcarrier bead (38-63 micrometers) which will foster the aggregation of cells. This will encourage the use of microcarriers for conditions where higher cell densities have been shown to be advantageous. Specifically we will (l) demonstrate that higher cell densities can be achieved under conditions where extensive clumping occurs. We will characterize the bead-to-bead clumps on small (less than 63 micrometers) and large (150-212 micrometers) beads. And, we will (2) demonstrate that cells maintained under conditions of high cell density on clumped beads are metabolically active and produce higher levels of useful products including infectious virus than cells grown under conventional conditions (in which clumping is minimized).",

Desirable characteristics for such sensors include portability, low power requirements, high sensitivity, rapid response and low maintenance.  A semiconductor laser based sensor can meet all of these requirements.  Recent advances in semiconductor laser technology have produced lasers which have better mode quality, improved tunability, increased output powers and a wider range of wavelengths (particularly in the near-IR and visible regions).  We are proposing to build a laser diode based system for continuous emissions monitoring of NO2[sub] and Oxygen which shall take advantage of these recent technological advances. Phase I research will concentrate on optimizing the technique for measurement of NO2[sub].  A diode laser-based sensor for simultaneous measurement of multiple gases will be designed for subsequent development and field testing in Phase II.",

        "abstract": "Jet engines and other turbine combustors operate at high pressures, with turbulence length and time scales on the order of 100 um and 100 us.  Accurate experimental characterization of turbulent reacting flows is critical for validating computational fluid dynamics and chemistry codes used in the design of advanced turbine combustors.  Laser-based diagnostics are typically used to characterize velocity, temperature, and concentrations of key chemical species in flames.  However, most diagnostics in current use are not capable of resolving all of the time and length scales of interest.  We propose to develop new diagnostic tools and techniques that take advantage of the characteristics of high-power, ultrashort pulse, mode-locked Ti:sapphire lasers. Phase I emphasis will be placed on the development of a spatially resolved pump-probe absorption technique to determine absolute number densities of the free radical CH, a key trace species in flames.  Further Phase I work will study the use of picosecond degenerate-four-wave-mixing (DFWM) for CH number density measurements.  This background-free technique promises to have greater sensitivity than absorption based techniques.  Measurement of OH and NO using these techniques will require the third harmonic of Ti:sapphire.  Determining the design for laser systems to measure these trace species will lay the foundation for the Phase II effort.",

This new detector is being proposed for use in two applications: (1) as a spaceborne sensor and (2) as a commercial laboratory instrument. First, the TUVIR (Total and Ultra-Violet Irradiance Radiometer) is a completely new spaceborne instrument which utilizes the new radiometer to measure the total solar radiation and the ultraviolet solar radiation in narrow, ozone related bands. The 200 to 250 nm ultraviolet component of the sun's radiation provides the energy for the formation of ozone in the Earth's atmosphere. This narrow spectral band only contains 0.14% of the total solar energy. To accurately monitor long term changes in this radiation a 600 fold improvement in sensitivity is required over current cavity radiometers. TUVIR provides this sensitivity. Second, commercial laboratory radiometers with greatly improved sensitivity are also required to accurately measure the output power of low level continuous wave lasers and to act as transfer standards from cryogenic calibration standards that operate in vacuum chambers. This High Precision Cavity Radiometer has the long term precision and absolute accuracy to provide a transportable reference standard with a durable shelf life.",

Materials constructed with unique spectrally-selective optical properties are proposed that allow narrow-band \"color signatures\" to be created such that only the properly equipped sensors can \"see\" them. Materials previously developed are described, and means for adapting them to the MWIR thermal spectrum for this application are proposed for phase-1. Advanced materials for operation in harsh environments are proposed for development during subsequent phases 2 and 3. Our years of accumulated experience in developing complex focal-plane assemblies (FPAs) is applied to the creation of integral detector-readout spectrometer devices that significantly reduce the cost of high-performance hyperspectral sensors making them affordable for law-enforcement, counter narcotics, counter terrorist, shipment tracking, and various industrial process uses.

These initiators are versatile and can be formulated in most radiation curable coatings - acrylates such as polyolacrylates, epoxy acrylates, silicon acrylates and urethane acrylates; unsaturated polyesters such as those used to coat particle board and as structural reinforced construction materials; and epoxies such as bis-phenyl-A-epoxide.

A large part of the analysis process is spent extracting, assimilating, and transforming output data of one model into the compatible formats for input to other models.  Previous approaches include manually modifying the source code to accommodate the appropriate formats or building model-specific post processors.  These methods require a code change or translator for each model-to-model pair and are not cost effective.  Furthermore, current methods don't accommodate version upgrades or new models, and lack the ability to efficiently aggregate model data.

S*R will extend the semantic code analyzer software being developed under current SBIR programs for the Army and NASA, to provide automated analysis and classification of data requirements for FORTRAN models.

Use of PDT in conjunction with laser hyperthermia to treat cancerous tissue offers potential advantages over PDT alone. The proposed diode laser instrument would provide optical power at two different wavelengths (separately or simulataneously), one in the red (690 nm) for PDT and the other in the near-infrared (~800 nm) for laser hyperthermia. The instrument would incorporate two monolithic, independent, linear arrays of high efficiency, state-of-the-art, strained-layer, quantum well lasers each coupled to a common fiber-optic delivery system. Unlike present commercially available argon-pumped dye lasers, which are extremely large, inefficient, and expensive, the proposed laser system will be sufficiently small, portable, and cost-effective to permit easy installation and operation in hospitals and clinics. The prototype instrument will be evaluated by conducting combined PDT and laser hyperthermia on mouse tumors at the Massachusetts General Hospital's Wellman Laboratories of Photomedicine. Anticipated Benefits: Successful Phase I and Phase II programs would lead to commercialization of a highly versatile instrument for either separate or combined photo-dynamic therapy and laser hyperthermia treatments. The envisioned diode-laser-based system would be extremely compact and portable, and could be sold profitably at a fraction of the cost of existing laser systems with similar treatement capability.",

In Phase I, Spire's ECR plasma reactor, which ha already demonstrated thin film deposition of InxGa1-xN alloys, will be instrumented with plasma diagnostics, and a series of nitride depositions will be conducted using metalorganic (MO) sources of the Group III metals and nitrogen.  PAI will modify an existing finite-element model of plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) to account for ECR plasma heating, magnetic anisotropy, and MO sources.  The deposition model will predict the effects of plasma parameter changes on thin-film deposition.  Good Phase I results would lead to Phase II in which refined plasma diagnostics will be installed and operated on the ECR plasma reactor to gain in-depth understanding of volume and surface processes during plasma deposition.  Plasma modeling will be extended to include effects of non-uniform plasma heating, magnetic field effects on transport, and more complete cross-sections to better model the plasma chemistry.

Here we propose using even thinner (8 um), higher efficiency (25% AM0), InGaP/GaAs tandem cells, bonded to thin coverglasses, to greatly increase the cell power density.  Cells are first fabricated on thicker substrate wafers, and these wafers are later removed once the cells are bonded to thin (3 mil) CMG coverglasses.

This informational package will help them make informed treatment decisions by encouraging an on-going dialogue with physicians and family members. The videotape helps patients to recognize that myths and fears can be investigated and overcome, rather than allowed to become barriers to effective treatment and prevention efforts. In Phase I, State of the Art, with nationally recognized medical advisors, will produce a script, creative plan, and storyboards for the video, and a draft of the accompanying brochure. These materials will be reviewed for medical accuracy and patient relevancy by the project physician advisors. Three focus groups of prostate cancer patients and their family members will test the material to ensure it meets its patient education goals. The package will be completed in Phase II and distributed through bulk sales to pharmaceutical manufacturers for distribution to doctors' offices.

        "abstract": "The goal of this proposed research is to prove the feasibility of a software solution to provide intelligent tutoring for the REGIS Training Center. Because students often learn best by example, we intend to design a tutoring system around example problems. We will apply the Artificial Intelligence (AI) technique of Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) to elicit and represent the example problems (or cases) and provide explanations to students on problem solving techniques. The system would be sensitive to a student\\'s knowledge o problem solving principles and tailor the teaching sessions accordingly. The body of knowledge contained in the system could be expanded over time simply through addition of more problems. An intelligent tutoring system is an exciting supplement to traditional classroom instruction. It offers the possibility of individualized teaching and allows the student to work at his own pace, somewhat mitigating the problems of staff cutbacks and increasing complexity of subject area. In Phase I, we will design a generic intelligent tutoring system using a case-based reasoning paradigm. The feasibility of the system will be proven through implementation of a proof-of-concept prototype in a specific domain.",

With the advent of numerous friendly and threat and neutral forces operating in the world, the task of consistently classifying numerous acoustic targets has become extremely difficult. Acoustic Intelligence data on hundreds of target types is impossible to memorize or quickly reference. Operators need a passive acoustic data classification tactical decision aid which can help them reference important parametric data and assist in accurate and timely classification of the targets. This proposed effort will research and develop a design for a Passive Acoustic Classification (Computer) System with a robust acoustic parameters data base and algorithms to query the data base, score the results of data base matches using math algorithms, and interact with the operator/analyst in reaching timely and accurate target classification.",

The range of 500 to 5,000 Vdc will be used in evaluating voltage level performance when connected to the micro SMES.  In this proposed phase I effort, a matrix will be made to indicate the possible combinations of coil voltages and currents, inverter dc voltage levels and capacities, and dc-to-dc converters. Criteria such as predicted reliability, ease of up-and-down sizing to different power levels (modularity), efficiency, physical size and weight, ease of production and cost will be used to select an optimal design of the dc-to-dc interface.

It has been demonstrated to achieve fast large flux variation and flux transient reduction, thereby significantly improving the layer composition control.  We propose to incorporate flux sensor ion the lIMO design so that the flux can be accurately measured and adjusted in real time.  Long term cell drift may also be corrected.

At the 340 degree F oil sump temperature of this engine, the antiwear/anti-oxidant additives in most AIPS candidate lubricants are rapidly decomposed. Several additive functions are thus lost. This can result in severe bearing wear and corrosion, high overhead wear, rapid loss of base number and sludge deposits that plug oil filters and turbocharger oil feel lines. Surfaces Research has developed novel antiwear/anti-oxidant additives with superior high-temperature stability and effectiveness. These additives can potentially replace less stable additives in all AIPS lubricant formulations. The major Phase I activities will be synthesis of the new additives and determination of their tribological performance, oxidation-corrosion performance, and compatibility with other additives in a full diesel engine formulation. The best new additive and full formatulation will be delivered. A small feasibility demonstration in Phase I will address a separate issue. We will contribute to improved performance of an engine demonstrator with extreme upper cylinder temperatures by demonstrating new Surfaces Research solid lubricant technology.

All balls work simultaneouly at constant velocity and torque throughput: micro torque ripple, increased bandwidth, high stiffness. The rolling balls minimize heat generation, while the flat disks maximize heat dissipation. Axial preloading accomodates thermal, environmental, wear effects, extends lifetime, and cooperate with flat disks for zero backlash and high precision. High volumetric and operational efficiency. Expanded envelope. Robust with low compliance. Cams formed in face of flat disks for lower cost manufacturing. Fabricate in metals, ceramics. No maintenance ceramic disks.

The Phase I effort will produce a system design and a demonstration of integrated voice/eye interaction for a mission planning problem as well as a full development plan for both ground-based and airborne (in cockpit) M3PI systems.  The Phase II effort will develop the M3PI on a UNIX workstation and will interface to a ground-based mission planning system.  Further development (e.g., during Phase III) will be oriented toward extending the functionality of the M3PI to enable airborne real-time mission planning and replanning support, developing a portable voice/eye interaction application programming interface (API), and re-packaging the system for delivery as a workstation/PC add-in board.  This voice/eye system can be used in a wide variety of applications that emphasize use of emerging non-command-based interaction such as virtual reality and agent-based user interfaces.  Moreover, the technology will augment conventional command-based HCI technologies that support hands-busy applications and applications for the physically challenged.",

Our approach will decrease the distortions caused by second and third order harmonics of a signal and by cross modulation with other signals in the laser transmitter. Multi-function phased array antennas require low loss, high dynamic range RF/microwave transport from the array elements to image processing receiver electronics located many motors from the antenna.  This type of application finds an excellent fit with fiber optic links when the laser transmitter and optical processing receiver provide low noise, wide- bandwidth high dynamic operation and the connecting fiber provides low thermal coefficient of delay.  TACAN proposes a novel broadband high power, low chirp laser link with high dynamic range to support command, control, communications, and intelligence (C31) systems for transporting up to 5 GHz signal spectra with high SNR and extremely low distortion.",

        "abstract": "There are a wide variety of needs for improved monitoring and analysis of trace chemicals in several different industries. These needs are increasingly being addressed with immunoassays specific of individual analytes or for restricted chemical classes.  The sensitivity, selectivity, and cost of standard assay kits has earned wide acceptance for this approach. Relatively recently, some immunosassay for chemically hazardous materials such as pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls, and petroleum hydrocarbons have become commercially available.  Our work will combine immunoassay techniques with evanescent-wave fiber-optic fluorescence spectroscopy to fabricate a continuously operating sensor.  The ability of evanescent-wave spectorscopy to discriminate between fluorescent molecules on the surface of the fiber probe and those in the bulk solution eliminates the need for a washing step.  Our work will combine the picomolar sensitivity of previously demonstrated fiber-optic immunoassays with a semipermeable membrane to contain the immunoreagents in a continuously operating probe.  This type of sensor will, therefore, retain the advantages of selectivity and sensitivity offered by immunoassay.  The capability ot function as a continuously operating probe while retaining this level of performance, however, opens up significantly new opportunities not offered by any existing technology.",

The proposed approach can have a very large bandwidth, is adaptable to many protocols, can interface to fiber-optic systems, and car be implemented for novel secure wavelength-hopping communciations systems. There are numerous applications of this technology. For example, in the communications arena our approach can provide hundreds of non-interfering wavelenths for dense wavelength division multiplexing for private/secure communications and noninterfereing wireless communications links. Applications exist in terrestrial and satellite free-space communications links as well as fiber-optic communications links. The very large bandwidth of our approach allows gigabit to terabit/sec wireless communications technology.

The proposed thin strut ramp will have a smooth front edge to reduce the pressure gradient and vorticity.  Pressure, temperature, Mach number, and concentration will be surveyed two-dimensionally by the diagnostic systems developed by Taitech, Inc.  Three-dimensional CFD simulations will be used to investigate mixing behavior.

TechnoLink proposes to investigate the development of a novel sensing device based on state-of-the-art fiber optic technology.  Integration of the proposed sensor into a PC based contiuous monitoring system would result in the ability to provide early warning of potectial seal failures for compressors, valves, pumps, flanges, and other piping facilities which might cause fugitive emissions.  During the proposed Phase I effort, TechnoLink will demonstrate the applicability of this technology be developing system level performance requirements and conducting prototype testing.  The successful completion of Phase I will result in a system level design specification.  Completion of Phases II & III will yield a commercially available VOC monitoring system that will benefit both the Federal Government and private industry by eliminating the need to perform time consuming manual inspections and allowing the prediction of incipient failures.",

        "abstract": "The proposed research examines the feasibility of using solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) for shipboard electric power generation by substituting new ceramic anode materials able to operate with logistic fuels. These anodes would allow the SOFC to operate witha range of reformed fuels containing sulfur impurities (including coal derived fuel gas, diesel fuel, jet fuel, and natural gas), avoiding the cost and space requirements of fuel pre-processing. The Navy is evaluating the feasibility of using fuel cell technology for various electric power generation applications on surface ships including auxiliary service and eventually, propulsion. The operating characteristics of fuel cell systems, particularly the solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC), are an attractive alternative to the gas turbine generator. Experiments will focus on identifying and formulating potential anode compositions that incorporate the use of mixed conducting materials, test them for total conductivity, stability, and sulfur tolerance using resistance measurmeents and XRD analysis. Promising materials will then be tested in IRF single cells with sulfur-containing fuel to show the feasibility of sulfur-tolerant SOFC operation. Anticipated Benefits: Demonstrating the feasibility of using sulfur tolerant anodes in single cell fuel cells in Phase I will permit further development and optimization in Phase II of sulfur tolerant anode materials and fabrication techniques and multi-cell IRF SOFC stack testing. Phase III will initiate prototype system development.",

        "abstract": "The need for a reconfigurable, affordable, DIS compatible Combat Vehicle Simulator is immediate. The training needs of the Army Reserve and National C3uard (ARNG) are unique, ARNG personnel operate actual equipment infrequently and therefore have little opportunity to maintain proficiency in basic skills. Some might perceive that proficiency training has become less critical as a result of the new technologies, but this is not the case. For every technology based advantage provided, there is an added training requirement. Additionally, the ARNG utilizes a variety of vehicles, such as the MlAl, MlA2, M2AI, M2A2, CEV, and others. The training needs of the ARNG center upon the mastery of sophisticated systems in a dynamic, complex environment. A comprehensive reconfigurable system must address all of these factors. Development of a low cost Reconfigurable Combat Vehicle Simulator (RCVS) is proposed. This system will be reconfigurable across vehicle types and training applications to support a broad range of training requirements. The underlying concept is targeted to provide a capability that supports both narrow purpose training requirements (such as home based desktop training) and unconstrained vehicle simulation within the DIS environment. This will allow a single system to meet the needs of most Armories, exploit reusable subsystems (such as DIS interfaces), and simplify the procurement and fielding process. Anticipated Benefits/Potential Applications - Reconfigurable Simulation Technology will be able to be applied in a wide range of both military and commercial applications. The proposed capability will benefit the nation because, for the first time, it will be cost effective to provide a comprehensive, multi-task, multi-echelon capability to Armories in sufficient quantities to have a substantive impact on the ARNG readiness.",

        "abstract": "Weapon system components such as electromechanical or hydraulic servos, valves, or gears often exhibit deadzone, backlash, or hysteresis behavior caused by stiction, magnetism, or other phenomena.  These nonlinear features can strongly influence or dominate system response in many situations.  Feedback control laws for such systems must manage the impact of these types of nonlinearities on system performance.  However, it is frequently difficult to characterize these nonlinear effects precisely, and this hinders the design of effective control laws.  In this proposal we describe a design methodology for the robust, adaptive feedback control of systems with backlash, hystereses, and deadzones.  We shall investigate the tradeoffs in complexity between classical robust control methods (Hinfinity control) and parametric adaptive control methods.  The adaptive control methodology is based on the use of (adaptive) inverses for the nonlinear phenomena (backlash, hysteresis, and deadzones) and adaptive update laws for the linear plant uncertainties.  The methods have produced good results for small problems.  In this work we will (i) extend these adaptive control techniques to treat more complex, MIMO systems; (ii) compare their performance with H-infinity control designs for a test article resident at the Picatinny Arsenal.",

        "abstract": "Rolling bearings for aircraft gas turbines and power drives are designed to meet endurance requirements basically determined according to the Standard fatigue life calculation method. This method is based on Lundberg-Palmgren fatigue life theory as modified by reliability, material and lubrication factors. As aircraft load and speed requirements increase, this method results in bearings of increasing size, significantly adding to the size and weight of the gas turbines and power drives. Newly developed life prediction methods recognize the existence of a fatigue limit stress. If the stresses an operating bearing experiences do not exceed the limit stress, the bearing can achieve infinite life. Bearings designed using these new methods will have smaller diameters, weigh less and cost less. This Phase I project will investigate these new methods and analytically evaluate the utility of each by comparing fatigue lives so predicted with actual fatigue life data accumulated by aircraft engine and power drive manufacturers. To conduct the evaluation, computer programs BBEAN2 and CYBEAN2 will be used for bearing performance analysis. Assuming reasonably successful comparison of actual and analytical data, a Phase II project will further develop a practicable method using the fatigue limit stress for aircraft bearing design.",

        "abstract": "The Department of Defense is actively pursuing the development of Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROV). Visual feedback provided to the operator is a major component required for the successful control of the ROV. The proposed approach utilizes dual units of a patented TRI imaging system, Omniview TM, in conjunction with a helmet tracking system to create a stereo image representation of the remote environment. A wide angle (180 degrees) image is used as the input and portions are displayed stereoscopically based on the head position of the operator. The Omniview approach uses a composite video camera and wide angle lens to capture the image and then transforms the image to perform pan, tilt, and rotation without any mechanical movement minimizing payload size and weight. As a result, this omnidirectional viewing system can be inserted into confined areas such as existing ROV's and provide visual feedback not possible with other approaches. Advantages of this approach in remote viewing applications include miniaturization, cost reduction, multiple image delivery from a single camera, fast response, high resolution, and greater reliability. Since no actuators are used, the approach can be miniaturized and hardened to provide an effective solution to remote viewing applications. The operator will be fitted with a helmet tracking system which will be utilized to control the pan, tilt, and rotation functions of the specialized electronics. This effort will address through design trade-off studies, the specific issues associated with the Free Flight Rotorcraft Vehicle (FFRRV) including integration of the operator helmet tracking system and the additional electronics required for the stereovision pan, tilt and rotate.",

Metallic transducer mounting brackets are heavy, are constructed from expensive corrosion resistant metals, use expensive corrosion resistant surface treatments and incur high maintenance costs due to replacement in as little as two years of service. High corrosion rates in mounting hardware also reduces sonar system availability and reliability. TRI/Austin is presently developing high performance polymer composite sonar transducer brackets to replace the current metallic TR-317 and DT-276 transducer brackets. The prototype brackets are injection molded using advanced polymer resin systems highly loaded (40% to 60%) with long glass fibers and mineral fillers. Cost analyses have shown that the TR-317 composite brackets cost under $10 to manufacture at low volume mold runs (100 parts) and cost under $5 at high volume mold runs (10,000 parts). Current metallic TR-317 brackets cost the U.S. Navy $19 per part. Laboratory and field tests have shown these composite brackets to be a viable low cost, light weight, high strength and corrosion free replacement for their metallic counterparts. Recent MIL-S-901-D explosive shock testing has qualified the brackets for Fleet development. TRI/Austin will utilize the expertise and composite material technology advances gained from its current development effort to develop polymer composite replacement brackets for the metallic DT-537 and DT-538 hydrophone assembly brackets.",

        "abstract": "The M109 A6 Howitzer is a tracked combat vehicle that operates at high power and in very hazardous environments. During vehicle field use and engine maintenance operations, the current M109 radiator is vulnerable to core damage causing the loss of engine coolant. Loss of engine coolant immobilizes the vehicle because the excess engine heat cannot be removed leading to engine seizure. The proposed innovation would utilize heat pipes incororated into a radiator design that would be damage resistant, redundant, reliable, and maintainable. A heat pipe radiator can contain enough redundancy that even if a significant number of the heat pipes were damaged, the radiator would continue to operate. The loss of a heat pipe does not result in the loss of th eengine coolant or immobilization of the vehicle. As a result, the heat pipe radiator will improve the damage resistance, operation, and survivability of the M109 AG. The Phase I technical objective will be to design an innovative M109 A6 heat pipe radiator that is damage resistant, reliable, and maintainable. A representative segment of the heat pipe radiator will then be fabricated and tested under simulated service conditions. At the completion of the Phase I effort, a firm foundation will have been provided for the Phase II effort which involves fabrication and testing of a prototype heat pipe radiator installed in an M109 A6 Howitzer.",

The new card provides the interface to a modified industrial-grade ORBCOMM transceiver. The low-cost remote transceiver performs all the necessary operations to support two-way data communications via the VHF ORBCOMM satellites.

The ALTAIR radar at Kwajalein Missile Range does not presently correct for off-boresight errors.  Since the typical 15-minute pre-mission checkout is not adequate for full calibration, there is a need for a model that can be updated using limited pre-mission checkout data.  A program is described for identifying, analyzing, and evaluationg candidate monopulse models and associated calibration procedures to permit accurate off-axis tracking of depolarizing targets.

The composites are precision cast by pressurized infiltration casting. Thin-walled ceramic molds are used to contain and infiltrate complex-shaped preforms. A powerful, user-friendly 3D graphics software package is used to interactively create mold designs from the solid model of MMC component to be cast. The software can also analyze the casting process in transient 3D to simulate mold filling. Solid freeform fabrication technology is used to directly tool ceramic molds geneated from CAD solid models, which eliminates intervening steps and part-specific tooling. This increased flexibility allows for rapid design changes, dramatically reducing the cost and lead time involved in casting complex shape MMCs. Computer integrated manufacturing incorporating solid freeform fabrication will establish pressure infiltration casting as a new paradigm for affordable and timely manufacutring of near-net shape metal matrix composites and components.

Anticipated Benefits: The enabling technologies to be developed under this Phase I program will provide affordatble processing and manufacturing technology for rapid production of lighweight, complex shapes MMCs for primary and secondary aircraft structural applications requiring a combination of high stiffness or high strength at low weight.

        "abstract": "A system is proposed which can provide coarse/passive and fine/active imaging in a staring mode at 95 GHz (W-Band) for the purpose of defeating multipath effects in ground-to-ground fire-control systems. The system makes use of efficient focal-plane scanning and modern digital baseband processing, having the potential for a wide range of target recognition, tracking, guidance, and other intelligence gathering functions. Multipath effects are suppressed through an electronically steered radiation pattern with dual nulls and novel signal processing algorithms. This approach effectively allows for rejection of the indirect signal and permits elevation tracking of the direct-path signal only. The leap-ahead technology behind these concepts is based on extensive background at UBC Inc. in two-plane, dual-polarized monopulse tracking systems. The proposed Phase I effort will focus on adapting related developments from existing UBC programs to the ground-to-ground scenario, leading to a preliminary system design. It will also include verification through analytical techniques of the ability to resolve representative targets of interest in this critical environment.",

It has been shown in our laboratory that organic contaminants can be mineralized in the aqueous phase using dioxygen over noble metal catalysts at temperatures between 120-160C.  Work to date has been an outgrowth of regenerative life support research for manned space exploration.  Contaminants studied have been those typical of hygiene wastepaper, humidity condensates, and urine distillates. Organics occurring in highest quantity in these streams are low molecular weight alcohols, carboxylic acids, and urea. Experimental results have indicated deep oxidation of mixed contaminant streams containing dissolved organic compounds at concentrations between 10-200 mg/L.  Studies comparing this technique with other methods of organic contaminant reduction such as photocatalysis, UV oxidation, and photoelectric oxidation have shown heterogeneous catalysis to be vastly more effective in terms of reactor size and residence time requirements.  Extension of this technique to organics commonly polluting ground and surface waters is proposed.  Contaminants studies will include trichlorethylene (TCE), 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP), JP-4, and decachlorobiphenyl (a PCB).",

        "abstract": "The quality and durability of coatings produced by virtually all thermal spray techniques could be improved by, among other things, increasing the velocity with which coatings particles impact the coated surface and by better control of the chemical and thermal environment seen by the particles during flight. A new and innovative approach to thermal spraying is proposed that can increase coating particle velocities at least a factor of two to the 2000-2500 m/sec range. These higher coating particle velocities and improved control of the particle chemical and thermal environment during flight are expected to lead to dramatic improvements in coating quality. The process deliberately uses a repetitively pulsed, high temperature plasma jet. Such jets can be used in a variety of ways to melt and accelerate coating materials. In Phase I we propose to develop a computational model and an engineering design of a prototype pulsed plasma jet spray device. Successful development of this sprayer is expected to open up new markets for thermal spray applications and to improve the performance and durability of hypervelocity gun launch components and high temperature rocket components, and industrial applications where traditional spray is limited. Superior quality thermal sprayed ceramic and refractory metal coatings that are denser, harder, more uniform, lower porosity, and higher adhesion and cohesion. Potential commercial applications include advanced coatings for gas turbines, internal combustion engines, rocket components, load-bearing surfaces for heavy equipment, and ceramic substrates for electronics.",

The radar data collection multiple apertures in the vertical or cross-track dimension. The angle-of-arrival signal processing, applied following the image formation, is based on the wide band Estimation of Signal Parameters Using Rotational Invarient Techniques (ESPRIT) algorithm. Under the Phase I proposal, a existing simulation package will be modified to evaluate the buried target detection problem for a variety of radar parameters and target environments. Additionally, under Phase I an existing set of data collected by the ERFM rail SAR in accordance with the angle-of-arrival SAR specifications will be analyzed. These data will include a variety of buried targets such as pipes, drums, wire mesh, comer reflectors. The radar will sweep a band from 100 MUz to 1100 MHZ providing imagery with with 1 foot range and cross-range resolution. The objectives of Phase I are proof of concept with real data and sensitivity analysis to ascertain the optimal radar configurations and the limitations of the technique.

        "abstract": "The use of MCTs in a high-frequency, high-power motor controller requires soft switching. While MCTs are known to possess significant forward drop advantages over IGBTs or MOSFETs, their switching behavior is much more complex. Conventional PWM switching of MCTs at high frequency leads to significant switching losses due mostly to a current tailing problem during device turn-off. Zero-voltage switching or zero-current switching can be achieved with a resonant link inverter. This can greatly reduce the switching losses. However, this approach leads to higher voltage and/or current stresses on the devices.  A novel fixed-frequency, soft-switching, PWM, bidirectional, inverter/rectifier circuit employing state vector modulation is proposed for use as an MCT, four quadrant, AC induction motor controller for an electric vehicle. This new circuit topology combines the low stress advantages of the PWM circuit. Digitally controlled state vector modulation provides for low torque ripple over a wide range of motor speeds with fixed-frequency PWM control. ANTICIPATE BENEFITS: Significant potential exists with electric vehicle for the government. In the defense sector EVs can be used military utility vehicles. In the civilian sector EVs are ideally suited for post office vehicles. Virginia Power Technologies is particularly interested in using this SBIR funding to generate a product for commercial use. We feel that the commerical uses could be unlimited if an MCT based motor controller shows cost and performance advangates over an IGBT-based motor controller.",

        "abstract": "Malaria is a major parasitic disease in humans. Induction of immunity to the sexual stages, found in the mosquito host, is an important element in controlling the parasite. We have devised a conjugate vaccine by coupling protein or hapten-protein to very high molecular weight dextran. This highly multivalent construct induces rapid, persistent, high titer antibodies in the absence of adjuvant, even in neonatal and immune- compromised animals. We propose to use this vaccine construct to induce transmission blocking antibodies to a key B cell epitope of the sexual stage specific protein pfs25. While pfs25 can induce blocking antibodies, multiple immunizations with adjuvant are required. Furthermore, it has considerable homology to human epidermal growth factor. In Phase I, we will evaluate the peptide conjugate vaccine for (1) optimal peptide orientation and valency, (2) suitable carrier proteins, (3) route of immunization and (4) ability of antibodies to bind recombinant protein. This technology can be applied to other peptide-based conjugate vaccines and may be particularly valuable in conjunction with sporozoite and merozoite peptide vaccines now in development.",

We will develop immunodots and ELISA assaysfor diagnosis of Lyme disease based on cloned B. burgdorferi gene products that are humanimmunogens. We shall investigate sensitivity and specificity of these diagnostic assays. The B.burgdorferi gene-products to be used are distinct from all characterized antigens as OspA/OspB, OspC,flagellin and heat-shock proteins. In preliminary studies, we have identified a single clone from alambdagt11 B.burgdorferi library expressed in E. coli that reacted only with sera from patients with Lymedisease and failed to react with anti-OspA/OspB, anti-OspC or anti-flagellin antibodies or with sera fromnormal controls. We will finish sequencing the DNA from this clone, characterize its gene-productsbiochemically, and partially purify them. Recombinant B. burgdorferi antigens will be analyzed in ELISAand immunodot binding assays for their ability to discriminate between sera from patients with Lymedisease, sera from patients with other infectious diseases, and sera from normal individuals.",

        "abstract": "The use of Kinetic Energy Weapons (KEW) against theater missile threats, such as the SCUD, require fast and accurate aim point determination to maximize the kill probability. It is proposed to incorporate an innovative active three-dimensional (3-D) imager in each KEW seeker to significantly improve the kill rate. The proposed 3-D Imager uses a rugged laser diode illuminator to generate a narrow beam of RF modulated, near infrared (NIR) target illumination and a special charge-coupled device (CCD) camera which measures the phase shift of the backscatter radiation, relative to the transmitter illumination, for each pixel in the camera field. The camera will use a noncryogenic low noise, high-speed silicon CCD focal plane array (FPA), capable of being synchronously gated, for the 3-D imaging. An advantage of this 3-D imager is that the critical parameters of range, position, and velocity are read out directly with a minimum of algorithmic processing required. This can greatly improve system track performance by increasing the track loop bandwidth. A further advantage of sensing in the NIR is that any sensor window heating will have a negligible effect on imager signal-to-noise. Pre-selected aim points to ensure kill of weapon (nuclear, chemical, or biological); that is, to rupture the weapon case and not less important shrouds, etc. Commercial applications include: machine tool controls, industrial process controls, chamber and cavity inspection, IVHS vehicle control, satellite station-keeping and docking, and three-dimensional video for home use.",

Consequently, the ability to accurately simulate the electromagnetic chamber would give test personnel a tool to simulate chamber conditions before costly and time consuming setup efforts are begun.  Furthermore, a synthesis capability that optimizes the test configuration (placement of absorber, absorber type, system under test, source antenna location, diagnostic sensor placement, etc.) would the requirements of a planned experiment. We propose to build on our present anechoic chamber simulation capabilities to develop a Windows/PC-based simulation, analysis and synthesis program..  Phase I deliverables will include the Final Report and a working and useful prototype Anechoic Chamber Simulation, Analysis, and Synthetic Software Program.  Our program goal is to develop a software tool that will: run under MS Windows with intuitive and informative graphical interfaces that are easy to use by test personnel; accurately model the significant EM physics of the chamber, antenna, absorber, and higher order test asset interactions; compute test fidelity figures of merit easily interpreted by test personnel; and synthesize and optimize configuration solutions that will satisfy test requirements.",

        "abstract": "Current IR systems are extremely susceptible to electromagnetic and radio frequency interference (EMI/RFI) because they possess large apertures that present ideal front-door entry paths for EM radiation.  Significant amounts of EM radiation (400 MHz - 18 GHz) can penetrate and couple to the IR sensor and supporting electronics, which leads to a substantial degradation in systems performance.  EMI protection is critical to the survivability of the IR system and the system host (e.g., aircraft, satellite).  Conductive metal mesh coatings on external surfaces of IR windows reduce the EM/RF signal but are mechanically soft and easily damaged.  Surface doped semiconductors, such as gallium arsenide, have optical absorption and emission problems, while semiconducting carbide coatings, such as germanium carbide, suffer performance loss at the low end of the required temperature range.  QUEST Integrated, Inc. will investigate electrically conductive metal silicides and ceramics as erosion resistant EMI/RFI protective coatings for IR windows and radomes.  We will deposit selected materials as continuous film and as various mesh pattern coatings by RF plasma sputtering and study their shielding capability and IR optical transparency.",

Existing technology uses water as the working fluid that accelerates abrasive particles in high-velocity, highly coherent jets.  Despite successful demonstration and industrial utilization of the technology in cutting, cleaning, drilling, turning, milling, and surface-preparation operations, it remains poorly suited to important applications in which environmental considerations (safety, cleanliness, waste management) prohibit the use of liquid water.  For such situations, liquefied gases are emerging as attractive alternatives to water as the UHP jet working fluid.  In Phase I, the feasibility of obtaining cryogenic UHP jets of liquid nitrogen (LN2) will be demonstrated, and their cutting performance will be investigated.  An in-house cryogenic pump will be used to pressurize the LN2 up to 150 MPa (22 ksi).  This phase of the project will explore the thermodynamic conditioning of the UHP cryogen necessary to achieve jets with cutting power; optimal nozzle materials and geometries; and hardware requirements for addition of abrasive particles to the cryogenic jet.  It is anticipated that the proposed work will verify the feasibility of incorporating cryogenic liquids into UHP jet technology.  Exploratory tests will also be performed to entrain abrasives into the LN2 jet.  Based on these data, conceptual design of a prototype system will be prepared for fabrication and testing in Phase II.",

These substances conserve their biological activity until activated with light stimuli of theappropriate wavelength. A sequential, three stage experimental approach will be employed to prove thefeasibility of the method, culminating in the demonstration of feasibility in an experimental animal model.In addition to enabling NO delivery in an animal with intact neuronal and vascular circuits, the methodwill apply to other neurotransmitters. Based on the design flexibility, a wide range of potentialapplications are envisioned: in micropharmacology experiments (where the delivery method promisesbetter temporal resolution and receptor coverage than currently available micropharmacologicaltechniques, including microiontophoresis and pressure ejection); in new in vivo and in vitro macropharma-cological approaches; and in new photodynamic cancer therapies.",

The language-independent architecture is supported by XML, the Xinotech Meta-Language, and XPAL, the Xinotech Pattern Abstraction Meta-Language, which is an XML component.  Xinotech proposes to use its metalanguage infrastructure, more specifically XPAL transformations, to instantiate its visual environment for the fully automatic and semi-automatic translation from various FORTRAN dialects to Ada 9X.  THis translation environment will also support parallel FORTRAN dialects and parallelization of resulting Ada 9X sources to meet specific architectures.  Xinotech's existing Ada 9X Philosophy Transformation Library will be embedded into the translator to enhance its abstraction capabilities into the higher level Ada 9X models.  The existing Xinotech Object Prospector will be instantiated to support the selection of FORTRAN candidate objects for object-orientation under Ada 9X.",

The front-end tools will include the Xinotech Composer for syntax-directed construction, integrated with the Graph Abstractor, and the rules-based Guideliner. The back-end will make use of a static scheduler, a translator and a dynamic scheduler, already existing for PSDL. XPAL, the Xinotech Pattern Abstraction Language, will be used to specify transformation libraries to generate Ada from PSDL, and to partially generate PSDL from existing Ada programs imported into the environment. An XPAL library to transform and restructure PSDL specifications will be provided. This library will be very useful in automating and speeding the rapid prototyping process through iterative modifications needed to finalize the design. This environment will have a uniform, open architecture supported by GUI's such as Motif and Windows NT. Anticipated Benefits/Potential Applications - Successful development of this effort will produce a complete, practical environment for rapid prototyping of real-time embedded systems using PSDL targeted for Ada. This environment will significantly increase programmer productivity and the reliability of large software systems, as well as early detection of design flaws which are unattainable goals with the present software development methods and tools.",

This new instrument is an extension of the well-proven multifilter rotating shadowband radiometer and would substantially improve the existing measurement of solar UV-B radiation.  The instrument is of the filter spectrometer type and utilizes a micro-processor controlled rotating shadowband to block out the sun's disk when the measurement of the diffuse component is being made.  The measurement of the global solar radiation is made with the shadowband rotated to its nadir position.  The subtraction of the diffuse component from the global irradiance value results in a value for the direct component.

Visual appraisal of fiber diameter and variability of diameter is not an accurate, consistent method, but it is still used throughout the world.  Microprojection is the most accurate method of determining fiber diameter but it is slow, tedious and expensive.  Variability of diameter is extremely important to textile manufactures due to the advent of advanced high speed processing equipment.  The Sirolan Laserscan, AFIS System, and OFDA are computerized methods of fiber diameter measurement that stimulate microprojection and eliminate problems associated with microprojection.\n\nThe objective of this proposal is to investigate the possiblity of adapting new electronic technology to replace technology developed in the 1920's and still currently used today.  Samples will be collected that represent all of the types of wool produced in the United States.  These samples will be measured by the microprojection method to provide average fiber diameter and variation in diameter.

USAF supported development of a retrievable, portable Animal Noise Monitor (ANM) in 1989 and an enhanced second generation version during 1994-1995.  The weakest component of the current design is the electret microphone.  The proposed object of this research is to investigate use of a thin film transducer mounted inside the ANM case.  The thin film is a passive element that does snot consume electric power and eliminates many environmental constraints of microphones.  Preliminary experiments testing film performance bonded inside the ANM case show great potential. Limitations lie in the dynamic performance of the case, which has too many resonances in the frequency range of interest.  In finite element analysis, structural mechanics offers a simple means of studying effects of varying structural properties, such as thickness and shape, on structural resonances.  Phase I goals are (1) to isolate the film-bonding case surface area so that case size and vibration and ANM attachment mode do not affect the transduces response and (2) to modify the film attachment area so that its dynamic response meets acoustic measurement frequency requirements.  At least two case designs will be manufactured and tested to demonstrate proof-of-concept.",

Although there is no new physics involved in the operation of these optics, the ability to fabricate them economically is a recent innovation. These optics are intended to accept broad energy bandwidths of low energy x-rays diverging from a small source and re-direct them into a well collimated beam or to focus them to a small spot. Used with laboratory x-ray lasers they would collimate the poorly collimated radiation emerging from the linear x-ray laser plasma sources. When used for x-ray elemental analyses applications for the determination of elements with Z less than A1, they would revolutionize the use of wavelength dispersive spectroscopy in Scanning and Transmission (SEM and TEM) Electron Microscopy by increasing the sensitivity of detection of these elements and decreasing data collection times. If these optics were used in conjunction with energy dispersive spectroscopy, they would enable the use of smaller detectors resulting in better energy resolution and better SNR. In this phase I program, we propose to produce the prototype of a collimator which we will sell to OEM and aftermarket suppliers of elemental analyses equipment for SEM and TAM systems. Our optics will have applications in x-ray laser research, imaging fusion plasmas, x-ray microscopy, and crystallography.

        "abstract": "New, lower-cost launch systems require a modern, economical Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GN&C) system.  Microcosm has recently developed plans and prototype hardware for such a system with an order of magnitude lower cost than existing systems. However, a key problem is flight validation of the GN&C system without risking a high value payload or launcher.  The opportunity now exists to develop a complete, low-cost, generic flight GN&C package and validate the performance of the system on a near-term flight of the PacAstro PA-X sounding rocket.  Specifically, Phase I will demonstrate feasibility by specifying the components, demonstrating the flight computer, and verifying controllability through 6 degree-of-freedom simulation.  Phase II will deliver and fly the full GN&C system on the first PacAstro PA-X test flight, currently scheduled for 1997.  Phase II includes the development of actuators by PacAstro.  The results of Phase II will be to transform the PA-X flight from unguided to guided and controlled, thereby decreasing range safety concerns, and to create a fully developed and validated, near-term, low-cost, generic GN&C system for launch vehicles.",

        "abstract": "Systems & Processes Engineering Corp. (SPEC) proposed the development of a GaAs Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) for spaceborne applications.  Digital Gate Array ICs combine functions of many logic gates into a single chip to improve speed, weight, and power dissipation.  Field programmable gate arrays reduce cost to first functional chip by an order of magnitude.  Presently no FPGAs are qualified for space radiation environment.  The project applies GaAs technology to FPGAs to impact this problem and achieve higher speed of operation and increased radiation-hardness as compared to CMOS technology (GaAs IC technology provides 3X higher speed than non-rad-hard CMOS and at least 10X higher total dose radiation-hardness than rad-hard (CMOS).  Advantages of GaAs FPGA for space applications are: miniaturization of logic functions obtained without NRE costs to make a custom IC, costs for rad-hardening and reliability testing for space qualification can be amortized over many applications, high speed (clock at 100 Mhz to 1 GHz) obtained at modest power dissipation, and total-dose radiation-hardness is better than CMOS.  GaAs single event upset hardness can be achieved with standard rad-hard circuit design techniques.",

        "abstract": "Traditionally, the recording of high speed phenomena has required the use of film cameras; though providing very fast frame rates and high resolution, film is bulky, heavy, expensive, and requires considerable processing delay before the results from an event can be viewed. In recent years, advances in solid-state imager design have made high-speed video a viable alternative to film. High speed video, however, is not a fait accompli. The imagers are multi-port chips, with high bandwidth outputs at each port. The analog signal conditioning and digitization stages of the multiple high speed signals occupy a large circuit board area. Also, the digital clocking requires significant amounts of board space. We have confronted these issues in our prototype 640 x 480, 500 frame per second high speed camera. Such cameras are needed in government and industrial applicatons that call for a rugges, small package. Multi-chip modules provide a means to braoden the use of high speed video. During Phase I, we will research the market and cultivate a working relationship with a key customer. The MCM, with a high speed imager and associated multi-port processing and digitization, will be specified and suppliers will be chosen. An initial MCM design will be fabricated. During Phase II, the MCM will be developed and integrated into a high-speed, high-resolution (i.e., 500 @ 1000 fps) digital video camera. Anticipated Benefits: A high-speed video \"camcorder\" is ideal for acquistion of short time-scale phenomena. Armament research and surveillance are two government appplications; industrial uses will span the spectrum of high speed manufacturing",

        "abstract": "Asynchronous circuits offer the potential for significant power savings over traditional clocked logic. We propose to develop an electronic design, synthesis, and management tool targeted at low-power, asynchronous circuit design. We will Deliver a functional prototype tool during Phase I. The Phase II tool will support VHDL as a hardware description for high-level language input, technology mapping, automated layout synthesis, and limited built-in test support using boundary-scan and full-scan techniques. The tool will be tightly integrated into our existing low-cost component-level integrated circuit design and synthesis tools. The tool will support industry standard CAD formats, and frameworks (e.g., CFI) where appropriate. A novel self-timed synthesis methodology will be used, permitting fully statis circuits that have been shown to operate robustly with power supply voltages less than 1V. In conjunction with the inherent power advantages of asynchronous circuits, this power supply flexibility permits a wide tradeoff of operating speed vs. power consumption, in the field. During Phase I we will develop the asynchronous circuit synthesis software. We will also implement and deliver a prototype design tool, and fabricate a test IC designed with the tool. The Phase I design and prototype prepares for Phase II implementation of the complete system. Anticipated Benefits: Low-power asynchronous circuits are ideal for battery-driven notebook computers and personal digital assistants (PDAs). This is one ofthe tastest-growting IC application areas, with direct commercial application in mobile communications and portable computers. Powerful design tools are essential to the development of these ICs. We intend to directly market tools developed under this research effort.",

        "abstract": "In order to become a feasible human-interface technology suitable for operational deployment in high-noise environments, real-time speech recognition requires robust algorithms.  Robust speech processing would function as an intuitive interface to relieve crew work load and enhance crew safety, particularly in hands-busy and high-noise environments, such as cockpits.  We are currently developing an analog complementary metal-oxide-silicon (CMOS) silicon cochlea under an AF Phase II SBIR contract (AF41624-94-C-6004) specifically for noise reduction in cockpit speech-recognition applications.  During Phase I, we propose to merge traditional techniques with biologically inspired neural techniques.  The traditional technique uses a mel-cepstral coefficient (MCC) technique, with a vector quantizer (VQ) and a phoneme-based hidden Markov model (HMM).  The biologically inspired technique uses a noise-insensitive cochlear model, with a trainable, time-invariant learning vector quantizer (LVQ).  In the third algorithm, the traditional MCC front end passes its output to the LVQ classifier; for the fourth algorithm the cochlear model use the VQ codebook.  All four algorithms send their outputs to word-based HMMs.  In this way, we exploit the strengths of the front ends, as well as the strengths of the classifiers.  Word-based predictions from all four classifiers are fed to a neural classifier that selects the appropriate word spoken.",

        "abstract": "Modern aircraft contain more and more lightweight, but easily damaged, composite structures, with no way to detect in-flight composite delimination or impact damage. Innovative Dynamics (IDI) proposes to address this problem by developing a distributed damage detection system based on embedded piezoelectric actuators/sensors. Prior IDI research showed that an embedded piezoceramic actuator/sensor array can detect and locate delaminations, and that the embedded array had little effect on tensile strength. Other IDI research with metal aircraft has shown that surface-mounted arrays can detect damage to aluminum panels. We propose to adapt this simple, inexpensive \"engines off\" ground inspection technology for in-flight detection. First we will build up composite panels from V-22 materials and manufacturing specs and embed sensors inside (and on) selected panels. Panels will be destructively tested to assess how the embedded sensors affect tensile and bending strength, and the remaining ones will undergo shaker and ground run-up tests to simulate flight vibrations. We will develop a damage detection algorithm by applying proven signal processing/pattern recognition algorithms to sensor signals taken before and after induced delamination.",

However, the highest optical nonlinearities of the currently known RSAs are at least two orders of magnitude too low to be practically useful.  The focus of our Phase I project is to use Jet Vapor Deposition (JVD), a novel, versatile, and powerful vapor deposition technology, to fabricate RSA thin films with significantly enhanced optical nonlinearity, exploring various photophysical, photochemical, and nonlinear optical mechanisms, Broadband optical limiting will be realized by combining a number of RSAs with enhanced nonlinearities in difference spectral regions into a single film.  For practical applications, JVD optical limiting films may be directly applied to optical elements such as window and lenses, or optical instruments such as goggles and light sensors.
