# Project Description

The purpose of this project is to conduct an analysis of SBIR topics and winning abstracts over the past decade. The analysis will shed light on any trends in topics, desired research areas and/or desired tools in the analytics domain to highlight where future SBIR efforts may be warrented.

Per reference 1, "The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program is a highly competitive program that encourages domestic small businesses to engage in Federal Research/Research and Development (R/R&D) that has the potential for commercialization. Through a competitive awards-based program, SBIR enables small businesses to explore their technological potential and provides the incentive to profit from its commercialization. By including qualified small businesses in the nation's R&D arena, high-tech innovation is stimulated and the United States gains entrepreneurial spirit as it meets its specific research and development needs."

The goals of the SBIR program are four-fold:
* Stimulate technological innovation.
* Meet Federal research and development needs.
* Foster and encourage participation in innovation and entrepreneurship by women and socially or economically disadvantaged persons.
* Increase private-sector commercialization of innovations derived from Federal research and development funding.

The SBIR program is structured in three phases:
* <i>Phase I</i>. The objective of Phase I is to establish the technical merit, feasibility, and commercial potential of the proposed R/R&D efforts and to determine the quality of performance of the small business awardee organization prior to providing further Federal support in Phase II. SBIR Phase I awards normally do not exceed $150,000 total costs for 6 months.

* <i>Phase II</i>. The objective of Phase II is to continue the R/R&D efforts initiated in Phase I. Funding is based on the results achieved in Phase I and the scientific and technical merit and commercial potential of the project proposed in Phase II. Only Phase I awardees are eligible for a Phase II award. SBIR Phase II awards normally do not exceed $1,000,000 total costs for 2 years.

* <i>Phase III</i>. The objective of Phase III, where appropriate, is for the small business to pursue commercialization objectives resulting from the Phase I/II R/R&D activities. The SBIR program does not fund Phase III. Some Federal agencies, Phase III may involve follow-on non-SBIR funded R&D or production contracts for products, processes or services intended for use by the U.S. Government.

Each agency with R&D budgets that exceed $100 million are required to allocate 3.2% (FY 2017) of their R&D budget to these programs.

The 11 participating agencies from the federal government are as follows:

1. [Department of Agriculture][1]
2. [Department of Commerce - National Institute of Standards and Technology][2]
3. [Department of Commerce - National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration][3]
4. [Department of Defense][4]
5. [Department of Education][5]
6. [Department of Energy][6]
7. [Department of Health and Human Services][7]
8. [Department of Homeland Security][8]
9. [Department of Transportation][9]
10. [Environmental Protection Agency][10]
11. [National Aeronautics and Space Administration][11]
12. [National Science Foundation][12]
